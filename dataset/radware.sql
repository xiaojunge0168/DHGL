The proliferation of data from dozens of security products are outpacing the ability for security teams to process it. And budget and talent shortfalls limit the ability for security teams to expand rapidly.\nThe question is how does a network security team improve the ability to scale and minimize data breaches, all the while dealing with increasingly complex attack vectors?\nThe answer is automation.\n\n\nAutomation & Security\nFour in five organizations reported facing some form of network- or application-based cyberattack in 2017, according to Radware’s 2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report. Zero-day malware, botnets and Burst attacks – all sterling examples of automated attack vectors – saw significant increases in usage in 2017, according to the same report.\nThe numbers don’t lie. Cyber criminals are becoming savvier and their attacks increasingly automated. Furthermore, it’s evident that traditional DDoS mitigation methods, such as rate-based or manually-tuned protection, are outdated solutions to safeguard sensitive data in the wake of automated cyberattacks.\n [You might also like: Machine Learning Algorithms for Zero Time to Mitigation]\nIT organizations now face advanced persistent threats that are spearheaded not by human assailants, but by automated bots. Security personnel are no match for these intense, sustained attacks and are incapable of keeping up with the sheer volume of incoming threats. Legacy DDoS mitigation solutions that leverage rule-based event correlation can generate thousands of alerts in a 24-hour span. On a good day, an SOC can only investigate approximately a hundred.\nAdditionally, their ability to make quick and impactful decisions to manually address an attack is equally inefficient. Research shows that machine-learning botnets are now capable, in certain situations, of scanning a network for vulnerabilities and successfully breaching its defenses in less than 20 seconds.[1]\nThis is why automation is becoming such a powerful and effective component of cybersecurity. To combat the onslaught of incoming threats, organizations must employ an army of equivalent strength and sophistication.\nHow Attackers Leverage Automation\nCyber criminals are weaponizing automation and machine learning to create increasingly evasive attack vectors, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has proven to be the catalyst driving this trend. IoT is the birthplace for many of the new types of automated bots and malware.\nAt the forefront are botnets, which are increasingly sophisticated, lethal and highly automated digitized armies running amok over corporate networks. For example, hackers now leverage botnets to conduct early exploitation and network reconnaissance prior to unleashing an attack.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nThe Mirai botnet, which was made famous by its use in the 2016 attack on DNS provider Dyn, and its subsequent variants, embodies many of these characteristics. It leverages the infamous Water Torture attack to generate randomized domain names on a DNS infrastructure. Follow up variants use automation to allow the malware to craft malicious queries in real-time.\nModern day malware is an equally sophisticated multi-vector cyberattack weapon designed to elude detection using an array of evasion tools and camouflage techniques. Hackers now leverage machine learning to create custom malware that defeats anti-malware defenses. One example is Generative Adversarial Network algorithms that can bypass black-box machine learning models. In another example, a cybersecurity company adapted Elon Musk’s OpenAI framework to create forms of malware that mitigation solutions couldn’t detect.\nAutomation for Detection and Mitigation\nSo how does a network security team improve its ability to deal with these increasingly multifarious cyberattacks? Fight fire with fire. Automated cybersecurity solutions provide the data-processing muscle to mitigate these advanced threats.\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity & Customer Experience: Embrace Technology and Change To Earn A Customer’s Loyalty]\nExecutives clearly understand this and are ready to take advantage of automation. According to Radware’s C-Suite Perspectives: Trends in the Cyberattack Landscape, Security Threats and Business Impacts, the vast majority of executives (71%) report shifting more of their network security budget into technologies that employ machine learning and automation. The need to protect increasingly heterogeneous infrastructures, a shortage in cybersecurity talent and increasingly dangerous cyber threats were indicated as the primary drivers for this fiscal shift.\nIn addition, the trust factor is increasing. Four in 10 executives trust automated systems more than humans to protect their organization against cyberattacks, according to the same report.\nTraditional DDoS solutions use rate limiting and manual signature creation to mitigate attacks. Rate limiting can be effective but can also result in a high number of false positives. As a result, manual signatures are then used to block offending traffic to reduce the number of false positives. Moreover, manual signatures take time to create because identifying offending traffic is only possible AFTER the attack starts. With machine-learning botnets now breaching defenses in less than 20 seconds, this hands-on strategy does not suffice.\nAutomation, and more specifically machine learning, overcomes the drawbacks of manual signature creation and rate-limiting protection by automatically creating signatures and adapting protections to changing attack vectors. Machine learning leverages advanced mathematical models and algorithms to look at baseline network parameters, assess network behavior, automatically create attack signatures and adapt security configurations and/or policies to mitigate attacks. Machine learning transitions an organization’s DDoS protection strategy from manual, ratio- and rate-based protection to behavioral-based detection and mitigation (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Machine learning moves DDoS protection models from the left to the right\nAutomation is the future of cybersecurity. As cybercriminals become more savvy and increasingly rely on automation to achieve their mischievous goals, automation and machine learning will become the cornerstone of cybersecurity solutions to effectively combat the onslaught from the next generation of attacks. It will allow organizations to improve the ability to scale network security teams, minimize human errors and safeguard digital assets to ensure brand reputation and the customer experience.\n[1] https://www.cybereason.com/blog/botnets-honeypot-automation-cybersecurity', '\'automation\', \'Botnets\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Mitigation\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/battling-cyber-risks-with-intelligent-automation/');

Service providers and enterprises require expertise and knowledge to successfully deal with these threats.

Rate limiting can be effective in mitigating DDoS attacks but can result in a high rate of false positives. Manual signatures are used to pinpoint the offending traffic in order to reduce the number of false positives. However, manual signature generation process can take hours or even days.

In many cases, the initial signature is subject to false-positives, and further optimization takes place while measuring the effectiveness of the signature along the process.\nIdentifying the end of attack to stop mitigation.\n\nWhen attacks are fully randomized, positive protection models employs a signature generation logic that drops all traffic aside to legitimate traffic learn during peacetime.\n [You might also like: 5 Must-Have DDoS Protection Technologies]\nZero Time to Mitigation\nWhile negative and positive machine-learning algorithms are best at mitigating attacks with minimal false-positives, the process of automated signature generation can last for a few seconds. Sophisticated attackers may use this short window, where no signature is in place, to unleash a high-volume, short-lived burst attack at the target. This attack can last only few seconds and can bring down a service if no protection is in place. This is where rate-limiting is very effective. It limits the attack traffic to a rate that the protected services can sustain, and fill the mitigation gap of few seconds until the signature is ready.\nRate-limiting starts attack mitigation immediately in order to provide zero time to mitigation and is only used for this first occurrence. Once a signature is ready, it is automatically applied to mitigate reoccurring attack hits while eliminating false positives.

EVERYTHING\nThe world we live in can be a dangerous place, both physically and digitally. Our growing reliance on the Internet, technology and digitalization only makes our dependence on\ntechnology more perilous. As an executive, you’re facing pressure both internally (from customers and shareholders) and externally (from industry compliance or government regulations) to keep your organization’s digital assets and your customers’ secure.\nNew cybersecurity threats require new solutions. New solutions require a project to implement them. The problems and solutions seem infinite while budgets remain bounded. Therefore, the challenge becomes how to identify the priority threats, select the solutions that deliver the best ROI and stretch dollars to maximize your organization’s protection. Consultants and industry analysts can help, but they too can be costly options that don’t always provide the correct advice.\nSo how best to simplify the decision-making process? Use an analogy. Consider that every cybersecurity solution has a counterpart in the physical world. To illustrate this point, consider the security measures at banks. They make a perfect analogy, because banks are just like applications or computing environments; both contain valuables that criminals are eager to steal.\n \n\nThe first line of defense at a bank is the front door, which is designed to allow people to enter and leave while providing a first layer of defense against thieves. Network firewalls fulfill the same role within the realm of cyber security. They allow specific types of traffic to enter an organization’s network but block mischievous visitors from entering. While firewalls are an effective first line of defense, they’re not impervious. Just like surreptitious robbers such as Billy the Kid or John Dillinger, SSL/TLS-based encrypted attacks or nefarious malware can sneak through this digital “front door” via a standard port.\nPast the entrance there is often a security guard, which serves as an IPS or anti-malware device. This “security guard,” which is typically anti-malware and/or heuristic-based IPS function, seeks to identify unusual behavior or other indicators that trouble has entered the bank, such as somebody wearing a ski mask or perhaps carrying a concealed weapon.\nOnce the hacker gets past these perimeter security measures, they find themselves at the presentation layer of the application, or in the case of a bank, the teller. There is security here as well. Firstly, authentication (do you have an account) and second, two-factor authentication (an ATM card/security pin). IPS and anti-malware devices work in\nconcert with SIEM management solutions to serve as security cameras, performing additional security checks. Just like a bank leveraging the FBI’s Most Wanted List, these solutions leverage crowd sourcing and big-data analytics to analyze data from a massive global community and identify bank-robbing malware in advance.\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity & Customer Experience: Embrace Technology and Change To Earn A Customer’s Loyalty]\nTHE EXECUTIVE GUIDE TO DEMYSTIFYING CYBERSECURITY\nA robber will often demand access to the bank’s vault. In the realm of IT, this is the database, where valuable information such as passwords, credit card or financial transaction information or healthcare data is stored. There are several ways of protecting this data, or at the very least, monitoring it. Encryption and database\napplication monitoring solutions are the most common.\nADAPTING FOR THE FUTURE: DDOS MITIGATION\nTo understand how and why cybersecurity models will have to adapt to meet future threats, let’s outline three obstacles they’ll have to overcome in the near future: advanced DDoS mitigation, encrypted cyberattacks, and DevOps and agile software development.\nA DDoS attack is any cyberattack that compromises a company’s website or network and impairs the organization’s ability to conduct business. Take an e-commerce business for example. If somebody wanted to prevent the organization from conducting business, it’s not necessary to hack the website but simply to make it difficult for visitors to access it.\nLeveraging the bank analogy, this is why banks and financial institutions leverage multiple layers of security: it provides an integrated, redundant defense designed to meet a multitude of potential situations in the unlikely event a bank is robbed. This also includes the ability to quickly and effectively communicate with law enforcement.\nIn the world of cyber security, multi-layered defense is also essential. Why? Because preparing for “common” DDoS attacks is no longer enough. With the growing online availability of attack tools and services, the pool of possible attacks is larger than ever. This is why hybrid protection, which combines both on-premise and cloudbased\nmitigation services, is critical.\nWhy are there two systems when it comes to cyber security? Because it offers the best of both worlds. When a DDoS solution is deployed on-premise, organizations benefit from an immediate and automatic attack detection and mitigation solution. Within a few seconds from the initiation of a cyber-assault, the online services are well protected and the attack is mitigated. However, on-premise DDoS solution cannot handle volumetric network floods that saturate the Internet pipe. These attacks must be mitigated from the cloud.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nHybrid DDoS protection aspire to offer best-of-breed attack mitigation by combining on-premise and cloud mitigation into a single, integrated solution. The hybrid solution chooses the right mitigation location and technique based on attack characteristics. In the hybrid solution, attack detection and mitigation starts immediately and automatically using the on-premise attack mitigation device. This stops various attacks from diminishing the availability of the online services. All attacks are mitigated on-premise, unless they threaten to block the Internet pipe of the organization. In case of pipe saturation, the hybrid solution activates cloud mitigation and the traffic is diverted to the cloud, where it is scrubbed before being sent back to the enterprise. An ideal hybrid solution also shares essential information about the attack between on-premise mitigation devices and cloud devices to accelerate and enhance the mitigation of the attack once it reaches the cloud.\nINSPECTING ENCRYPTED DATA\nCompanies have been encrypting data for well over 20 years. Today, over 50% of Internet traffic is encrypted. SSL/TLS encryption is still the most effective way to protect data as it ties the encryption to both the source and destination. This is a double-edged sword however. Hackers are now leveraging encryption to create new,\nstealthy attack vectors for malware infection and data exfiltration. In essence, they’re a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\nTo stop hackers from leveraging SSL/TLS-based cyberattacks, organizations require computing resources; resources to inspect communications to ensure they’re not infected with malicious malware. These increasing resource requirements make it challenging for anything but purpose built hardware to conduct inspection.\nThe equivalent in the banking world is twofold. If somebody were to enter wearing a ski mask, that person probably wouldn’t be allowed to conduct a transaction, or secondly, there can be additional security checks when somebody enters a bank and requests a large or unique withdrawal.\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity & The Customer Experience: The Perfect Combination]\nDEALING WITH DEVOPS AND AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nLastly, how do we ensure that, as applications become more complex, they don’t become increasingly vulnerable either from coding errors or from newly deployed functionality associated with DevOps or agile development practices? The problem is most cybersecurity solutions focus on stopping existing threats. To use our bank analogy again, existing security solutions mean that (ideally), a career criminal can’t enter a bank, someone carrying a concealed weapon is stopped or somebody acting suspiciously is blocked from making a transaction. However, nothing stops somebody with no criminal background or conducting no suspicious activity from entering the bank. The bank’s security systems must be updated to look for other “indicators” that this person could represent a threat.\nIn the world of cybersecurity, the key is implementing a web application firewall that adapts to evolving threats and applications. A WAF accomplishes this by automatically detecting and protecting new web applications as they are added to the network via automatic policy generation.\nIt should also differentiate between false positives and false negatives. Why? Because just like a bank, web applications are being accessed both by desired legitimate users and undesired attackers (malignant users whose goal is to harm the application and/or steal data). One of the biggest challenges in protecting web applications is the ability to accurately differentiate between the two and identify and block security threats while not disturbing legitimate traffic.\nADAPTABILITY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME\nThe world we live in can be a dangerous place, both physically and digitally. Threats are constantly changing, forcing both financial institutions and organizations to adapt their security solutions and processes. When contemplating the next steps, consider the following:\n\nUse common sense and logic. The marketplace is saturated with offerings. Understand how a cybersecurity solution will fit into your existing infrastructure and the business value it will bring by keeping your organization up and running and your customer’s data secure.\nUnderstand the long-term TCO of any cyber security solution you purchase.\nThe world is changing. Ensure that any cyber security solution you implement is designed to adapt to the constantly evolving threat landscape and your organization’s operational needs.', '\'banks\', \'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'DevOps\', \'Encryption\', \'Hackers\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/executive-guide-to-demystify-cybersecurity/');

People are mostly aware of the Wannacry cyberattack that was launched through the use of DoublePulsar and EternalBlue malware, but what most people do not know is that several other groups earned millions of dollars by using the same malware to inject a cryptocurrency miner into thousands of Windows servers. Similarly, cyber criminals exploited vulnerabilities in Oracle’s WebLogic Server to deliver miners into the servers deployed at research institutes and universities. With continuous rise in cryptocurrency value, cybercriminals have been regularly upgrading their current malware to deliver and install cryptocurrency miners on servers. As the cryptocurrencies continue to become more and more popular, the world may expect to see a dramatic rise in malicious incidents.\nIn the next few months, we may even witness a continuous evolution and transformation of some of the malware families that we have come across so far. In fact, some types of malware that were never traditionally used for mining will now be used for this purpose both directly and indirectly. Additionally, cybercriminals will now be using adware and spyware on a large scale to drive users to mining pages, get access to local cryptocurrency accounts, and gain control over servers to use them as their potential mining pools. What’s more alarming is that even if the malicious cryptocurrency mining domain turns grey, cybercriminals will still continue winning big with spyware and adware, which they will use to steal people’s personal and financial information and intellectual property.', '\'Coinbase\', \'cryptocurrency\', \'Cryptomining\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/malware-cryptocurrency-miners/');

2019.\nThe next few months are considered to be a pivotal period for defining what this relationship will look like and of as of right now there are many unknowns, including implications for the U.K.’s cyber assurance capability.\nThere are broadly three domains across cybersecurity that could be impacted by the character of the agreements struck: Skills access, legal matters and threat intel sharing.\nIt is sensible for security leaders in U.K. -headquartered businesses to start thinking about the potential impacts and considering plans to mitigate.  The below is not an exhaustive exploration, just some initial food for thought.\n\n\nSkills Access\nIt is presently estimated that 13% of the world’s cybersecurity skills resides in the U.K., which is the most of any EU nation.  However, the present is not necessarily a great place to be.  Recent research carried about by Indeed.com tells us that in the U.K. there is just one candidate for every three cybersecurity job vacancies.  This is the second worst applications ratio in the world.  This is not an indicator that the U.K. lags in cybersecurity talent per capita.  Rather it is a reflection of the demand for cybersecurity personnel, which is itself driven by the importance of IT to the U.K.’s service-led economy.\nSkilled migrants have a long-established role in topping up U.K. business requirements generally.  A final deal with the EU that disrupts our ability to easily import part of our cyber-defender workforce without work visas may widen this gap somewhat.  The thorn in the side of this matter is that the U.K. government is highly committed to reducing net migration, so it has not so far positioned loosening caps from countries outside of the EU for highly skilled and in-demand workers like Cyber Security Analysts.\n [You might also like: GDPR in Action, Even Facebook Impacted]\nInterestingly, recent conversations with Heads of Security suggest there is already a significant reduction in the number of applications from candidates from typically strong non-U.K. EU locations.  They speculate the primary reasons as being the relative drop in the value of the pound and general unease about what their rights may be from 2019 onwards.\nGiven the risk posed by Brexit of further intensifying an already sizeable skills gap, the security leaders of U.K. businesses should be considering further means to reduce workforce requirements.  Automation and managed services arrangements are sound places to start.\nLegal Matters\nThe U.K. government has emphatically embraced all of the EU’s data protection standards, including GDPR.  GDPR in particular was considered by government mandarins to be the teeth that was missing from the U.K.’s cyber essentials scheme, benefiting citizens who have had their personal data stolen hand over fist.\nIt is hard to imagine an EU departure scenario whereby the U.K. government gets behind a roll back from these regulations and necessary enforcement.  Doing so would simply kill the ability for the U.K. services sector to reach European consumers.  It would also anger the general public whom have gratefully received the

and prosecutions.  The primary reason that cybercrime is so rife across eastern countries is that hackers attack western victims and exploit the complexities of international investigations, prosecution and extradition.  Whilst the U.K. has extremely capable agencies, at present it has access to a number of EU-operated law enforcement tools that we may not retain after Brexit.  To name just two, the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) for capturing criminals evading justice across countries and Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).\nOf these two examples, retained access to Europol has been a particularly contentious matter to date – perhaps not surprising given the agency states their primary goal as “helping achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens.”  U.K. headquartered businesses that have cross-EU-based operations would therefore be very sensible to commence establishing how they can continue to collaborate with EC3 through local arrangements in the result of a Brexit arrangement excluding the U.K. per se.\n [You might also like: Cloud vs DDoS, the Seven Layers of Complexity]\nThreat Intel Sharing\nFrom the candidates at risk of reduced capability following a highly diverged relationship, the most significant may perhaps be around reducing our access to shared threat intel.\nWhilst the U.K. has its own extremely powerful agencies gathering threat intel on nation-state and serious cybercriminal threats (GCHQ, NSCS) there are many other sources that are EU projects.  They include the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security’s (Enisa’s) Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT) Network and Network and Information Security (NIS) Cooperation Group, plus also Europol.\nThe U.K. could retain access to these resources on a global basis if the topic of contributing to EU budgets is depoliticized, but as of right now the U.K. has never faced a more political topic than Brexit!\nOn a national security level the U.K. risks a net reduction in situational awareness against major cyber threats.  It could be said we could cover the gaps over time.  However, TI works best when the administrative costs to gather the data is minimized and there is no better way to minimize costs than to share them!\nThe above said, U.K. -headquartered businesses with cross-EU-based offices that have enjoyed the benefit of intel feeds from some of the above mentioned agencies could continue to do so through local office liaison. Plus of course increasing their involvement with organizations like the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), who have significant TI on Europe-wide threats.\nIn summing up, despite its strategic significance to both the U.K. (and also the EU of course), the cybersecurity dimension of Brexit has received very limited exposure in the press and media to date.  As well as starting to think about what Brexit could mean for their businesses, it is the task of British cybersecurity leaders to elevate the topic to the general public and (for the brave!) politicians.  Doing so is the only way to ensure that the security of our online digital economy and society is not diminished.', '\'Brexit\', \'EU\', \'GDPR\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/uk-cybersecurity-post-brexit/');

Stanford University conducted different studies which showed that approximately 15% of users will abort their web visit if they are faced with a CAPTCHA challenge.\n [You might also like: CAPTCHA Limitations of Bot Mitigation]\nIf we also have a look into when this challenge comes, we see that it’s late in the process.\nUsually we can access the website, then browse some pages and usually it’s either on registration or login pages you will have this challenge.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nSo instead of blocking only bad bots, you may have false positives seeing clients going to competitors due to CAPTCHA.\nIn case CAPTCHA is based on source IP, there is another risk. When you surf on the internet, you go out with a single public IP. In case your network is a corporate one and you have multiple devices, they will share the same public IP. So, if one device answers the CAPTCHA, all devices will be allowed as they come from the same IP.\nOvercoming the limitation with fingerprint technology\nAs we know that nothing is better than transparent solutions, we see lot of “new” solutions in airports (fingerprint verification, retinal controls), highways (ETC for Electronic Toll Collection), and more.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\nWhen we have to stand in line wasting precious minutes, we always think that next time we’ll use a faster mechanism.\nWhy would you think differently for your application protection?\nOne of the advanced protections is to identify a client based on a fingerprint instead of any “classic” information available by default in HTTP requests. This fingerprint will be generated on the first request, allowing these security solutions to detect and mitigate bad bots at the very first step of web browsing.\nUnlike some CAPTCHA based on IP, fingerprints will be unique and linked to the client’s machine. So even if multiple clients come from the same public IP, they will be identified as different clients.\nOf course, we can still act badly after sending our fingerprint. In case we do so, this fingerprint can be used to mitigate our attacks and later block our access to the website due to too many attacks. This subject will be covered in an upcoming article: Access to applications based on a “driving license” model.', '\'captcha\', \'device fingerprinting\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/security-fingerprinting-vs-captcha/');

If forward-thinking organizations are using security as a competitive differentiator to build loyalty with customers, how are executives expected to accomplish this facing new security threats, tight budgets, a shortfall in cybersecurity professionals, and the need to safeguard increasingly diversified infrastructures?\n\nThe foundation of the customer experience is a mix of trust and availability. Organizationsâ brands take a hit if either factor falters and C-suite executives are keenly aware of this. According to Radwareâs newly published report, C-Suite Perspectives: Trends in the Cyberattack Landscape, Security Threats and Business Impacts, executives ranked the top three impacts of a successful cyberattack/data breach on their business.\n\nThat damage also extends directly into the organizationâs P&L statement. Over 40% of respondents estimated the cost of a single cyberattack to be greater than $1 million USD/EUR. Moreover, todayâs consumers donât just expect organizations to keep their data secure, theyâre willing to retaliate when itâs compromised. Our research shows that 41% of executives report that customers took legal action against their company following a data breach.\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity & The Customer Experience: The Perfect Combination]\nWhatâs An Executive To Do? \nThe key is creating a secure climate for customers by embracing technology and change. Corporationsâ networks are the lynchpin of interactions with customers who expect responsive apps, fast performance, and above all, protection of their data.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nTo create this climate, our research shows executives must be willing to accept new technologies, be open-minded to new ideologies and embrace change. First is balancing the investment versus risk equation. Any executive will face tough choices when deciding where to invest resources to propel their company forward. As the threat of cyberattacks becomes a question of when, not if, C-suite executives must leverage the aforementioned data points and carefully evaluate the risks associated with security vulnerabilities and the costs of implementing effective security solutions. As identified in the same report, 4 in 10 respondents identify increasing infrastructure complexity, digital transformation plans, and integration of artificial intelligence as putting pressure on security planning and budget allocation.\nMoreover, migrating to the cloud increases security risks, as security gaps between heterogeneous systems represent the gaps that cyber assailants look to exploit. Executives understand that dispersing their networks across multiple public and private clouds introduces security risks. More than 90% of respondents reported using multiple public and private cloud environments, with the vast majority indicating theyâre concerned about the security vulnerabilities that a heterogeneous infrastructure introduces.\n\n [You might also like: Why Cyber-Security Is Critical to The Loyalty of Your Most Valued Customers]\nAs demand for security professionals outpaces supply and attackers become increasingly sophisticated, C-suite leaders must embrace the integration of new technologies and talent. Our research clearly shows that executives know their organizations are vulnerable, but are ready to embrace automation and outside expertise to safeguard their corporate and customer data, and thus, the customer experience. Executives must not be anxious about relying on ex-hackers, ISPs or their organizationâs DDoS mitigation vendor as vital sources of knowledge and thought leadership to stay abreast of todayâs threat landscape and mitigation best practices. For example, over half of executives now prefer to rely on their ISP/CSP to manage security, a 20 percent increase since 2017.\n\nThe stakes are high. Security threats can seriously impact a companyâs brand reputation, resulting in customer loss, reduced operational productivity and lawsuits. C-suite executives recognize the multiple pressures on their organizations to integrate new network technologies, transform their businesses and to defend against cyberattacks. Those executives that are willing to embrace technology and change and prioritize cybersecurity will be the ones to win the trust and loyalty of the 21st century consumer.', '\'c-suite\', \'Cloud\', \'customer experience\', \'Customer Loyalty\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/2018-c-suite/');

These factors will define the criteria for selecting the optimal solution.\n\n\nBelow are eight questions to ask when considering DDoS protection:\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n\nWhat are my data center plans? Many organizations are migrating their data center workloads to cloud-based deployments. The decision of whether to invest in new equipment or to use to a cloud service depends heavily on this consideration. Organizations that are planning to downscale (or completely eliminate) their data centers might consider a cloud service. However, if you know for sure that you are planning to maintain your physical data center for the foreseeable future, then investing in a DDoS mitigation appliance could be worthwhile.\nWhat is my threat profile? Which protection model is best for you also depends heavily on the company’s threat profile. If a company is constantly attacked with a stream of non-volumetric DDoS attacks, then a premise-based solution might be an effective solution. However, if they face large-scale volumetric attacks, then a cloud-based or a hybrid solution would be better.\nAre my applications mission-critical? Some DDoS protection models offer faster response (and protection) time than others. Most applications can absorb short periods of interruption without causing major harm. However, if your service cannot afford even a moment of downtime, that should factor heavily into the decision-making process.\nHow sensitive are my applications to latency? Another key consideration is the sensitivity of the organization and its applications to latency. Cloud-based services tend to add latency to application traffic, so if latency is a big issue, then an on-premise solution – either deployed inline or out-of-path – might be relevant.\nAm I in a regulated industry? Some organizations are within regulated industries that handle sensitive user data. As a result, they’re prevented from – or prefer not to – migrate services/data to the cloud.\nHow important is control for me? Some organizations place a big emphasis on control, while others prefer that others handle the burden. A physical device will provide you with more control, but will also require additional overhead. Others, however, might prefer the lower overhead usually offered by cloud services.\nOPEX vs. CAPEX? Solutions which include hardware devices (such as a premise-based DDoS appliance) are usually accounted for as a capital expenditure (CAPEX), whereas ongoing subscription services (such as cloud DDoS protection services) are considered operating expenses (OPEX). Depending on accounting and procurement processes, some organizations may have a preference for one type over the other.\nWhat is my budget? Finally, when selecting a DDoS protection solution, many times the decision comes down to costs and available funds. That’s why it is important to be cognizant of the total cost of ownership (TCO), including added overhead, infrastructure, support, staff and training.\n\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution – Part I: On-Prem Appliance]\nDepending on the answers to those questions, organizations can define the criteria for what’s important for them in a DDoS solutions, and base their choice based on that.\n\nTypically, for organizations seeking data center protection, or have mission critical and latency-sensitive applications they need to protect, a hybrid solution will provide optimal protection.\n\nHybrid DDoS protection combines both premise-based and cloud-based components. It provides both low latency and uninterrupted protection, as well as the high capacity required to mitigate large-scale volumetric DDoS attacks.\n\nFor organizations looking to protect applications hosted on public cloud providers (such as AWS or Azure), or customers who frequently come under attack, an cloud-based always-on solution will usually be best.\n\nAlways-On cloud service provides constant, uninterrupted cloud-based DDoS protection. However, since all traffic is routed through the provider’s scrubbing network, it may add latency to requests.\n\nFinally, for customers who are infrequently attacked, or otherwise have a limited budget, a cloud-based on-demand solution will usually suffice.\n\nOn-Demand cloud service is activated only when organizations come under DDoS attack. However, detection and diversion usually take longer than in other models, meaning that the customer may be exposed for longer periods.\nThe parameters of the optimal DDoS solution will inevitably vary from organization to organization.

Throughout the world, nearly daily news reports have been filed detailing the results of incredibly effective cyberattacks ranging from small companies to nation-states. The sum total of these attacks has permanently and dramatically changed the information security threat landscape.  This change hasn’t gone unnoticed with the regulators and now, depending on where your business operates, you have accrued even more work to demonstrate your diligence to these threats.\n\nAmong the numerous lessons drawn from this carnage is that cyberattacks have become an existential threat to many countries as the attacks, on financial services to power generation facilities, threaten the fidelity and integrity of numerous industrial segments. As a result, regulators throughout the world are stepping in to try and drive meaningful action where they believe it is required.  Normally these early efforts are the harbingers of future legislation and give birth to standard approaches and forums to debate the efficacy in approaches.\n\nSince 2014 there have been 10 noteworthy efforts:\n\nEffort#1: National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework (U.S.)\nEffort#2: Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) Memorandum (Canada)\nEffort #3: Federal Financial Institution’s Examiner Council (FFIEC) Joint Statement on DDoS Cyber Attacks, Risk Mitigation and Additional Resources (U.S.)\nEffort #4: Securities & Exchange Commission Cyber Exams (U.S.)\nEffort #5: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Guidance (U.S.)\nEffort #6: National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Risk Alert (U.S.)\nEffort #7: EU’s NIS Directive (EU)\nEffort #8: EU’s GDPR (EU)\nEffort #9: EU’s Regulation Against Geo-IP-based blocking of EU member countries or economies (EU)\nEffort #10: Growth of Country Specific Cybersecurity Laws such as Korean Cyber Laws (KOREA)\n\nEach of these efforts has taken different approaches but seem to have similar ethos.  Let’s explore each in a little more depth:\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework\nIn response to a presidential directive, on Oct.22nd the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released the latest version of its cybersecurity framework which aims to better secure U.S. companies and government agencies. The new draft goes into significantly greater detail than the version released Aug. 28th, which laid out higher level principles of the framework, including items referred to as ‘pillars.’ The NIST laid out three central pillars to the framework which are designed to provide industry and government alike with common cybersecurity taxonomy, establish goals, intended targets, identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement, assess progress and improve communication among stakeholders. The final framework was announced in February of 2014. Many thought this framework was viewed as the seed which would spawn numerous industrial requirements throughout the U.S.\n [You might also like: GDPR in Action, Even Facebook Impacted]\nOffice of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OFSI) DDoS Memorandum\nEarlier this year, large Canadian-based banks were hit by cyberattacks whereby one or more hackers used a brute force “denial-of-service” attack to disable some bank’s websites and mobile applications. Attacks such as these were reminiscent of Operation Ababil, which began in September 2012 and focused on attacking the websites of large U.S.-based banks. Those attacks were similar to the Canadian attacks and slowed down website operations and caused many bank sites to be inoperative for a significant portion of their customers. Mindful of this very real threat and the need to manage risk, on October 28, 2013, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) released a memorandum to federally-regulated Canadian financial institutions (FRFIs) discussing the measures that FRFIs should be taking to prevent, manage and remediate cyberattacks. The memorandum states that cybersecurity is growing in importance because: (i) FRFIs increasingly rely on technology; (ii) the financial sector is interconnected; and (iii) FRFIs play a critical role in our economy. As part of this memorandum, OSFI has required all FRFIs to conduct a self-assessment of the risks and take actions against those risks. OSFI also will be reviewing the fidelity of the assessment and the corresponding risk mitigation steps.\nBack in 2005, the OSFI established the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre (CCIRC) with a mandate to collaborate with the private sector in responding to the threat of cyberattack.\nLast year, however, a report from the country’s auditor general showed that the government had made only limited progress, with gaps in protection, especially at the CCIRC which at the time was only open during business hours, limiting its ability to provide timely information for stakeholders. OSFI suggests in its cybersecurity self-assessment that financial firms should work with the CCIRC, which had its hours extended.\nFFIEC Joint Statement: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Cyber-Attacks, Risk Mitigation, and Additional Resources (US)\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) members are issuing statements to notify financial institutions of the risks associated with cyberattacks on Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and card authorization systems and the continued distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on public-facing websites. The statements describe steps the members could expect institutions to take to address these attacks and highlight resources institutions can use to help mitigate the risks posed by such attacks.\nThe members also expect financial institutions to address DDoS readiness as part of their ongoing information security and incident plans. More specifically, each institution is expected to monitor incoming traffic to its public website, activate incident response plans if it suspects that a DDoS attack is occurring, and ensure sufficient staffing for the duration of the attack, including the use of pre-contracted third-party servicers, if appropriate.\nSpecifically, the FFIEC is guiding its members to do the following:\n\nMaintain an ongoing program to assess information security risks that identifies, prioritizes, and assesses the risk to critical systems, including threats to external websites and online accounts;\nMonitor internet traffic to the institution’s website to detect attacks;\nActivate incident response plans and notify service providers, including internet service providers (ISPs), as appropriate, if the institution suspects that a DDoS attack is occurring. Response plans should include appropriate communication strategies with customers concerning the safety of their accounts;\nEnsure sufficient staffing for the duration of the DDoS attack and consider hiring pre-contracted third-party servicers, as appropriate, that can assist in managing the internet-based traffic flow. Identify how the institution’s ISP can assist in responding to and mitigating an attack;\nConsider sharing information with organizations, such as the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and law enforcement because attacks can change rapidly, and sharing the information can help institutions to identify and mitigate new threats and tactics; and\nEvaluate any gaps in the institution’s response following attacks and in its ongoing risk assessments, and adjust risk management controls accordingly.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Cyber Exams (U.S.)\nThe SEC announced inaugural exams of member companies along with a list of questions they will use.\nIf you are not aware, the SEC governs most of the financial services which do not fall under the FFIEC jurisdiction. So, all mutual funds, wealth management and hedge funds (among many others) are regulated NOT by FFIEC guidelines, but rather SEC guidelines. Unlike the FFIEC and their regulatory arms (OCC, FDIC, OTS, & NCUA), up to this point the SEC did conduct ad-hoc reviews, however routine security reviews were maintained.\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency Guidance (U.S.)\nIn December 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) notified it’s member financial institutions that DDoS attacks are on the rise and that they expect their members to take steps to identify the risks associated with the attacks and to provide notification to the OCC and others if they are under attack.  The guidance reads as follows:\n“Recently, various sophisticated groups launched distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks directed at national banks and federal savings associations (collectively, banks). Each of the groups had different objectives for conducting these attacks ranging from garnering public attention to diverting bank resources while simultaneous online attacks were under way and intended to enable fraud or steal proprietary information. This alert provides a general description of the attacks, along with risk mitigation information and sources of related risk management guidance. The alert also reiterates the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) expectations that banks should have risk management programs to identify and appropriately consider new and evolving threats to online accounts and to adjust their customer authentication, layered security, and other controls as appropriate in response to changing levels of risk.\nThe OCC expects banks that are victims of or adversely affected by a DDoS attack to report this information to law enforcement authorities and to notify their supervisory office. Additionally, banks should voluntarily file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) if the DDoS attack affects critical information of the institution including customer account information, or damages, disables or otherwise affects critical systems of the bank.”\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity & The Customer Experience: The Perfect Combination]\nNational Credit Union Administration Risk Alert (U.S.)\nIn February, 2013, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) issued a Risk Alert to member credit union institutions on “Mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks.”   The alert included the following verbiage:\n“The increasing frequency of cyber-terror attacks on depository institutions heightens the need for credit unions to maintain strong information security protocols. Recent incidents have included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which cause internet-based service outages by overloading network bandwidth or system resources. DDoS attacks do not directly attempt to steal funds or sensitive personal information, but they may be coupled with such attempts to distract attention and/or disable alerting systems.”\nClearly the sense of urgency and ferocity of the attacks came through in the alert and provided for an understanding of the issues being broader than the availability of credit union systems.\nNo one can say for certain how all of this will play out, however given the increased frequency, directed attacks, and effectiveness of the techniques, we can safely assume that regulators and government legislators will take head from public calls-to-action and will continue to drive prescriptive steps for all relevant organizations to follow.\nEuropean Union Security of Network Information Systems (NIS) Directive 2016/ 2018\nIn July 2016, the European Parliament set into policy the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS Directive).\nThe directive went into effect in August 2016, and all member states of the European Union were given 21 months to incorporate the directive’s regulations into their own national laws.  The aim of the NIS Directive is to create an overall higher level of cybersecurity in the EU. The directive significantly affects digital service providers (DSPs) and operators of essential services (OESs). Operators of essential services include any organizations whose operations would be greatly affected in the case of a security breach if they engage in critical societal or economic activities. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting major security incidents to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT). While DSPs are not held to as stringent regulations as operators of essential services, DSPs that are not set up in the EU but still operate in the EU still face regulations. Even if DSPs and OES outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents.\nThe member states of the EU are required to create a NIS directive strategy, which includes the CSIRTs, in addition to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Such resources are given the responsibility of handling cybersecurity breaches in a way that minimizes impact. In addition, all member states of the EU are encouraged to share cyber security information.[23]\nSecurity requirements include technical measures that manage the risks of cybersecurity breaches in a preventative manner. Both DSP and OES must provide information that allows for an in-depth assessment of their information systems and security policies. All significant incidents must be notified to the CSIRTs. Significant cybersecurity incidents are determined by the number of users affected by the security breach as well as the longevity of the incident and the geographical reach of the incident.\nEuropean Union General Protection Regulation (GDPR) \nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25th, 2018. The GDPR aims to bring a single standard for data protection among all member states in the EU. Changes include the redefining of geographical borders. It applies to entities that operate in the EU or deal with the data of any resident of the EU. Regardless of where the data is processed, if an EU citizen’s data is being processed, the entity is now subject to the GDPR.\nFines are also much more stringent under the GDPR and can total €20 million euros or 4% of an entity’s annual turnover, whichever is higher. In addition, like in previous regulations, all data breaches that effect the rights and freedoms of individuals residing in the EU must be disclosed within 72 hours.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nThe overarching board, the EU Data Protection Board, EDP, is in charge of all oversight set by the GDPR.\nConsent plays a major role in the GDPR. Companies that hold data in regards to EU citizens must now also offer to them the right to back out of sharing data just as easily as when they consented to sharing data.\nIn addition, citizens can also restrict processing of the data stored on them and can choose to allow companies to store their data but not process it, which creates a clear differentiation. Unlike previous regulations, the GDPR also restricts the transfer of a citizen’s data outside of the EU or to a third party without a citizen’s prior consent.\nWhat Does It Mean for Online Business and Cloud Service Providers?\nFor online businesses and cloud service providers, GDPR compliance means adherence to the principles of “Privacy by Design” and “Data Protection by Design” during the design, development, implementation and deployment of web applications or services and any components or services associated with them. With the rapid adoption of cloud services, there is a heightened concern with regard to the readiness of these applications and services. A recent study conducted by Symantec/Bluecoat shows that 98% of today’s cloud applications do not even come close to being GDPR-ready.\n [You might also like: GDPR and HITECH: Can the past predict the future?]\nWAF, DDoS and the GDPR\nBased on recital 39 of the GDPR, personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality, including preventing unauthorized access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. Recital 49 goes further by requiring the ability of a network or an information system to resist accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems. The recital literally says “This could, for example, include preventing unauthorized access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems.” This would include brute force login attempts and automated mitigation techniques outlined in the OWASP Top 10 requirement for PCI compliance.\nMost businesses will face the urgent need for increasing protection on published applications and services on all topics and purposes of data leak prevention, access control, web-based attack prevention and denial of service prevention. Leading providers of cloud and on-premise web application and API protection services as well as on-demand, always-on cloud and hybrid denial of service mitigation services do provide an adequate solution for this acute need. A fully managed WAF and DDoS Cloud service provides a fast route to check off one of the regulatory compliance boxes and a worry-free GDPR compliance strategy.\nEuropean Union Ban on Geo-IP Blocking of Member States 2018\nIn February 2018, The European Council adopted a regulation to ban unjustified geo-blocking in the internal market. The European Council has emphasized repeatedly the importance of the digital single market strategy and called for the speeding up of the implementation of the strategy, which includes the removal of remaining barriers to the free circulation of goods and services sold online and for tackling unjustified discrimination on the grounds of geographic location.\nEU declared geo-blocking as a discriminatory practice that prevents online customers from accessing and purchasing products or services from a website based in another member state.\nThe new law will remove barriers to e-commerce by avoiding discrimination based on customers’ nationality, place of residence or place of establishment.\nThe end of geo-blocking of internet addresses of EU countries will significantly disrupt many mainline cyber defense strategies of many companies and countries. Moreover, this new complication is not well understood and alternatives are not always easy to implement.\nThe EU regulation goes into full effect in December 2018.\nPayment transactions whereby: \nUnjustified discrimination of customers in relation to payment methods will be forbidden. Therefore, traders will not be allowed to apply different payment conditions for customers for reasons of nationality, place of residence or place of establishment.\nNon-discrimination for e-commerce website access whereby:\nTraders will not be allowed to block or limit customers’ access to their online interface for reasons of nationality or place of residence.  A clear explanation will have to be provided if a trader blocks or limits access or redirects customers to a different version of the online interface.\nOn the positive side, the EU believes that the end of geo-blocking will mean wider choice and consequently better deals for consumers and more opportunities for businesses.\nGrowth of Country-Specific Cybersecurity Regulations such as Korean Cyber Laws\nIn Korea, there are various laws, regulations and guidelines that promote cybersecurity: two general laws (the Network Act and the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)) and other laws targeting specific areas, as discussed below.\nThe Act on the Promotion of IT Network Use and Information Protection (the Network Act) plays an important part in promoting cybersecurity in terms of protecting personal information and enhancing data security in the context of IT networks. The Network Act also prohibits any unauthorized access to a network system by means of a transfer or distribution of a program that may damage, destroy, alter or corrupt the network system, or its data or programs.  Under the Network Act it is prohibited to cause disruption of a ICN by intentionally disturbing network operations with large volumes of signal / data or superfluous requests.  Any violation shall be subject to imprisonment of not more than five years or a penalty of not more than KRW 50 Million.\nThere are additional targeted statutes, such as the Electronic Financial Transactions Act (EFTA), which includes provisions prohibiting electronic intrusion into the network systems of financial companies, and data protection is mandated for financial companies in the Regulation on Supervision of Electronic Financial Activities (the RSEFA), which is an administrative regulation subordinate to the EFTA.  Under the EFTA, any attacks on financial systems using programs such as viruses, logic or email bombs, with the intention of destroying or disrupting financial systems shall be subject to imprisonment of not more than 10 years or a penalty of not more than KRW 100 Million.\nIn contrast with the laws mentioned above, which are more focused on the protection of data, the Protection of Information and Communications Infrastructure Act (PICIA) is more engaged with the protection of information and communications infrastructure against ‘electronic intrusion’, which is defined as an act of attacking information and communications infrastructure by hacking, computer viruses, logic bombs, email bombs, denial of service, high-power electromagnetic waves and other means.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'GDPR\', \'legislation\', \'regulations\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/06/cybersecurity-laws-regulations-directives-standards/');

The hackers took their time, poking here, prodding there, until they had a pretty good idea of the shape of things.\n\nThe company recognized their incumbent security solution had shortcomings and had first installed our intelligent software in passive mode. When we warned executives of an incoming attack, they first did not believe us because their security system wasn’t detecting anything. But eventually, they asked us to take a closer look.\n\nSure enough, a couple weeks after the probes ended, hackers launched a sophisticated, multi-vector attack that displayed significant knowledge of the financial institution’s network and weaknesses. We were able to quickly thwart them, without any impact to the business.\nThe reason I’m telling you this story is because this organization’s security flaws stemmed from a common habit that organizations of all sizes need to break. Like this financial institution, businesses all too often rely on disparate systems that cannot communicate to protect the private cloud, the public cloud, and the data center, not knowing that hackers can exploit the environments’ differences to gain access to all three. The sum of the parts is too often less than the whole.\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution – Part IV: Hybrid Protection]\nIn cybersecurity, we face bad actors who learn and evolve. They get better, smarter. When it comes to hybrid cloud security, the surface areas for attacks grow and valuable data traverses multiple different locations, sometimes simultaneously.

A few years and a couple satellite offices later, the company decides to move some applications onto a private cloud to accommodate the geography of its workforce. A few years after that, it moves other applications to a public cloud service to stay ahead of traffic surges, lower costs, and add agility.\nAt each stage, the network administrator establishes security protocols for the new environment based on the new architecture. But many network administrators never go back and adjust the data center’s security in light of the new private cloud, and the protocols are seldom adjusted when the second cloud is added.\nThere are lots of reasons for this. Budget plays a role. A planned cloud adoption might have a budget for security that only factors in the new environment. Or the administrator might believe that, having checked for hardware and policy compatibility between the new environments, the security policies are aligned, and there’s no need and no time to go back.\nThis isn’t and shouldn’t be the case.\nSecurity gaps increase exponentially when adding new infrastructure. Security holes in the data center interact with holes in the public cloud and with those in the private cloud and vice-versa. Each environment is insecure in its own unique way.\n [You might also like: Cloud vs DDoS, the Seven Layers of Complexity]\nTo counter this, network administrators and CIOs need to bring their entire network under a single security blanket, a collection of network devices that communicate with each other across clouds and data centers to create a common baseline for security for rapid and accurate protection. Even if one part of the network is attacked, the other parts know about it and prepare defenses.\nThat single blanket should rely heavily on automation; there’s a global shortage of cybersecurity talent. It’s a hard discipline to learn, even harder to attract top talent and many companies are reluctant to hire individuals who learned as teens, dabbling in the cyber dark side. Automated systems can learn to coordinate detection and attack responses across an entire network without any manual intervention.\nTake into account the robustness of the threat environment as well. DDoS attacks affect one part of your network, application attacks another, encrypted attacks a third. A single application in the cloud can have different security needs on-premise.\nBut treating security concerns holistically solves these problems. So whether you’re currently migrating applications or data to the cloud or you’ve been using multiple clouds for years, take the time to revisit and revise your security policies and make yourself a much tougher target because you are already in the hackers’ crosshairs you just may not know it.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud Security\', \'Hybrid Cloud\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/05/hybrid-cloud-security/');

However, Radware research shows that DDoS attacks are not just getting bigger; theyâre also getting more sophisticated. Hackers are constantly coming up with new and innovative ways of bypassing traditional DDoS defenses and compromise organizationsâ service availability.\n\nOnline security providers are similarly stepping up their game, coming up with new technologies to hold-off attackers. However, not all DDoS protections are created equal.Â  DDoS protection services vary greatly in terms of quality and protections offered.\nIn order to make sure you are protected against the latest and most potent DDoS attacks, you need to make sure that your security provider offers the right tools and technologies to deal with the latest threats.\n\nHere are five must-have capabilities that you need for modern DDoS protection:\nMust-Have #1: Application-Layer DDoS Protection\nApplication-layer (L7) DDoS attacks have overtaken network-layer (L3/4) attacks as the most widespread attack vectors. According to Radwareâs 2017-2018 ERT Report, 64% of organizations faced application-layer attacks, compared to only 51% who faced network-layer attacks.\nIn fact, according to the ERT Report, HTTP floods were the #1 attack vector across all attack types (both network-layer and application-layer). In addition, SSL, DNS and SMTP attacks were other common types of application-layer attack.\nMany online security services promise L7 DDoS protection through their WAF. However, this usually requires subscribing to pricey add-on WAF services, on-top of DDoS protection mechanisms.\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution â Part I: On-Prem Appliance]\nThe implication of these trends is that modern DDoS protection, it is no longer enough to be protected only against network-layer DDoS attacks. Modern DDoS protection must include built-in defense against application-layer (L7) attacks in order for organizations to be fully protected.\nMust-Have #2: SSL DDoS Flood Protection\nEncrypted traffic now accounts for the majority of internet traffic. According to Mozillaâs Letâs Encrypt project, over 70% of web sites globally are delivered over HTTPS, with some markets such as the US and Germany achieving ever higher rates.Â  These findings are reflected by Radwareâs latest ERT Report, with 96% of businesses now using SSL to some extent, and 60% attesting that the majority of their traffic is encrypted.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nThis rise, however, also creates significant security challenges: an encrypted request can require up to 15 times more server resources than a regular request. This means that sophisticated attackers can cripple a website even with a small amount of traffic.\nAs more and more traffic becomes encrypted, SSL DDoS floods are becoming an increasingly popular attack vector for hackers. According to Radwareâs latest ERT report, 30% of businesses reported suffering an SSL-based attack in the previous 12 months.\nDue to the potency of SSL-based DDoS attacks, high-level protection against SSL DDoS floods is a must-have for organizations who want to be fully protected.\nMust-Have #3: Zero-Day Protection\nAttackers are constantly finding new ways of bypassing traditional security mechanisms and hitting organizations with attack methods never seen before. Even by making small changes to attack signatures hackers can craft attacks that are not recognized by manual signatures. Such attacks are commonly known as âzero-dayâ attacks.\nFor example, one common type of zero-day attack is a burst DDoS attack, which use short bursts of high-volume attacks before switching to a different attack vector. These assaults usually combine many different attack vectors, leaving organizations that rely on traditional, manually-tuned, security solutions floundering in the wake of these hit-and-run tactics.\nAnother type of zero-day attack is an amplification attack. Amplification attacks usually employ communication protocols where there is large asymmetry between request and response packet sizes. Such attacks bounce traffic off 3rd-party servers not involved in the attack, amplifying the amount of traffic and overwhelming the target.\nAccording to Radwareâs 2017-2018 ERT Report, 42% of organizations have been hit by a burst attack, and 40% reported experiencing an amplification DDoS attack. These trends illustrate the need for zero-day protection capabilities in modern DDoS protection mechanisms.\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution â Part II: On-Demand Cloud Service]\nMust-Have #4: Behavioral Protection\nAs DDoS attacks become more sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. This is particularly true for application-layer (L7) DDoS attacks, which mimic legitimate user behavior.\nOne common mechanism by many security vendors is to detect attacks based on traffic volume thresholds, and use rate-limiting to cap spikes in traffic. However, this is a very crude way of blocking attacks, since it does not distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.Â  This is particularly a problem during times of activity spikes â such as shopping holidays â when there is a significant increase in traffic. Unsophisticated protection mechanisms such as rate-limiting will not distinguish between legitimate and attack traffic, and end up blocking valid users.\nA much more effective method of detecting and blocking attacks, however, is using behavioral technologies that learn what constitutes normal user behavior, and block all traffic that does not conform to this behavior. Not only does this provide a higher level of protection, but will also result in fewer false-positives and will not block legitimate users in times of peak traffic.\nTherefore, using DDoS protection based on behavioral detection (and mitigation) is a must-have for effective DDoS protection.\nMust-Have #5: Detailed SLA\nYour Service Level Agreement (SLA) is you contractual guarantee to what your security provider is committed to give you.Â  It is no exaggeration to say that your security is only as good as your SLA.\nMany security vendors make expansive marketing claims about their capabilities, but their claims vaporize into thin air once it comes to making actual commitments to these claims.\nTo make sure that what the brochure says is also what you get â you need to tell your security vendor to put their money where their mouth is, and provide a detailed SLA, with specific commitments to detection, mitigation and availability metrics. The SLA should cover the entire DDoS attack lifecycle, to make sure youâre fully covered against every scenario.\nFailure by your security provider to provide such commitments should cast doubt on your vendorâs ability to provide high-quality protection against DDoS attacks. This is why a granular SLA is a must-have for modern DDoS protection.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/05/5-capabilities-ddos-protection/');

It’s disappointing, but it’s true. Innovatively-designed malware and APTs have the potential to evade even the strongest signature-based security solutions that are currently being deployed across industries. This has encouraged IT companies to think beyond prevention and to design effective detection strategies. In recent times, companies have started analyzing traffic logs through a deployment of technology as well as professional services to detect attacks that are under way. However, even though traffic log analysis can promote the identification of malware activity, companies may not benefit from it much as the on-premises approach is incomplete, inefficient, and expensive at the same time.\n\n\nFortunately, the industry has started capitalizing on the capabilities of the cloud to conduct traffic log analysis in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

Big Data analytics and statistical analysis promote the creation of malware profiles and adoption of machine learning algorithms that, in turn, support traffic log analysis.\n [You might also like: SIP Protection: What Your SIP Security Solution Should Have]\nSo how does Traffic Log Analysis work?\nOne option is to offer Traffic Log Analysis, as for the following process:\nThe traffic logs are processed by machine learning algorithms and if suspicious traffic gets identified, they are segregated into a channel. Analysis of the channel’s features is conducted, taking into consideration the profiles of the user, company, industry, and the region as a whole. Following the detection of malware, the user is updated immediately through the Protection API and the dashboard, which immediately send out a signal to the firewalls and proxies to block the threats. The service may also choose to analyze historical traffic log files to detect the initial point of infection. Additionally, the malware is downloaded to a sandbox environment for next-level review. If the malware falls in the botnet category, the data is transferred to a sort of Botnet Interception Module, which tracks traffic and detects compromised users and IP addresses.\nEnsuring Privacy of Users’ Data\nIt’s extremely important to safeguard users’ confidential log data during transit and when it is stored. As the malware-induced threat environment continues to become complex and complicated, keeping user data safe becomes really challenging.

The latest Consumer Loss Barometer[2] found that one out of every four consumers would switch banks if the financial institution lacked a solid plan on how to prevent further attacks following a data breach.\nIn financial services, just like other industries, customer data is increasingly spread across heterogeneous environments, devices and networks. Each transaction, each touchpoint, represents a security vulnerability in the customer experience. Security gaps between the underlying systems that manage these touchpoints represent the gaps that cyber assailants exploit. Addressing these vulnerabilities and solidifying a customer’s trust in a banking platform represents an opportunity to win the loyalty of today’s tech-savvy consumer.\nFinancial services is just one example and is at the forefront of addressing these issues.

Demand for these devices is becoming something that we have never seen before as they become incorporated and standardized in the home of the future. Statistics forecast that the global smart home market will grow to around 40.9 Billion in 2020[i] with an estimated 12.86 Billion devices used in the consumer segment[ii]. Should these devices or their supporting networks in the future fail, the consequences could be serious. At the moment we are already seeing these devices targeted for the purpose of launching denial-of-service attacks, mining for cryptocurrencies, click fraud and data theft.\n\nThe problem is the growth of IoT devices and digital technologies continue to evolve at incredible rates but manufactures are failing to produce secure and reliable products. Every day there is a story in the news about how these emerging technologies are abused by cyber criminals and the risks these devices present, yet everyone is still adopting this emerging technology at a rapid rate. So we have to ask ourselves the question, why do we continue to automate our homes with connected devices?\n [You might also like: Smart Homes of Tomorrow â Connect all the things!]\nWhy are people automating their homes?\nMany people automate features in their houses because it solves a need, can be more efficient, helps contribute to life improvements and creates an intelligent ecosystem. Some home buyers are even looking to purchase more connected homes or are looking for homes in an area that provides faster internet connections. Another issue is presented when purchasing a house in the future with smart home equipment already baked in. This results in the possibility of hand-me-down vulnerabilities in anything from entertainment systems and lighting to security products and home appliances. In the same fashion that you would inspect the siding of a house before buying it, the same should be done for the devices installed in a connected home.\nThe top three reasons why a homeowner chooses to incorporate connected devices tend to side with user experience, energy efficiency or home security. But at the same time most users write off the posed security risk due to novelty or disruptiveness of the technology. In short, users want something that will understand their identity, emotions and social life with limited impact and ease of use.\nRisk involved with automation\nGiven the growth in the threat landscape by connecting everything to the internet, architects, designers and owners of connected homes are presented with three core issues: Privacy, vulnerability, and reliability. These issues are often overlooked because the users and those recommending the products do not understand how the technology works or the risks that they expose the user to. They typically have explicit trust for the company making the devices, assuming nothing can go wrong.\nSo what are the risks of living a better, more efficient life through a smart house? Data security, privacy and service availability. In a recent blog by Mike OâMalley, he highlighted seven of the craziest IoT device hacks. These attacks included Cayla, an interactive doll, an aquarium thermometer, a thermostat, a smart TV and a baby monitor, all of which when compromised allowed the hackers to access features such as cameras and microphones, access data or even adjust environmental controls.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nDevices like these are also used to propagate malware, mine for cryptocurrencies and launching denial-of-service attacks. When these IoT devices launch DoS attacks, their bandwidth can be used to target large organizations such as ISPs and hosting providers. When these companies experience outages it can result in a domino effect, causing millions of smart homes to be left in the dark and unable to use home appliances, like turning on a light bulb.\nNot only is your data at risk in the cloud but depending on how a device is configured, it might rely on a cloud infrastructure to operate. In 2017 we had a glimpse into what this might be like in the future when Amazonâs S3 cloud-based storage service went down. Over 100,000 websites went offline, resulting in apps and devices like Nest going down with it.\nIoT devices like a smart light bulb are often paired with a cloud network so that the owners can control their house remotely. To switch on a device, the user makes a call via a hub or an app that then sends a request to the cloud network. The cloud network then responds back with a signal to the light bulb to turn on. If the cloud service is offline, so is your connected device. We also saw this in March 2018 when SmartThings experienced an outage that resulted in U.S. users being unable to log into their app and control their connected devices.\nIn the future as users become more dependent on connected devices, when outages do occur homeowners will be faced with the loss of basic functionalities in their house. Without a manual fallback, homeowners will be left in the dark.\nLike always, hackers go for the lowest hanging fruit, and there appears to be plenty of it to go around at the rate manufactures are shipping vulnerable products.\nConcerns about security and privacy with internet-connected devices should be an important conversation that should begin with the manufacturers. Shipping over privileged devices with weak credentials is one thing, but when they refuse to respond to researchersâ concerns and fail to produce patches for vulnerabilities, they should be held accountable. In fact, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley School of Information suggests that the Mirai attack cost each device $13.50 in bandwidth and energy[iii].\nWhen it comes to privacy, some of these devices being incorporated into smart homes have pairing and discovery protocols that can be abused and forced to leak information about your device and possibly your personal habits. âRemote Home Vulnerabilitiesâ will allow an attacker remote access to internal devices so they can spy on you in an attempt to gain access to personal data or disrupt your environment.Â  With devices continuously recording audio and video while collecting data on the users, it will attract more hackers to invade your privacy. From studying your physical security and device logs for habits, they can successfully hack accounts, allowing adversarial remote control of the network and local devices.\n [You might also like: Smart Homes of Tomorrow â This is Not What We Expected]\nWhat architects, designers and consumers can do\nWhat new design concepts are needed to address these emerging technologies and risks presented by the ever-connected smart home? It not about informing everyone that everything can be hacked. Itâs about creating awareness and helping others understand the risks involved with modern technology. Itâs about helping the builders and designers understand the technological solutions required by their clients and how to implement them correctly, so they too can educate the user on how to maintain their system safely and securely.\nConsumers need to be aware of their devicesâ remote and local environment, and how their data is collected and stored. They also need to be aware of how their personal devices and appliances can be affected by outages outside of their control, like a DDoS attack on a cloud environment or something as simple as a power outage.\nFinally, we as a community need to put pressure on the manufacturers to produce secure devices with clear plans on how to patch and mitigate future vulnerabilities. Manufacturers also have to begin working together to insure user data and integrate it in a crowded environment of smart links and physical devices, ultimately preventing remote access. They need to focus on usability so that maintenance is simple and user-friendly with baked-in security features.\nIf architects, designers and owners are more aware and have a basic understanding about the devices and protocols they have incorporated into their smart homes, they will be better prepared to analyze the risks that are presented in these environments. They will also better understand how to minimize the possible impact of an affected system or device in the future by asking the right questions and purchasing devices from a manufacturer that is competent enough to maintain their service.\n[i] https://www.statista.com/statistics/682204/global-smart-home-market-size/\n[ii] https://www.statista.com/statistics/370350/internet-of-things-installed-base-by-category/\n[iii] https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/riot/\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cryptocurrencies\', \'IoT\', \'privacy\', \'Smart Homes\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/05/future-smart-homes/');

This role of organizing, equipping, training and leading the nation’s cybersecurity programs is not only ominous, it has thus far been an utter failure when historically approached.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Post reported that President Trump’s administration had eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator, with Rob Joyce leaving to return to the National Security Agency.\n\nLet’s see if we can offer some brief lessons from past failures and find out what went wrong:\nU.S. Cybersecurity Leadership: Historic Lessons Learned  \nFirst, let’s see how the nation has organized its past cybersecurity programs. Many would argue that the top leader of the information security program was the Cybersecurity Czar position first created by George W. Bush. Although the nation’s first Cyber Czar was outspoken and very knowledgeable, his style and approach left him unceremoniously departing the position within two years. Ironically many books were written about this time and many debates held, but I think one aspect of this position which is agreed to by most is that it accomplished little to prepare the country for cybersecurity posture and lead the country to the next level.\nAfter Mr. Clark’s departure there was a period of over two times his original tenure to find a new replacement as the position was reevaluated and moved to a new reporting structure within the National Cybersecurity Center. In 2008, Rod Beckstrom lead this new position for approximately a year and was regarded mostly as a lame duck leader with the reality of a new incoming administration.\n [You might also like: GDPR in Action, Even Facebook Impacted]\nWith the inauguration of Barak Obama in 2009, he not only kept this new position but ushered in a new Cybersecurity Coordinator center in the White House and appointed Melissa Hathaway as the nation’s new Cyber Czar. Unfortunately, once onboard, it was clear that Ms. Hathaway became disenfranchised and also unceremoniously departed after just two months on the job, providing the nation with the sobering realization that the top positions for U.S. Cyber Czar appears to be untenable.\nWikipedia List of Cybersecurity Czars since Inception – Including the Relation to Executive Office\nFederal CISO vs Cybersecurity Czar?\nNow, one might venture so far as to ask, if we already have a Federal Cyber Czar, what is the difference between this role and the Federal CISO role?\nWell, let’s look at the Responsibilities of the Cybersecurity Czar:\n“Cyberspace is real. And so are the risks that come with it,” Obama said in a May 2009 speech establishing the cybersecurity coordinator position. At that time, he also outlined three principal duties for the role:\n\nOrchestrate and integrate the government’s cyber policies.\nWork with the Office of Management and Budget to make sure federal agencies have the necessary funds to deal with cybersecurity issues.\nCoordinate the response to a major computer incident or attack.\n\nFulfilling these duties requires the cybersecurity czar to collaborate with various government agencies. For example, working with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which operates both a cyber-command to protect military computer networks and the Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory to deal with cases involving counterintelligence, terrorism and fraud. Within the DoD, he also works with the National Security Agency (NSA), which devises codes to protect sensitive information and monitors enemy communications.”\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nNow let’s look at the job description of the federal CISO illustrated by the previous Federal CIO, Tony Scott:\n\nServe as the federal government’s lead cybersecurity strategist in the continuing cybersecurity risk assessment of the federal IT environment by employing widely accepted frameworks.\nAct as the liaison between the White House and the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, the Office of the National Intelligence Director and agencies’ CISOs for all federal cybersecurity activities.\nReceive top secret/sensitive compartmented information security clearance. The federal CISO will handle information concerning and derived from sensitive intelligence sources, methods and analytical processes.\nMeet certain qualifications to be certified by an Office of Personnel Management review board to receive “senior executive service” designation. A senior executive service position is somewhat analogous to a high-ranking military officer.\nChair the Federal CIO Council’s Information Security and Identity Management Committee as part of his or her duty to effectively coordinate and align agencies’ CISO IT security governance.\nEstablish a government-wide program to address the recruitment, retention and training of cybersecurity experts, with a focus on not just technical experts, but also versatile professionals who can effectively expedite IT along with the government’s mission and business functions.\nDesign, implement and maintain effective cybersecurity performance measures for the federal government and lead the effort to maximize the value and effectiveness of security performance measures associated with the Federal Information Security Management Act, the law that governs federal IT security.\nOffer suggestions to the annual president’s budget that reflect cybersecurity priorities across federal agencies and ensure coordination and integration with the overall federal IT budget process.\n\n [You might also like: New Threat Landscape Gives Birth to New Way of Handling Cyber Security]\nFive Suggestions for Future CISO Success \nHave a vision and sell it!

The federal government needs someone who can balance the idea of a future vision, with the realities of how our government works and the ‘sausage factory’ it is in pursuit of the overall vision. This patience mustn’t be confused with a lack of energy or providing constant pressure, but rather a cool understanding and appropriate setting of the overall ‘challenge bar.’\nInvestment Balance: The issue that many have declared that the government is underfunded and lacks proper resources is a farce. Don’t be fooled in calling for even yet larger investments as there has been decades of GAO reports and unheralded failures of immense investments. The CISO will benefit greatly by trying to maximize the investment dollars of what is being spent already.\nEstablish a new framework: With accountability we need responsibility. Let’s face it, today these C-level positions within a government are mostly figureheads with no real operational responsibilities. For a high-performing CISO role to properly work, strategy and operations must be accountable to the role. This also means that compensation and a set of rewards and punishments must also be appropriately set. If a CISO accomplishes nothing more than setting in place a workable future structure whereby a security professional can be adequately compensated vis-à-vis an private industry peer and doesn’t need to take personal financial tradeoffs in order to employ their talents with the U.S. government, then they would have moved a mountain.\nLastly, you must execute.

It will regulate how Facebook collects and uses user data that is critical to the success of its advertisement business. While Facebook executives are claiming that GDPR will have minimal impact on its user base and its revenues, experts opine that there are multiple other ways that GDPR can affect Facebook in a severe manner. With GDPR being an extraordinary regulation with strong potential to impact large businesses, Facebook stands exposed to a number of uncertainties that are yet to take shape.\n\n\nBefore we dig deeper into the topic, let us do a quick recap of what GDPR actually is and what its implications are with respect to the functioning of businesses. The GDPR stands as an outcome of the European Union’s (EU) initiative to reform Europe’s existing data protection laws to a significant extent. The GDPR is meant to regulate businesses’ policies and actions with regard to the processing of people’s personal data and the use of such data. Any information regarding any identified or identifiable individual is considered as “personal data.” GDPR sets out clear guidelines for companies with regard to how they should store data in their systems in a secure manner, what they should do to accommodate transparency requirements, how they should identify and report data breach incidents, and what steps they should take to deliver appropriate data protection training to their privacy teams and employees.\n [You might also like: GDPR and HITECH: Can the past predict the future?]\nWith the implementation of GDPR, EU residents would have “data subject rights” that would allow them to exercise control over their personal information.

People are of the opinion that Facebook adopted “shadowy” patterns while designing the approval-seeking process with an objective of receiving users’ consent to the changes it made without letting them review the amendments properly. People found out that Facebook decreased the size and visual appearance of the buttons, which made review and decision-making difficult for the users. Experts opined that Facebook used shady designs to force people to quickly click the “Agree” button rather than encouraging users to make a choice on the basis of careful judgment. And all these translate into the perception that Facebook cares the least about people’s privacy and views GDPR as a barrier and not something that its users deserve to protect their privacy rights.\n [You might also like: WAF and DDoS Help You on the Road to GDPR Compliancy]\nSurprisingly, Facebook CFO Dave Wehner believes that GDPR will have no massive impact on Facebook’s online revenue, which demonstrated strong growth during Q1, defying the impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, data experts in Europe believe that Facebook will soon face lawsuits because of how it is responding to GDPR and because of the fact that the social networking giant’s requests for its users’ personal information are not compliant with the existing laws. A GDPR-breach can cost Facebook 4% of its annual growth revenue. Last year, Facebook’s global revenue stood at $39 billion, which means that 4% will amount to $1.6 billion.\nWhile we will wait to see if Facebook’s attempts to comply with GDPR are successful to prevent scrutiny and consequences, it’s time for other companies to start reviewing their existing privacy and data protection practices. Companies that will fail to ensure GDPR compliance would end up losing their reputation.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Data Protection\', \'facebook\', \'GDPR\', \'privacy\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/05/gdpr-facebook-impacted/');

This malware campaign is propagating via socially-engineered links on Facebook and is infecting users by abusing a Google Chrome extension (the âNigelifyâ application) that performs credential theft, cryptomining, click fraud and more.\n\nFurther investigation by Radwareâs Threat Research group has revealed that this group has been active since at least March of 2018 and has already infected more than 100,000 users in over 100 countries. Facebook malware campaigns are not new. Examples of similar operations include facexworm and digimine, but this group appears to have been undetected until now thanks to the campaign consistently changing applications and the use of an evasive mechanism for spreading the malware.\nFigure 1: The malware kill chain\nInfection Process\nRadware has dubbed the malware âNigelthornâ since the original Nigelify application replaces pictures to “Nigel Thornberry” and is responsible for a large portion of the observed infections. The malware redirects victims to a fake YouTube page and asks the user to install a Chrome extension to play the video.\nFigure 2: Fake YouTube page\nOnce the user clicks on âAdd Extension,â the malicious extension is installed and the machine is now part of the botnet. The malware depends on Chrome and runs on both Windows and Linux. It is important to emphasize that the campaign focuses on Chrome browsers and Radware believes that users that do not use Chrome are not at risk.\n [You might also like: Stresspaint Malware Campaign Targeting Facebook Credentials]\nBotnet Statistics\nRadware gathered the statistics from various sources, including the malicious extension statistics on the Chrome web store and the Bitly URL shortening service. A victim that clicks on âAdd Extensionâ is redirected to a Bitly URL from which they will be redirected to Facebook. This is done to trick users and retrieve access to their Facebook account.

To date, Radwareâs research group has observed seven of these malicious extensions, of which it appears four have been identified and blocked by Googleâs security algorithms. Nigelify and PwnerLike remain active.\nKnown Extensions\n\nThe Malware\nOnce the extension is installed on the Chrome browser, a malicious JavaScript (see below) is executed that downloads the initial configuration from the C2.\nFigure 5: Configuration file obtained from the C2\nAfterwards a set of requests is deployed, each with its own purpose and triggers. Here is the communication protocol.\n\nMalware Capabilities\nData theft\nThe malware is focused on stealing Facebook login credentials and Instagram cookies. If login occurs on the machine (or an Instagram cookie is found), it will be sent to the C2.\n\nThe user is then redirected to a Facebook API to generate an access token that will also be sent to the C2 if successful.\nFacebook Propagation\nAuthenticated usersâ Facebook access tokens are generated and the propagation phase begins. The malware collects relevant account information for the purpose of spreading the malicious link to the userâs network. The C2 path â/php3/doms.phpâ is accessed and returns a random URI. For example:\n\n \nThis link is distributed one of two ways: as a message via Facebook Messenger or as a new post that includes tags for up to 50 contacts. Once the victim clicks on the link, the infection process starts over again and redirects them to a YouTube-like webpage that requires a âplugin installationâ to view the video.\n [You might also like: Why Cyber-Security Is Critical to The Loyalty of Your Most Valued Customers]\nCryptomining\nAnother plugin that is downloaded by the malware is a cryptomining tool. The attackers are using a publicly available browser-mining tool to get the infected machines to start mining cryptocurrencies. The JavaScript code is downloaded from external sites that the group controls and contains the mining pool. Radware observed that in the last several days the group was trying to mine three different coins (Monero, Bytecoin and Electroneum) that are all based on the âCryptoNightâ algorithm that allows mining via any CPU.\nThe pools Radware has witnessed are:\nâ¢ supportxmr.com – 46uYXvbapq6USyzybSCQTHKqWrhjEk5XyLaA4RKhcgd3WNpHVXNxFFbXQYETJox6C5Qzu8yiaxeXkAaQVZEX2BdCKxThKWA\nâ¢ eu.bytecoin-pool.org – 241yb51LFEuR4LVWXvLdFs4hGEuFXZEAY56RB11aS6LXXG1MEKAiW13J6xZd4NfiSyUg9rbERYpZ7NCk5rptBMFE5uZEinQ\nâ¢ etn.nanopool.org – etnk7ivXzujEHf1qXYfNZiczo4ohA4Rz8Fv4Yfc8c5cU1SRYWHVry7Jfq6XnqP5EcL1LiehpE3UzD3MBfAxnJfvh3gksNp3suN\nAt the time of writing, approximately $1,000 was mined over six days, mostly from the Monero pool.\nFigure 6: Cryptomining\nPersistency\nThe malware uses numerous techniques to stay persistent on the machine and to ensure its activities on Facebook are persistent.\n1. If the user tries to open the extensions tab to remove the extension, the malware closes it and prevents removal.\n\n \n2. The malware downloads URI Regex from the C2 and blocks users that try to access those patterns.

The retrieved instructions can be to either watch, like or comment on a video or to subscribe to the page. Radware believes the group is trying to receive payments from YouTube though we have not witnessed any videos with high view counts.

It is fair to say that your DDoS protection is only as good as your SLA.\nUse these six questions to evaluate how good your DDoS protection is. Each SLA metric has a specific technical benchmark and defined business purpose. Not having one (or more) of these KPIs in your SLA document should cast doubt on your vendor’s confidence in their own service, and ultimately the vendors’ ability to protect your organization against DDoS attacks.\nAsk these six questions of your DDoS mitigation provider:\nHow Soon Can You Detect Attacks?\nThe first step in stopping a DDoS attack is recognizing that an attack is taking place. Many vendors will make bold claims on mitigation time, but the question is mitigation from when?  The sooner an attack can be identified the sooner that attack can be migitated. With a Time-to-Detect SLA, your DDoS mitigation vendor commits to how quickly they will detect an attack. Not including the Time-to-Detect leaves you exposed to the possibility that a DDoS attack could be well under way before its noticed.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nHow Quickly Will You Let Me Know?\nWhen something bad happens, you want to be the first to know about it. The Time to Alert SLA is crucial for ensuring that you’re notified immediately if under attack.

Any delay in diversion can result in needless downtime. The Time to Divert SLA commits to how fast your mitigation provider will initiate diversion once an attack has been detected.

This is a key metric, and unwillingness to commit to mitigation time should cast serious doubt on their ability to stop attacks.\n How Do You Measure Quality of Protection?\nShakespeare said that “a rose, by any other name, would smell just as sweet.” Sadly, the same is not true when it comes to DDoS protection. Apart from the time it takes to mitigate an attack, a key consideration is the quality of mitigation. The Consistency of Mitigation metric provides a baseline to calculate the effectiveness of mitigation, and how much bad traffic is allowed through. A high-level mitigation threshold will only allow less than 5% of attack traffic to go through. Not including a Consistency of Mitigation commitment in your SLA effectively renders Time-to-Mitigate commitments meaningless because vendors can pass almost anything for ‘mitigation’ and claim to meet mitigation SLAs.\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nHow Reliable is Your Service?\nFinally, when under attack, you want to be sure that your mitigation service will be available to take over. The Service Availability metric defines uptime requirements for service, and how much downtime will be tolerated on an annual basis. A high-quality service will commit to at-least 99.999% of uptime, which means only about 5 minutes of allowed downtime throughout the year.  If your SLA does not include a Service Reliability commitment, that should make you wonder whether it will be there in a time of need.\n\nThese six performance indicators are crucial to guarantee the effectiveness of your DDoS protection. These metrics should be outlined in clear, straightforward terms inside your SLA document. If you don’t see them – ask your vendor about how those guarantees are provided and what they commit to. And if you don’t like their answers, perhaps you should look at alternatives.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'SLA\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/05/6-must-have-sla-metrics/');

Todayâs modern home security system typically includes a centralized control system that can monitor and control a number of different connected devices including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth locks, lighting, wireless cameras, and thermostats.\nSmart home devices cover nearly every aspect of modern living including kitchen and home appliances, energy and water management as well as a number of different types of environmental sensors. Energy and water management systems include connected items in their systems such as lights, switches and plugs, thermostats, and motorized blinds as well as other systems designed to allow the occupant to sense, track, modify and automate their home environment for efficiency and financial benefit. Environmental home sensors can include devices designed to detect motion, gestures and sounds as well as water leaks, temperature changes, smoke and carbon monoxide. These connected sensors report data back to a central hub which then will notify the user via an in-house panel or a mobile application. Other connected devices included remote-controlled appliances typically found in the kitchen, home robots, and digital assistance including sleep and fitness trackers.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nProtocols\nOne of the first things we can do is understand how these devices operate and the risks that they present. Smart home devices mentioned above typically connect to the internet through a few different protocols. The four most common protocols used in todayâs smart home devices include Z-Wave, ZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nSamsung SmartThings Smart Home Monitor Kit\nZigbee & Z-Wave â Zigbee and Z-Wave are both low-powered wireless networks with the ability to form a mesh network, making them a great option for smart homes sensors. These sensors are normally low-cost, low-bandwidth, battery-operated devices that send data to the occupant via an internet-connected central hub. These networks work great within smart homes but do have a few slight differences when it comes to speed, range and energy consumption. Zigbee has the ability to host tens of thousands of devices, but the range per devices is about 30-60 feet. The protocol is found in devices such as Philips Hue, Amazon Echo Plus and Belkin WeMo products.Â  Z-Wave has the ability to host only a few hundred devices per network but has a greater range than Zigbee at 100-150 feet. Â This protocol is found in devices such as Kwikset Smart Locks, Wink 2 Hub and even the Dome smart mouse, rat and rodent traps (yes, thatâs a thing). Both protocols are supported in devices like Samsung SmartThings, Honeywell Thermostats, Yale smart locks, GE appliances and ADT security hub.\nSamsung Family Hub Fridge\nWi-Fi â Wi-Fi is one of the most widely known protocols and utilized to support data-intensive devices in smart homes. Wi-Fi provides a fast option in smart homes to replace the need for high speed cables. Typically, Wi-Fi is used to support laptops, tablets and phones, but in recent years it has been rapidly adopted by IoT vendors for specific products in home automation, security systems and energy management.Â  Wi-Fi doesnât necessarily fit the needs of all IoT devices. If a device requires batteries to last months and is not bandwidth-intensive, protocols like Zigbee and Z-wave may be used in its place.\nBluetooth Master Locks\nBluetooth â Bluetooth is used for low energy and small solutions and has a higher data bandwidth rate than Zigbee and Z-Wave. Originally Bluetooth was intended for wireless headsets but has since expanded with the evolution of smart home design, industrial applications and smart stadiums. Today you can find Bluetooth technology used in a number of appliances such as keyboards, gaming consoles, toothbrushes, environmental sensors, smart locks and other portable equipment. In Levi’sÂ® Stadium you can order food to your seat and navigate the stadium for a bathroom via Bluetooth.\n [You might also like: Is My Smart Home Telling People What I Do Every Day?]\nControllers\nSmart homes are controlled in a number of different ways including cellular and networked devices. Hubs are control centers that act as bridges for connected devices that need to communicate with the user via the hub. Hubs are devices like Home Seer, Nexia, Samsung SmartThings, Apple Homekit and Cisco Smart + Connected Residential solution. These control devices forward the information from the sensors via the internet to occupantsâ mobile devices or in-house panel. These hubs are often essential for remote access and control of your home from around the world. They allow you to turn lights and appliances on and off, unlock doors, watch security cameras, monitor energy usage, check temperature and read humidity sensors that can send you pictures of movements on your property to you, wherever you may be.\nCisco Smart Connected Home Controller\nSelecting a hub can be a difficult choice depending on what the intended use and demands are from the home occupants. When selecting a central controller, consider the technology and protocols you have incorporated in your smart home design, how those devices are supposed to communicate with a central hub, and what the desired functionalities are for your smart environment.\nClosing\nBut what does all of this mean? If architects, designers and owners are more aware and have a basic understanding about the devices and protocols they have incorporated into their smart home, they will be better prepared to analyze the risks that are presented in these environments and how to minimize the possible impact of an affected system or devices on their network.\nThe idea of automating everything today is very much alive, but instead of pushing physical buttons to control mechanical devices we want to control our environments conveniently through central hubs and smartphone apps from anywhere in the world.\nSo what is the risk of living a better, more efficient life through smart homes? A lot. Given the growth in the threat landscape by connecting everything to the internet, we are presented with three core issues: Privacy, vulnerability and reliability. Currently these three subjects plague almost every connected device currently on the market, but what can designers, builders and consumers do to secure and protect the home of tomorrow from these issues? What new design concepts are needed to address these emerging technologies and risks present by the ever-connected smart home?\nIn my final blog of this series I will cover why there has been an increase in people choosing to incorporate smart, automated devices into their homes, the risks that these devices present, and what architects, designers and consumers can do to secure and protect these homes.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'Smart Homes\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/smart-homes-of-tomorrow-connect-all-things/');

The first part of this series covered premise-based hardware solutions, the second part discussed on-demand cloud solutions, and the third part covered always-on cloud solutions. This final piece will explore hybrid DDoS solutions, which combine both hardware and cloud-based components.\n\n\nHybrid Protection: Enjoying the Best of Both Worlds\nWhereas a premise-based solution relies strictly on a local hardware appliance, and on-demand and always-on solutions are purely cloud based, a hybrid model combines a local hardware appliance together with expandable capacity in case of a large volumetric attack.\nDuring the normal course of business, traffic flows directly to the data center. The premise-based appliance will inspect for attack traffic, and block most attacks. However, if a large-scale attack is detected which may overwhelm the device (or even completely saturate the pipe), then traffic is diverted to a cloud scrubbing center. The scrubbing center will block attack traffic and send only clean traffic to the customer. Once the attack is over, traffic is diverted back to the device, who resumes normal function.\nHybrid DDoS protection allows organizations to enjoy the best of both worlds: the low latency and high-control of premise-based solutions together with the scalable capacity of cloud solutions.\n [You might also like: The Cyber Threat Alliance â Stopping Attackers in their Tracks]\nAdvantages and Drawbacks:\nJust like other deployment models, there are certain advantages and drawbacks to choosing a hybrid DDoS protection solution:\n\nBest quality of protection: Hybrid protection is the recommended best practice by most security analysts, as it combines both low latency and high capacity for protection of mission-critical services.\nImmediate detection: Since traffic flows through the local appliance at all times, attacks can be detected immediately by the appliance. This is an advantage particularly over cloud on-demand services, which usually have a detection and protection gap until diversion is initiated.\nFlexible capacity: A key advantage to the hybrid model is the availability of flexible mitigation capacity in case of large-scale volumetric attacks. Such attacks can overwhelm standalone hardware appliances and even saturate the entire pipe going into the data center. Having backup cloud capacity allows customers to handle any attack, regardless of size.\nLow latency: Hybrid solutions allow for low latency, as day-to-day protection is handled by on-prem appliances directly in the data center. Only in times of attack will traffic be diverted to the cloud. This is an advantage of cloud always-on solutions which usually add some latency to communications, even during peacetime.\nRegulation: Companies in regulated industries such as finance or healthcare are frequently constrained in their ability to migrate services to the cloud. Therefore, a hybrid solution could be useful in providing on-prem location most of the time while still allowing for backup capacity in case of large-scale attacks.\nControl: Having an on-prem device allows for greater control and configurability, especially for organizations with unique network topologies or specific needs.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nHowever, the hybrid DDoS protection model also entails a number of drawbacks:\n\nManagement overhead: Having a premise-based solution usually incurs higher management overhead and staff requirements, as well as keeping premise-based and cloud-based defenses synchronized and aligned at all times.\nCost: Since a hybrid solution combines both a hardware appliance and cloud service, their combined cost usually tends to be higher than a strictly cloud service.\n\nConsiderations:\nLike other models, the choice of whether or not to use hybrid protection depends on the organizationâs particular use case and needs:\n\nThreat Profile: What is the threat profile of your data center? If your data center is running mission-critical services which cannot afford to go down, then perhaps a hybrid solution is indeed the route to go.\nControl: How much emphasis do you put on control and management? Some organizations put a high premium on control and configurability, so an on-prem appliance could suit them.\nRegulated industry: Is the organization in a regulated industry? If so, what are the guidelines regarding migrating workloads to the cloud? A hybrid solution could be a good solution for regulated companies since they provide the security of on-prem equipment with the expandable scalability of the cloud.\nCost: What are the budget constraints and what is the available budget? Hybrid solutions tend to provide a higher quality of protection compared to standalone on-prem or cloud solutions, but this protection usually comes with a higher price tag.\n\n [You might also like: Rethinking the Scrubbing Center]\nWho Is It Best For?\nLooking at the relative merits and drawbacks of the hybrid model, there are several types of customers (and use-cases) for who this model makes the most sense for:\n\nData center protection: Customers who have existing data centers and have many services running in those data centers which they need to protect.\nMission-critical applications: Mission critical applications which require both constant protection and cannot go down even for a short time.\nLatency sensitive: Services which require fast (or real-time) responsiveness, and have low latency tolerance.\nRegulated industries: Companies in regulated industries who are constrained in moving workloads to the cloud.\n\nHowever, there are also certain use-cases in which a hybrid solution may not be best:\n\nCloud-hosted applications: Applications which are hosted on public clouds (such as AWS or Azure), and for whom there is no physical data center to place an appliance in. For such applications, a cloud-based solution is required.\nPrice sensitive: Organizations which donât have much budget to allocate for such comprehensive solutions. For such organizations, an on-demand cloud solution will usually be the best option.\n\nA Buffet, Not a Fixed Menu\nAs we explained in the opening segment of this blog series, DDoS protection is a buffet, not a fixed menu. There are many DDoS protection providers, who provide varying levels of protection and cost. Every model has its relative merits and disadvantages; there are many options, and itâs up to each customer to choose the optimal solution for their particular use-case.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'Hybrid\', \'Hybrid Cloud\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/choosing-the-right-ddos-solution-hybrid-protection/');

The 5G networks would essentially promote the use of a huge number of interconnected devices, a tremendous increase in bandwidth, and collaborative functioning of legacy and new access technologies. Undoubtedly, the upcoming 5G environment would demand the deployment of additional security mechanisms to ensure business continuity. 5G systems are meant to be service-oriented, which is why it is important to address the security challenges appropriately and to focus on instilling stronger security and privacy settings in 5G networks.\n\n\nSecurity challenges that 5G networks may face:\n\nEmergence of new business models: 5G is on its way to serve vertical industries, not just individual customers who are more bothered about experiencing a faster mobile network or richer smart phone functionalities. When it comes to serving vertical industries, security requirements may vary from one service to the other. As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to gain momentum, more people will be able to remotely operate networked devices and this will surely call for the deployment of a stricter user-authentication method to prevent unauthorized access to IoT devices. For example, biometric identification systems can be installed in smart homes.\nIT-focused network architecture: 5G networks are believed to be enhanced by the deployment of new cost-effective IT technologies such as virtualization and Software Defined Network (SDN)/Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). However, 5G services can be equipped with appropriate security mechanisms only if the network infrastructure is robust enough to support the security features. The security of function network elements, in legacy networks, depends, to a large extent, on how well their physical entities could be separated from each other. In 5G networks that are mainly based on cloud-based infrastructure, this isolation will function in a different way, thereby encouraging the industry to put more focus on 5G infrastructure security.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n [You might also like: 5G Mobile Security Challenge]\nBuilding Service-Oriented Security \n\nDifferentiated Security Mechanisms: Different services would require different levels of security. For example, lightweight security can suit the requirements of IoT while remote healthcare services will demand resilient security. Different services would require differentiated security mechanisms that would rely on flexible security architecture to support end-to-end protection. In cloud environment, where multiple vendors provide software and equipment for network infrastructure, security concerns may get more complicated. This scenario can be addressed by building an E2E data security chain that would not only reduce dependence on individual link security, but would also streamline security management.\nProviding Security as a Service: Networks can offer security systems as a service to vertical industries. Networks may choose to validate service access and send back the authorization result to vertical industries. The network may decide whether it would implement the security service on a cloud platform or deploy it in a virtual network slice of the industry that has paid for the security service.\nSegregating Virtual Network Slices: It is important for networks to separate virtual network slices to protect the confidentiality of information and prevent one user’s resources from being accessed by other users in other slices. For example, Company A may choose to block other companies from using its resources even though similar virtual network slices are serving the needs of these companies.\nSafeguarding User Privacy: A large number of vertical industries will be served by 5G networks and hence, information security and user privacy would become crucial to the success of 5G networks. Progress in data mining technologies has eased the process of retrieval of user privacy information, which is why additional care should be taken to protect user information in 5G networks. Data breach can lead to severe consequences. 5G networks should promote efficient usage management practices to protect user data. 5G networks function by sensing the service features of users and providing customized network services. However, this sensing process may promote the utilization of users’ confidential information. Therefore, 5G networks should abide by a service sensing rule that should define how networks should use privacy information and how it should handle that information after using it.\n\nAs a matter of fact, incorporation of security and privacy features is often viewed as a constraint during the system design process. But if such requirements are ignored at the initial stages, it may translate into costs in the long run. When security features are added at the later stages of system design, they produce less-optimal results or prove to be costlier than mechanisms that could have been installed at the initial stage. In the long run, the strength of security mechanisms would determine the fate of 5G networks. 5G networks, at present, are undergoing evolution, which means the world would witness stronger 5G networks provided the security and privacy considerations are addressed properly.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'5G\', \'IoT\', \'NFV\', \'SDN\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/overcoming-5g-security-challenges/');

The group manipulates victims via phishing emails to download a painting application called ‘Relieve Stress Paint.’ While benign in appearance, it runs a malware dubbed ‘Stresspaint’ in the background. Within a few days, the group had infected over 40,000 users, stealing tens of thousands Facebook user credentials/cookies. This rapid distribution and high infection rate indicates this malware was developed professionally. The group is specifically interested in users who own Facebook pages and that contain stored payment methods. We suspect that the group’s next target is Amazon as they have a dedicated section for it in the attack control panel. Radware will continue to analyze the campaign and monitor the group’s activity. Prior to publication of this alert, Radware has detected another variant of the malware and saw indication of this new version in the control panel.\n\nFigure 1 & 2: Breakdown of malware by infections and geographies\nInfection Process\nRadware suspects the infection campaign is via phishing emails or directly on Facebook itself (Radware has not yet received one). Recipients are led to believe they are going to legitimate sites (i.e. AOL) to download a legitimate application, however the site is really a Unicode domain of the AOL site.\nFigure 3: The phony website\nThe site advertises an application called “Relieve Stress Paint” and contains a download link.\nWhile the application or website are not yet visible by search engines, specific strings in the site led Radware to a site on Google called ‘aol.net.’ This is not really ‘aol.net’ but rather a Unicode representation of aol.net and its true address is ‘xn--80a2a18a.net.’\nFigure 4: The malicious website as indexed by Google\n [You might also like: Why Cyber-Security Is Critical to The Loyalty of Your Most Valued Customers]\nThe Malware\nOnce the file is downloaded and executed, a window is opened showing the “legitimate program” to the user. This is a paint program that changes colors and line size for each click.\nFigure 5: Screenshot of paint program\nIn the background, the malware immediately starts running and dropping files on the system.\n\nTemp\\\\DX.exe – the main module of the malware that remains persistent on the system\nTemp\\\\updata.dll – possibly used later on for credential/cookie stealing purposes\nDesktop\\RelieveStressPaint.lnk – a desktop link to run the original downloaded executable.

We have seen two different parameters which may indicate two different infection campaigns that the author wants to track. This is also represented in the control panel.\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\VirtualStore\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\RelieveStressPaint\\guid- with the value of user GUID. This is saved in the following format [5 random letters/numbers]HHMMSSYYYYMMDD.\n\nAfterwards, a connectivity check is done to a specific Instagram profile. Radware believes this is done to receive instructions or updates (this matter is still under investigation).\nFacebook Data Theft\nInformation is stolen when the malware is run for the first time, if the user runs the application again (using the .lnk on his desktop), and every restart of the computer. It is done by copying the content of Chrome browser cookies and login data files to a new location and querying the data from there. Once saved login credentials (username + password) or Facebook cookies are found, they are sent encrypted to the C2 in the following format:\n{\\”fid\\”:\\”%s\\”,\\”fpwd\\”:\\”%s\\”,\\”cookies\\”:\\”%s\\”,%s}\nFigure 6: Exfiltration of compromised user credentials to the C&C server\nOn other requests, general information on the infected machine is sent in the following format:\n{\\”guid\\”:\\”%s\\”,\\”os\\”:\\”%s\\”,\\”agent\\”:\\”%s\\”,\\”Auto\\”:%s,\\”flag\\”:%s,\\”data\\”:%s,\\”seller\\”:\\”%s\\”}\nOnce the credentials are validated and access is granted, additional data is collected, such as number of friends, whether the account manages a page or not, and if the payment method is configured for the account. This is done by accessing several predefined Facebook URLs which return this information.  All requests are accomplished using the hard coded User agent:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36\nStealth\nThe malware authors decided to leverage a specific data theft method to stay hidden on the system as long as they can.\n\nNo general credential stealing is done which might raise some flags by security vendors\nThe cookies and saved password theft is only accomplished from querying copies of the original cookies/login data files\nThe process that is in charge of the credential theft resides on the system for less than a minute each time\n\nSince they are interested only in Facebook access at this stage, they get it either from the first infection saved login/cookies or when the computer is restarted.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nControl Panel\nThe operators of this botnet decided to use an open source Chinese CMS called Layuicms2.0. They have customized it to show information of the botnet outbreak such as stolen credentials and cookies, but also other metrics and the ability to export Facebook data. The panel also features a section for Amazon, but it is not yet functional. Radware believes that this implies that the group’s next target will be Amazon.\nFigure 7: Control panel (translated from Chinese by Google Chrome)\nFigure 8: Users’ data\nPossible Impact\nSince the group is at the data collection phase, Radware can only speculate what the operators of this botnet do with the stolen credentials.\n\nMonetization – simply selling stolen credentials to malicious actors and cyber-criminals. Online identities have been traded over the dark web for some time.\nRansom – extort victims by threating them to reveal personal information like photos etc.\nEspionage – take advantage of the possessed credentials to track specific people’s activity, network and conversations\nProfit – use the stolen credentials and payment information to shop on eCommerce sites and services\nIdentity Theft – reuse the credentials to log-in into other accounts or services via Facebook.\n\nHowever, the fact that this group is looking specifically for accounts with pages, and members with large networks, lead us to consider a couple of additional options.\n\nMalvertising – with the stolen credentials, access to web pages and payment details, the group can launch malicious advertisement campaigns, whether to make profit or spread more malwares. They can use small amounts from each user without raising suspicion and collect a critical mass to launch any activity.\nPropaganda – with the same information, instead of advertising a product or a service, they can run a campaign to promote their agenda and reveal people/personal identities\n\n [You might also like: Can Security Be Efficient Without Expertise or Intelligence?]\nSteps to Protect From Data Harvesting Malwares\n\nDetect new zero-day malware using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms\nBlock new threats by integrating with existing protection mechanisms and defense layers\nReport on malware infection attempts in your network\nAudit defenses against new exploits and see where you are vulnerable\n\nAs this malware rapidly expands, the group will certainly continue to try to find new ways to utilize the stolen assets. Such groups continuously create new malware and mutations to bypass security controls. Radware recommends individuals and organizations to update their current password and only download applications from trusted sources. Radware’s Malware Research Group will keep monitoring and analyzing new threats to provide protection to its customers.\nDisclosure\nWe have brought our research findings to the Facebook information security team, including all the stolen credentials of the accounts.

But perhaps more than anything, it highlights why cyber-security is critical to securing the loyalty of your organization’s most valued customers.\n\nIn today’s digitally-driven, customer-centric world where consumers own the relationship, businesses invest large sums of political and financial capital into customer centricity, and loyalty programs are at the forefront of these efforts.\n\nAnd while executives are quick to focus on the end-game benefits of a loyal-centric strategy…like more satisfied customers, increased loyalty, a lower cost to serve and more engaged employees…the road to a failed loyalty program (and/or PR black eye) is often paved with missed opportunities and what-ifs. Chief among them, making security front and center from the get-go.\n [You might also like: The Cyber Threat Alliance – Stopping Attackers in their Tracks]\nTypically, loyalty programs aren’t treated as digital jewels to be protected until AFTER there’s a security breach. Lost data equals lost loyalty. When a customer loyalty program is designed with security as an afterthought, organizations run the risk of exposing high-value digital assets and data. Resulting breaches devalue and compromise a loyalty program, resulting in lost time, money and customer faith.\nMoreover, any resulting loss in customer faith opens the door to competitors to hijack your organization’s customers at a time when your brand is vulnerable. Like vultures circling a wounded animal, compromised customer data, and the resulting fallout, is just as valuable to competitors as it is to the hackers that executed the cyber-attack.\nResearch underscores this. According to KPMG’s Consumer Loss Barometer, 19% of consumers surveyed would stop shopping at a retailer that has been the victim of a hack and 33% would stop shopping at the retailer for at least three months. The largest barrier to returning to a breached merchant is “lack of a solid plan to prevent further attacks,” according to the report.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nData That is Spread Far and Wide\nIn the past 12-18 months, customer data breaches have largely been fueled by the transition to the cloud. In the case of Sears, payment information belonging to thousands of customers was compromised via a 3rd party, cloud-based chat service. As cybercrime expert Brian Krebs said in a tweet about the breach: “In general I’d say these online chat features are a major cybersecurity liability for most corporations, esp. for threat from social engineering.”\nKrebs’ point underscores the fact that transitioning to the cloud is a double-edged sword. The benefits are clear: increased speed, improved agility, improved services and more cost savings. The downside? A heterogeneous collection of cloud computing environments, each with different security policies and requirements. Gaps between these clouds create security risks. These gaps are the vulnerabilities that cyber assailants and their shapeshifting attacks seek to exploit.\nThe result? A tarnished user experience for today’s digital consumer. A damaged brand. Lost revenue.\n [You might also like: Can Security Be Efficient Without Expertise or Intelligence?]\nWhat’s Yours Is Mine\nWith organizations dispersing consumer data across multiple environments, the security of a 3rd party provider becomes your organization’s security. Their gaps become your gaps. Driven by the need to satisfy consumer expectations and outclass the competition, businesses are doubling-down on loyalty programs. As a result, business management often ratchet ups the pressure to implement new mobile services, provide seamless integration or deploy new applications quickly. Security is often viewed as an anchor that slows the rollout of these services, yet security is the very cornerstone to securing the user experience, and thus loyalty, for today’s digital consumer.\nThe key to overcoming this shortsighted, after-the-fact approach is placing security front and center by bringing the security executive and C-suite together. The security of loyalty programs must transition from the domain of reactive disaster recovery and business continuity into the realm of proactive protection. If loyalty programs are designed to focus on the percentage of your organization’s most valuable customers, why wouldn’t its security fall in line with the other mission-critical assets and infrastructure responsible for servicing these very clients?\nExecutives at organizations both large and small should heed the data breaches of the past weeks and evaluate how secure their customer loyalty programs really are in the face of today’s surreptitious hacker…and just how valuable they are to securing the loyalty of your most valued customers.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'customer experience\', \'Customer Loyalty\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/why-cyber-security-is-critical-to-the-loyalty-of-valued-customers/');

Sophisticated new botnets, the increase in DDoS-as-a-Service tools, and the rise in cryptocurrency are creating an unpredictable environment where even novice attackers can demand ransoms, carry out attacks, and rent IoT botnets. Known attack types also rise and fall in popularity, as demonstrated by recent attacks such as Memcached. âWhatâs old is new again,â but with a twist of a new vector or motive. This provides one of the biggest challenges for those of us in the cyber-security community. How do we make sure that we are identifying and mitigating attacks quickly, protecting our customers and the organizations they serve with minimal business impact?\n\n\nThe future of threat intelligence must include information sharing. This is the goal of organizations like the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), where security companies collaborate to share intel on the constant evolution of threats. Although by nature the cyber-security industry is typically top-secret and competitive, there is also a shared understanding that by pooling our resources, we are able to adapt our techniques and technology for the greater good, making companies feel infinitely safer and protected.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nIf we are all reviewing shared intel, everyone has a better chance of designing proactive solutions vs. reactive solutions for these emerging threats. Combining our intelligence creates an extension of everyoneâs capabilities. By combining our various strengths and experience, we have a better chance of stopping whatever cyber-threats come our way.\n [You might also like: Can Security Be Efficient Without Expertise or Intelligence?]\nWe need to be continuously learning how these attackers might come after businesses in a variety of industries, such as finance, healthcare, retail, and more. Many cyber-security organizations started off as hardware-centric companies, but we are seeing a shift to more software-based solutions as companies change how they store their data and interact with customers. Itâs important for security products to have some levels of both detection and mitigation, or work together to achieve that balance and prevent threat actors from accessing the networks. For example, our partner Cisco detects threats from every angle, and then kicks complex attack traffic over to Radwareâs scrubbing centers around the world, which can mitigate more than 3.5Tbps of traffic. This helps keep customers up and running, allows legitimate traffic to reach its destination, and prevents latency. When companies are thinking similarly and working together as a consortium, we improve this process and become very powerful, creating a legacy for customers who are demanding this kind of evolution.\nAccess to real-time intelligence from a centralized community provides a significant advantage as attacks continue to get more complex. Fortunately, the CTA is up to the challenge, and each member brings something different to the table that helps the organization as a whole see the larger picture of threat intelligence.

The reason would be that the security partner, or better yet – the vendor, will always be the number one expert for the solutions it brings to market. So, if you want to make sure you are making the most out of your investment, let security be managed by experts. In one of three cases, it’s not even about the security management, it is simply about responding to events. According to Radware’s 2017-2018 Global Network and Application Security Report, 33% of organizations have no emergency response plan to the event of a data breach, DDoS attack or any other form of malicious activity.\nIf this attack is launched by a determined threat actor and lasts more than 24 hours, the IT security teams in three out of five companies will be exhausted fighting it off after the first day. With the exponential growth of IoT devices integrated into the networks, the primary concern of security professionals is the impact on the complexity of security management. Not to mention the variety of platforms and frameworks that must be securely integrated.\n\nEven if you have a skilled SOC that is able to address most of the events against your information network, there are some highly sophisticated attacks or simply new ones that exploit new vulnerabilities. You would want to make sure your vendor backs you up in emergencies, and is there for you within 10-15 minutes while the situation can be contained.\n [You might also like: Entering into the 1Tbps Era]\nLet’s be intelligent\nIn addition, the solution you use is usually tailored to handle threats that are known when it is developed and introduced. Indeed, self-learning solutions are emerging today and in order to optimize their detection and decision making accuracy (i.e. avoid ‘suffering’) – or in other words, make them more ‘intelligent’ – they must be constantly introduced to new attack types. Threat intelligence feeds contribute to keeping the solutions up to date and capable of detecting and blocking new attack types as they emerge. Ongoing, emergency and customized signature updates in addition to real-time data from events that are happening in an information-sharing network will maximize the protection delivered by the solution. Think about national security – known criminals or those who are engaged in planning a terrorist act will not be granted a visa, and will not be let on the plane. Same here – if you are able to recognize a certain source as malicious, why let the threat get anywhere your network? It can be blocked at the perimeter without the ability to form any communication or attack.\nExpertise and intelligence are a must-have against evolving threats.\nSince service availability is a key factor for businesses today, there is little room for trial and error in the event of a cyber-attack. Even during peacetime organizations must reduce the attack surface as much as possible and prevent threat actors from getting anywhere near their valued assets. Maintaining application SLAs, keeping data confidential and assuring performance and flow are all critical requirements that are complex to achieve in today’s threat landscape. Organizations who struggle to maintain updated knowledge of this threat landscape require access to security expertise and real-time intelligence to protect their network assets, applications and data. Even with the best protection devices and a knowledgeable staff – denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, application exploits or malware outbreaks are a major challenge to your business and can create unwanted situations.

The first parts of this series covered premise-based appliances and on-demand cloud services. This installment will cover always-on cloud DDoS protection deployments, its advantages and drawbacks, and what use-cases are best for it. The final part of this series will focus on hybrid deployments, which combine premise-based and cloud-based protections.\n\n\nAlways-On: Uninterrupted cloud-based protection\nDDoS protection solutions using an âalways-onâ model work by constantly routing all customer traffic through the network of the DDoS mitigation provider. Customers change their routing advertisements (usually BPG or DNS) to the network of their DDoS mitigation provider, who then routes all traffic through its scrubbing centers. Communications are then scrubbed for malicious traffic, and only clean traffic is forwarded to the customer.\nThe difference between the on-demand model and the always-on model is that whereas in the on-demand model traffic is diverted through the providerâs network only for limited durations, when an attack has been detected, in the always-on model traffic is diverted through the providerâs network at all times.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nAdvantages & Drawbacks:\nUsing an always-on DDoS protection service provides for a number of key benefits:\n\nUninterrupted protection: One of the biggest benefits of the always-on model is the fact that you are protected at all times against DDoS attacks. Unlike the on-demand model, where diversion and protection are activated for limited times only after an attack has been detected, under the always-on model customers are always protected.\nNo protection gaps: Another advantage of the always-on model compared to the on-demand model is that there are no protection gaps during the detection and diversion stages. Most on-demand models detect attacks based on volumetric traffic thresholds. Only once the threshold has been reached will diversion be initiated. The detection and diversion steps may take up to several minutes, during which time the application is still exposed. Under the always-on model, traffic is constantly routed through the DDoS mitigation provider, and therefore this gap does not exist.\nLow management overhead: An always-on deployment usually requires low management overhead. Once initial configuration of the service is complete, there is no need for additional overhead, as traffic is constantly routed.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nHowever, there are also some downsides to this approach:\n\nLatency: A large drawback of the always-on model is the introduction of additional latency. Since all traffic is routed through the network of the DDoS mitigation provider, this will inevitably lead to additional latency to traffic. The amount of latency will depend on the location of the providerâs scrubbing center, distance from customer host, and connectivity.\nCost: Since traffic is always routed through the scrubbing center on a constant basis, always-on deployments use up more bandwidth than on-demand services. As a result, always-on service tends to be noticeably more expensive than an on-demand service.\n\nConsiderations:\nWhen evaluating an always-on DDoS protection service, there are a few key factors to take into consideration:\n\nLatency: How tolerant is the application to latency? Using an always-on service will usually add some degree of latency to connections. The amount of latency will usually be minor, but it depends on the application and its specific use-case as to whether this level is acceptable.\nFrequency of attack: How frequently is the application attacked? If they come under constant attack, then an always-on service will make sense. However, if the customer is only infrequently attacked (or never at all), then perhaps an on-demand service might be more cost-effective.\nBudget: What is the allocated budget? Always-on services tend to be more expensive than comparable on-demand services.\n\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution â Part I: On-Prem Appliance]\nWho Is It Best For?\nTaking into consideration the relative merits and drawbacks of an always-on cloud DDoS protection service, there are a number of use cases for which this model is particularly suitable:\n\nCritical applications: Mission-critical applications that cannot afford any downtime at all, even not a few minutes. The always-on aspect of the service will ensure the application is constantly protected.\nFrequently attacked: Companies that frequently come under attack. In this case an on-demand service doesnât make sense since it will constantly be diverting on or off.\nLow latency sensitivity: Applications that are not sensitive to the minor added latency usually incurred by such services.\n\nHowever, there are also use cases for which such a solution is less suited for:\n\nLatency-sensitive applications: Real-time applications with high sensitivity to latency. In this case, an on-prem or hybrid solution will probably be more suitable.\nPrice-conscious customers: Always-on services tend to be more expensive due to the added traffic surcharges and additional overhead incurred by the service providers. Therefore, customers who have a limited budget might consider an on-demand service.\n\nThe always-on model provides effective protection for applications which require constant protection against DDoS attacks, and cannot afford any downtime at all. However, this added security comes at the cost of some added latency.\nFor customers and applications which need both constant protection and low latency, a hybrid solution combining both premise-based equipment and scalable cloud service is the best option. The final installment of this blog series will cover the hybrid DDoS protection model and the use-cases for which it is best suited.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/04/choosing-ddos-solution-always-on-cloud-service/');

With more and more VoIP applications that use SIP as their signalling protocol being developed these days, the industry should put greater emphasis on safeguarding SIP assets against undesirable exploitations that may either degrade the quality of VoIP services or promote cyber-crime.\n\n\nIn converged network architecture, data and voice reside together on the same media and this is the reason why the architecture becomes vulnerable to multi-layered security threats. On the first level, such threats may come in the form of native DoS, DDoS and network scan attacks and the Malicious RTP Streams flood attack. On the second level, attack vectors exploit vulnerabilities existing in the TCP stacks of SIP servers. These threats can cause devastating impacts on SIP over TCP as attack vectors, such as TCP SYN attacks and TCP established connections floods, can easily exhaust the TCP resources of the client or server. Unfortunately, most of the existing security products fail to detect and prevent such threats in an effective manner. The third layer of risks impact the application layer that is vulnerable to specific SIP application attack vectors. SIP servers are vulnerable to attacks such as SIP server flooding that may lead to server crash, SIP Client Call Flooding that produces damaging impacts on SIP servers and client phones, and SIP brute-force and Scanning Attacks that have the potential to expose confidential information such as the server’s application and user details.\n [You might also like: Choosing the Right DDoS Solution – Part I: On-Prem Appliance]\nFortunately, the IT landscape is evolving continuously and new security products, with stronger capabilities, are getting introduced.

Such solutions typically come with pre-attack network probes.\nVoIP security solutions are meant to protect the internal network security components such as host-based security solutions, firewalls, and mail and web security products.\nThe second layer of VoIP defense should include behavioral as well as content-based protections.

The first part of this series covered the premise-based DDoS mitigation appliance. This installment will provide an overview of on-demand cloud-based solutions. Subsequent chapters will also cover always-on and hybrid solutions.\n\n\nAdvantages of moving to the cloud\nThere are numerous advantages for moving to the cloud compared to deploying a standalone hardware device:\n\nProtecting cloud-based applications: Applications that are hosted in the cloud cannot be protected by premise-based equipment, and therefore require cloud-based protection.\nLarger capacity: As volumetric DDoS attacks become increasingly bigger, many attacks can easily surpass the capacity of typical enterprise-grade DDoS mitigation appliances. In such cases, a cloud service will be able to provide backup capacity that can absorb these attacks.\nLower management: Using a cloud-service frequently requires less management overhead and staff than a premise-based device.\nLower cost: Whereas DDoS mitigation appliances require large upfront capital costs (CAPEX), cloud-based DDoS mitigation services tend to be lower cost, and can be paid for in an on-going subscription model. This allows the customer to expand (or contract) their service based on their needs. Moreover, such expenditures are usually classified as operating expenses (OPEX), which for many companies are easier to allocate.\nHowever, it should be noted that the convenience of the cloud is tapered by the lower level of control, as well as potential conflict with regulatory requirements that may limit the organizationâs ability to migrate to the cloud.\n\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nOn-Demand: DDoS protection when you need it\nThe first model of cloud-based DDoS protection is the On-Demand model. Under an on-demand model, traffic flows normally directly to the host in peacetime (i.e., when not under attack). However, once a DDoS attack is identified, traffic is re-routed to the cloud DDoS mitigation service, which scrubs the attack traffic and passes only clean traffic to the origin server. As its name implies, this type of protection is activated â on-demand â only in times of need.\nAdvantages and drawbacks:\n\nNo latency in peacetime: One of the big advantages of an on-demand service is that there is no latency during âpeacetimeâ when you are not under attack. Traffic is diverted only during times of attack, for the attack duration.\nLower cost: On-demand services tend to be cheaper than purchasing a dedicated DDoS mitigation appliance, as well as always-on cloud services. This allows for effective protection for customers who donât have a large budget.\nSimplicity: On-demand cloud-based services are simple to maintain and require no management during normal times.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nHowever, there are certain drawbacks to the on-demand model:\n\nDetection time: Perhaps the biggest drawback of an on-demand service is that it does not provide protection 100% of the time. Most on-demand services detect DDoS attacks based on volumetric traffic thresholds. Protection will be activated only once a certain traffic threshold is reached, which may take a few minutes to accumulate data and analyze. During this time the server might be exposed.\nDiversion time: After diversion is initiated, it may take some more time until diversion is complete. Diversion time consists of two factors: the time it takes to initiate the diversion to begin with, and the time it takes for diversion to propagate through BGP or DNS tables. While diversion time can be minimized using automatic or programmatic (API-based) diversion techniques, propagation time is usually outside of the providerâs direct control.\nLatency during diversion: Once traffic has been diverted, all requests to the origin server flow through the network of the cloud DDoS mitigation provider, which may add some latency to transactions. The amount of latency can depend on location of the scrubbing center, distance from the origin server, and the quality of connectivity. However, this latency continues only while diversion is taking place, and returns to normal once diversion is over.\n\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nConsiderations:\nLike purchasing a premise-based device (as well as the always-on and hybrid models, which will be covered next), the choice of whether or not to use an on-demand protection model depends on the organizationâs particular use case and needs:\n\nLatency: Using an on-demand service does not incur additional latency in peacetime, so for latency-sensitive applications, an on-demand service might be effective.\nFrequency of attack: How frequently are you attacked? If you are only infrequently attacked (or not at all), then an on-demand service might be a cost-effective solution to protect you in a rainy day. However, if your server comes under constant attack, then it is probably not very effective to be constantly diverting traffic, and an always-on or hybrid service might be better.\nMission-critical applications: Is your application mission-critical? On-demand services usually take a few minutes for the detection and diversion steps, during which time the server remains exposed. If you can absorb this exposure without causing major harm, then an on-demand service will be fine. However, if you cannot afford even one moment of downtime, then perhaps an always-on or hybrid solution would be better.\n\nWho Is It Best For?\nConsidering the relative merits and drawbacks of the cloud on-demand DDoS protection model, there are a several types of customers (or applications) for whom this model makes sense:\n\nInfrequently attacked: Companies who are not frequently attacked and do not need constant coverage.\nLatency sensitive: Applications that are very sensitive to latency and therefore an always-on solution will not be suitable.\nPrice sensitive: Organizations that do not have a large budget to spend on DDoS protection and wish to have cost-effective protection.\n\nHowever, similarly, there are certain organizations and application types for whom this solution is less suited:\n\nConstantly attacked: Organizations or applications that constantly come under attack, resulting in traffic being constantly diverted. In those cases, an always-on or a hybrid solution will be probably be more suitable.\nMission-critical applications: Mission-critical applications must always be available and cannot afford any downtime at all. Since on-demand DDoS protection usually takes a few minutes to detect and divert, this may result in short interruptions to availability. If this is a major issue, then perhaps an always-on or hybrid solution will be better.\n\nThe on-demand cloud DDoS protection model is a cost-effective solution for organizations who do not require constant protection. For customers who do require such constant protection, there are cloud always-on and hybrid solutions, which do offer this type of protection.

MikroTik, a Latvian hardware manufacturer, products are used around the world and are now a target of a new propagating botnet exploiting vulnerabilities in their RouterOS operating system, allowing attackers to remotely execute code on the device. Such devices have been making unaccounted outbound winbox connections. Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) has spotted an increase in malicious activity following Kaspersky’s publication about the Slingshot APT malware that infected Mikrotik routers. It is believed this botnet is part of the Hajime botnet. Radware is witnessing the spreading mechanism going beyond port 8291 into others and rapidly infecting other devices other than MikroTik (such as AirOS/Ubiquiti). The concern is that this new botnet will be leveraged to launch DDoS attacks.

So, if you think of these limits, and the verification processes, you may NOT be able to purchase enough Bitcoin to pay a ransom.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nSo, with that, you may have to ask: When Uber lost 57 million passengers’ data and silently paid, did Uber pay $100,000 in Bitcoin? The answer could be that they would have had to stockpile Bitcoin in the event that they needed to pay the ransom.  Research studies have been published that 33% of organizations are stockpiling bitcoin to pay ransoms. Two years ago, Radware’s Emergency Response Team Report found 7% of organizations were stockpiling cryptocurrencies to pay for ransoms.\nOne of the difficulties that WannaCry had last year was customer service. Because of the size and magnitude of infection of WannaCry, it was considered a large failure for the hackers to monetize because of the difficulty of buying cryptocurrencies. This could also be a large factor in the increase of companies buying and stockpiling cryptocurrencies to pay ransoms.\nA month after WannaCry, the same vulnerability was exploited in Linux-based computers running un-patched Samba services. This new exploit based on WannaCry was called Eternal Miner. It was designed to NOT encrypt the hard drive and send a ransom note. Instead, it just made the machines mine a more anonymous cryptocurrency known as Monero. This simplified the process of monetization and eliminated the need to do customer support in teaching the victims how to buy cryptocurrency and send it to the criminals. Since then, we have seen over 500,000 unpatched Windows computers joined onto the Smominru botnet which has earned the hackers over $3.6 Million USD.  So, using the same vulnerability to fumble out $170,000 turns to $3.6 million when the tactic changes to cut out the end user here.\n [You might also like: The Current Surge of Bitcoin Prices]\nNow, it’s become very commonplace for the hackers to utilize compute resources today instead of the old-fashioned ransomware virus. We’ve seen the “CoinHive” JavaScript hijack browsers around the world, and some shady ISPs inject this code into data streams to make extra money. This is the change of the landscape from 2017 to 2018. The regulation of bitcoin and crypto-trading has made it much more challenging for hackers to bring their ill-gotten gains back to fiat currency.\nBitcoin’s underpinning blockchain technology was initially designed to record transactions on the public ledger. The digital ledger also stores addresses of the sender and receiver of a payment with the exact time. Investigators have developed databases and tactics to use this data to tackle criminal activities.\nMonero, created in 2014, encrypts addresses and produces fake addresses to shroud the sender. Additionally, the cryptocurrency feature can also conceal the amount of the transaction. Hence, providing a safe haven for wrongdoers and regular privacy-minded users alike.\nBecause of this difference, the hacking and Darknet communities have switched to favoring Monero. With this change, it definitely is going to make tracking criminals much harder in the near future.   Law enforcement worldwide will now have to focus more on money laundering. This may be part of the reason why the regulators are looking to track the crypto-exchange activities, as getting record of trade activity is going to be one of the ways to identify criminals.  The next couple of years are going to be interesting as we watch these changes in regulation weave into investment platforms and assist law enforcement. The rollercoasters of the markets will probably continue as we see these scenarios play out.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'Blockchain\', \'cryptocurrency\', \'Hackers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/03/cryptocurrency-legitimacy-has-made-it-harder-for-hackers/');

This automation frees information technology folk to focus on other tasks. Currently, such bots generate more than half of the internet traffic, but unfortunately every evolution brings with it some form of abuse. Various ‘bad’ bots aim to achieve different goals, among which are web scraping, web application DDoS and clickjacking. While simple script-based bots are not much of a challenge to detect and block, advanced bots dramatically complicate the mitigation process using techniques such as mimicking user behavior, using dynamic IP addresses, operating behind anonymous proxies and CDNs, etc.\nCaptcha means “Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”.\n\n\nAs bots are growing in sophistication, they are a complex threat for many site operators. Solutions in the market today leverage several techniques that each has its own limitations, in particular those that are based on IPs like blacklisting. Others include challenges during the handshake but these can be tricked too. In websites, one of the most popular forms of making a distinction between bots and human is captcha. Unfortunately, it does not deliver the required level of protection compared to the more advanced device fingerprinting approach.\n [You might also like: Has Cyber Security Reached Its Limits?]\nIs Captcha Failing the Test?\n\nLet’s try and look at it from a bot’s point of view. If I am a bot and I want to bypass a fingerprint mechanism, the effort is much greater and complex than bypassing a captcha.  First, captcha requires human intervention and cooperation. We all know how unpleasant captcha can be – sometimes we must answer a question by clicking pictures, by typing a word or numbers that have been distorted, or even sometimes by typing a word heard from a soundtrack. Bots become more and more sophisticated and use new technologies to bypass captcha, like speech-to-text technology that write the word played on a soundtrack. A little over a year ago, Google presented reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is more resilient than the classic captcha, however it still requires human interaction (to check the “I’m not a robot” box), and also has limitations in some use cases. reCAPTCHA is presented as though the request is coming from a legitimate user and not a bot. Multiple factors are used to identify the bot before presenting the reCAPTCHA: Number of reCAPTCHA per domain / per browser, simultaneous requests per day and more).  And then the reCAPTCHA is presented.\nNot only does the human interaction slow down the communication and possibly lead to false positives, but both contribute to a bad customer experience, which is the last thing a website owner wants.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nNo User Interaction\nThe device fingerprint is a transparent mechanism that does not require any user interaction. It can be used early in the process as a detection mechanism rather than only as a mitigation/escalation mechanism during a bot attack. To uniquely identify an attack source (and create a fingerprint) the first step would be a JS challenge-response. Let’s imagine that the bot does not answer the challenge, then the fingerprint mechanism will immediately block the bot. If the bot is sophisticated enough to answer the challenge simulating a human behavior, the challenge will provide cues that every user unwittingly provides. These cues are compiled to provide a unique fingerprint that will identify the source and track its activity. All of the cues are very hard to spoof. Only the high-end, most sophisticated bots can reproduce real human behavior such as mouse movement or keyboard typing.\nCaptcha doesn’t challenge the source – it only adds a manual step to pass the security. As explained above, bots today can easily bypass captcha. A very simple Internet search will present websites where anyone can buy tools to bypass it. The transparent device fingerprint tracks sources and fully protects against malicious activity. Source activity tracking that is only based on an IP address usually leads to a high false positives rate, since bots can dynamically change their IP addresses, and evade solutions that rely on signatures or another form of IP-based filtering. The challenge mechanism identifies the source uniquely.\n [You might also like: IT Can Be a Creepy Clown: Five Things That Keep Me Up At Night]\nBot Management Requires Revealing the True Identity\nDevice fingerprinting will block the vast majority of the bots, just because they cannot respond to the challenge. Bots that pass the fingerprinting mechanism (like ‘good’ bots such as Google’s crawler for instance), will be tracked based on their behavioral attributes, to detect and block them if turned out to be engaged in malicious activity. For this purpose, each source (a single HTTP client identified by the fingerprinting algorithm) gets a certain score according to its conduct. The fingerprint is necessary not only to determine whether a certain request is human vs. a bot, it is also required in cases of fraud attempts to point at a real user vs. stolen account credentials.\nA combination of challenging the bot, device fingerprinting and activity tracking provide a successful bot management and accurate bot-attack mitigation.\nDevice Fingerprinting allows unique source identification, which contributes to detection accuracy. It mitigates multiple attack types: HTTP parsing, SQL Injection, XSS, Brute Force, Session hijacking and DDOS Layer 7 attacks like SlowLoris and others.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Bots\', \'captcha\', \'device fingerprinting\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/03/captcha-limitations-bot-mitigation/');

Each option has its unique advantages and drawbacks, and it is up to the customer to select the optimal solution that best fits their needs, threats, and budget.\nThis blog series explores the various options for DDoS protection deployments and discusses the considerations, advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and who it is usually best suited for.\n\nThe first installment in the series focuses on the original form of DDoS mitigation â the premise-based appliance. Subsequent installments will focus on cloud and hybrid deployments.\n\nThe Original DDoS Protection\nPremise-based appliances were the first form of DDoS protection, starting in the early 2000âs in response to the first generation of DDoS attacks. These devices were deployed on-site at customer data centers alongside other networking equipment such as firewalls, switches and routers.\nAlthough many organizations are now migrating to cloud-based DDoS protection, the usage of DDoS mitigation appliances is still very prevalent, and can be found in a multitude of organizations and use-cases.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nAdvantages & Drawbacks:\n\nLow latency: One of the key advantages of the premise-based appliance is the low latency that it permits. The device is located directly in the data center, close to the application servers, with minimal or no latency. Moreover, some on-prem appliances can also be deployed in out-of-path deployments and activated during times of attack, meaning there is no added latency at all during peacetime.\nControl: Another key reason for selecting a premise-based DDoS protection device is control. Many organizations (and network managers) put a high premium on control, and having your own device directly in the data center allows for maximum control.\nRegulation: Finally, some organizations are in regulated industries such as healthcare or finance, and are constrained by industry regulations to migrate their IT workloads to the cloud.\n\nHowever, there are also certain drawbacks to deploying a premise-based appliance:\n\nCost: A key consideration for many organization is their available budget for a DDoS mitigation solution. A cost of a DDoS mitigation appliance can range from several tens of thousands of dollars for an entry-level device to hundreds of thousands of dollars for carrier-grade devices. Moreover, there are frequently associated costs for support and maintenance, as well as dedicated staff needed to manage the equipment, which may impact the overall TCO.\nManagement overhead: With great responsibility also comes additional overhead. Premise-based equipment frequently requires dedicated staff to manage the devices, in addition to utilities overhead such as power, networking, and cooling.\nCapacity: While DDoS attacks continue to increase in size, premise-based DDoS appliances are constrained by their size and available bandwidth that they can handle.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nConsiderations: Questions to Ask Yourself\nIf you are considering deploying â or removing â a premise-based appliance, here are a few questions to ask yourself if it is the right choice for you.\n\nWhat are my data center plans? Many organizations are migrating their data center workloads to cloud-based deployments. The decision of whether to invest in new equipment heavily depends on this consideration. However, if you know for sure that you are planning to maintain your physical data center for the foreseeable future, then perhaps a DDoS mitigation appliance could be worthwhile.\nHow important is control for me? Some organizations place a big emphasis on control, while others prefer that others handle the burden. A physical device will provide you with more control, but will also require additional overhead.\nHow sensitive am I to latency? Another key consideration is the sensitivity of the organization and its applications to latency. Cloud-based services tend to add latency to application traffic, so if latency is a big issue, then an on-prem solution â either deployed inline or out-of-path â might be relevant.\nAm I in a regulated industry? Some organizations are within regulated industries that handle sensitive user data, and are prevented from â or prefer not to â migrate services to the cloud. In such cases, there may not be an alternative to having an on-prem appliance.\nWhat is my threat profile? The choice of whether or not a DDoS appliance is right for you depends heavily on the companyâs threat profile. If a company is constantly attacked with a stream of low-level DDoS attacks, then an on-prem appliance might be an effective solution. However, if they face large-scale volumetric attacks, then perhaps a cloud-based or a hybrid solution would be better.\nWhat is the TCO? Finally, when selecting a premise-based solution, it is important to be cognizant of the full cost of ownership (TCO), including added overhead, infrastructure, support, staff and training.\n\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nWho Is It Best For?\nLooking at the relative merits and drawbacks of standalone, on-prem DDoS appliances, there are a several categories of customers for whom it makes sense to explore such solutions:\n\nService providers who have a large install base and provide services to end-customers using their data centers\nOrganizations who own existing data centers and are planning on maintaining them in the foreseeable future\nOrganizations in regulated industries who are unable to migrate workloads to the cloud\nLatency-sensitive critical applications which require low latency and high degree of control\n\nHowever, standalone on-prem solutions are probably less suited for:\n\nApplications hosted in the cloud which cannot be protected by premise-based equipment\nOrganizations migrating to the cloud that are planning to scale down their data center footprint\nPrice-sensitive customers who donât have large budgets\nOrganizations frequently attacked with large volumetric attacks which can saturate the connection pipe or overwhelm the device\n\nWhat Are My Alternatives?\nWhether or not you think that an on-prem DDoS appliance is the right solution for you, it is worthwhile to understand your alternatives. The next installments of this series will look at cloud-based solutions (both on-demand and always-on) and hybrid solutions, which combine both on-prem and cloud components for maximal coverage.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/03/choosing-ddos-solution-on-prem-appliance/');

With these record-breaking attacks we can officially say that we have entered the era of Terabit Denial-of-Service attacks.\nThe first attack ever to break the 1Tbps mark was an attack against French hosting provider OVH in 2016. This attack was able to break the 1Tbps barrier by infecting hundreds of thousands of IoT devices with a piece of malware called Mirai. Mirai was successfully leveraged at the time with a number of attack vectors to generate enough volume to claim the world record and escalate DDoS attacks to a new level.\n [You might also like: A Quick History of IoT Botnets]\nIoT Botnet Evolution\nThe Mirai botnet was the culmination of years of IoT botnet evolution.  In 2012 an IRC-based mass router scanner and exploiter called Aidra was released that utilized two servers, one to host the binaries and the other, an IRC server, used to issue commands to devices infected via telnet. Shortly after Aidra, Bashlite, also known as Qbot, Lizkebab and Gafgyt, was discovered in 2014 with a new twist. This IoT botnet utilized the ShellShock vulnerability to infect IoT devices. But shortly after Bashlite, in 2016, a new IoT botnet was discovered and struck the security industry with three massive DDoS attacks that shook the traditional protection paradigms.\nThis botnet was the first version of Mirai, a powerful and sophisticated attack tool. Mirai gained infamy in 2016 when it was leveraged in the first DDoS attack to exceed 1Tbps of traffic volume. Mirai was responsible for the top three attacks that year, targeting Brian Krebs, OVH and DynDNS. Once the source code for Mirai became public it empowered script-kiddies from all over the world to customize the code and create new variations.\nThe original Mirai botnet featured ten predefined attack vectors including common attacks such as SYN and ACK floods that have proven effective in previous attacks.  Mirai introduced new DDoS vectors like GRE IP and Ethernet floods. Mirai also featured intelligent evasion mechanisms to bypass known security controls and DDoS mitigation methods before reaching its target, providing a challenge for some organizations. Mirai did not leverage an exploit like ShellShock used by Bashlite. It leveraged a simple attack of targeting insecure devices with default credentials via telnet and SSH.\nIoT botnets became an attractive toolkit for attackers for several reasons. The main reason why an IoT botnet is favored over a standard botnet is due to availability. Standard botnets are comprised of infected PCs that are not always on. With IoT devices, they are left operating 24/7 year round. This allows an attacker who is leveraging an IoT botnet to have 100% service availability from infected devices. There is also no regulations or standards for securing IoT devices, leaving millions of devices exposed with default credentials.\nAfter hitting the 1Tbps mark, IoT devices became all the rage and the once-popular, amplified attack took a back seat to large-scale IoT botnets as attackers zeroed in on the most insecure areas in the cyber landscape – IoT devices.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nMemcached\nAfter two years of Mirai, UDP amplification attacks came back into the mainstream with the release of the Memcached amplified attack vector. This vector makes use of legitimate third party Memcached servers to send spoofed attack traffic to a targeted victim. Memcached, like other UDP-based services (SSDP, DNS and NTP), are internet servers that do not have native authentication and are therefore easily hijacked to launch amplified attacks against their victims.\nMemcached is a general-purpose, distributed memory caching system typically used to speed up dynamic web applications by caching data and objects in RAM. This reduced the backend database or API round trips but also created a problem with the way Memcached’s UDP protocol is implemented. Memcached can be compiled with optional SASL authentication support but was deployed with TCP/UDP port 11211 exposed to the Internet. As a result, attackers can abuse this service to launch large-scale amplified attacks.\nAll the attacker has to do is scan the internet for vulnerable Memcached servers to create an amplification list. In fact, today they don’t even need to do this. They can simply search a number of public sources like PasteBin to find a public amplification list. Once the attacker has a Memcached amplification list they are able to use a simple script to send spoofed requests to UDP port 11211 with the victim’s spoofed IP address. The Memcached servers will respond to the request by sending an amplified request, vastly larger than the original request, to the victim’s IP address. The result is pipe saturation and service degradation for the targeted organization.\nDue to the volume that can be reached with a single amplification list, attackers do not need a massive IoT botnet to launch 1Tbps+ assaults as with Mirai. At the core of the Memcached problem is the number of exposed servers on the Internet. With just under 100,000 exposed Memcached servers, it creates a prime reflector for an amplified attack.\n [You might also like: A Quick History of IoT Botnets]\nWhat Do We Need to Be Concerned About?\nThere are two main concerns in regards to the Memcached vulnerability. The first issue is centered around the number of exposed Memcached servers. With just under 40,000 vulnerable servers and only a few thousand required to launch large scale volumetric attacks, the cause for concern is great. Some organizations are likely still unaware that they have exposed Memcached servers exposed to the internet and it will take time to block or filter this service. Memcached servers will be vulnerable for some time, allowing attackers to generate volumetric attacks with few resources.\nThe second concern is the time it took attackers to begin exploiting this vulnerability. The spike in activity was known for several days prior to the patch and publication of the Memcached vulnerability. Within 24 hours of publication, attackers were able to build an amplification list of vulnerable Memcached servers and launch multiple record breaking DDoS attack, a title previously held by the Mirai botnet.\nWhat Now?\nMemcached has reminded everyone in the industry that what’s old is new again. Once we get used to a threat and can properly mitigate it, attackers will quickly look for a new vector which will gain the desired results, and incorporate it into their attack toolkit. In fact, the DDoS-as-a-Service industry has incorporated the Memcache attack vector into their stresser service. These for-profit criminals are quick to utilize the newest vector for many reasons. The first reason a criminal would include this attack vector into their stesser is due to hype and public attention. The first one to incorporate it could expect to see a growth in subscribers because of it. They will also provide a bigger bang for their customers’ buck. Currently most stresser services cost around $20 a month and allow the user to launch one attack at a time for 1,200 seconds. To impound the problem, ransom groups will likely start sending out letters threatening a 1Tbps attack for Bitcoin, as was seen directly after the release of Mirai. Attackers prey off the fear of the public and with Memcached in the spotlight, its likely it’s only a matter of time before RDoS groups start using Memcached as a threat for their campaign.\nTo prevent this problem from expanding, I suggest that users with Memcached servers should disable UDP, update to the latest code version of Memcached, 1.5.6 or enable SAML authentication.\nIf faced with a RDoS attack do not pay the attacker, as often times they reuse the same payment address, making it difficult to determined who paid the ransom. RDoS groups in 2017 rarely follow through with their threats with the exception of an occasional sample attack after receiving the letter.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'IoT\', \'Memecached\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/03/entering-the-1tbps-era/');

So without DDoS protection that can distinguish legitimate traffic from bad, it is not uncommon for DDoS attacks to go unnoticed and instead blight customer experience in cloud environments just as they do in traditional physical data centres. A number of the below points expand on the where’s and how’s of this key consideration.\n DDoS infrastructure pains are different between traditional data centres and cloud – In traditional physical data centre environments all DDoS payload targeting base infrastructure becomes a potential customer experience and economic hit against capacity assumptions. Into cloud environments this pattern changes. For starters, attacks against the underlying infrastructure before the customer’s front-end apps are generally dealt with by the cloud service provider. There are recorded outages where cloud service providers have not got things entirely right of course, such as the 2016 Dyn attack, but such incidents remain exceptions to the rule for now.  The upshot of in-built protection is that customers do not normally feel the burn of poor user experience or the bill of DDoS attacks hitting shared internet connectivity or APIs.  However, when the attack gets into the customer’s personal compute domain, the pain occurs.  The user experience degradation is discussed below, focusing now on economic impacts that can vary both within a service and between the different providers.  For example, AWS does not bill you for ingress traffic into an Elastic Load Balancer, you just pay for the egress traffic, however if the DDoS traffic is getting NATed then you would be paying $0.050 per GB processed for the inbound traffic.  Obviously when a front-end web application starts to take a hit, then it is only the severity of cost that is variable.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\n Lift and shift of traditional data centre to cloud renders auto-scalability virtually useless to fend off DDoS attacks – If a customer takes their traditional data centre footprint into a cloud environment without transformation, then they will inevitably be lifting the majority of their previous capacity ceilings into their new cloud home. Into an attack the customer would be almost assured of hitting a limitation in licensing, O/S threshold, messaging queue or some other interlink between front-end and back-end applications that would cause an outage or major service degradation that no end of horizontal auto-scaling or virtual RAM and CPU resources could mitigate. In one sense this scaling failure might protect them from the worst of a so-called Economic Denial-of-Service attack, EDoS, AKA a huge bill.  Not something to applaud of course.\n Excess billing prevention is on you – The major cloud providers simply do not provide utilisation caps. It is not that doing so is contra revenue interests (which it is of course), but as much they don’t want to be the party that brings their customer’s house down due to their involvement in the automatic shutdown of service. For this reason it is down to the end users to define the thresholds for dollar spend alerts to somehow then run countermeasures to limit the economic blast radius of an EDoS attack.  For instance, since 2012 Amazon has had functionality which allows customers to get an aggregate view on their billing across services (S3, EC2, etc.) and set alert thresholds around these.  Obviously it is on you to determine exactly what you do with the alerts.\n Cloud-architected applications is the road to infinite billing – Customers that have gone through the cloud transformation playbook face the nemesis of infinite cloud scale: infinite cloud billing. Stripping back an environment from the traditional limits of scalability in favor of cloud-built apps quite simply takes the gloves off a DDoS attack to economically hurt. For this reason such organizations embarking on this transformative cloud journey would have received the very sound advice of cloud migration experts and a multitude of best practice whitepapers to purchase effective DDoS protection.  If they had not taken heed then the clock is ticking to face down the bill caused by the insatiable demand of an IoT botnet!\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\n Knowledge is power, metrics matter – Organizations that take their cloud play highly seriously are some of the most probable organizations to be leveraging an understanding of utilisation to drive a better understanding of customer experience and predicting forward demand for their products. A so-called Data Driven Company. In stark example, a streaming service like Netflix would be measuring the volume of video commencements,  the logic being that a higher than normal ratio of commences could indicate a service issue with frustrated users attempting to recommence content on initial failure.  It is not difficult to understand that a DDoS attack into the service left unmitigated could completely throw off such metrics and the value they have towards the company bottom line.\n Auto-scaling combined with pulse attacks is the primary pain for both economic and experience impacts – One of the key trends Radware sees is around pulse attacks, whereby organizations endure multi-vector attacks that oscillate between volumetric and application layer in short periods of time that leave no room for infrastructure to recover or manual countermeasures to be formed. Think of how such burst attacks play out against auto-scaling triggers, even if the organization has DDoS technology. The technology would need to be able to detect and mitigate attacks in seconds to prevent auto-scaling triggers firing. Fleets of virtual servers coming online automatically, remaining up for a period of time and then shutting down again when load disappeared.  You are left thinking about the unnecessary bills caused by mass over-provisioning – which would certainly add up. However, more seriously, what are the implications for customer experience and the management overheads for supervising services coming online and going offline in high frequency.  Most organizations would expect that service goes into overdrive just once or twice a day to meet variable demand, what if that was happening +500 times a day?  The organizations I’ve heard about that have encountered this scenario were proud of how they fought off 48-hour attacks through the determined efforts of DevOps staff to keep putting plugs in the dam to limit the billing blast radius.  But into campaigns that go on much longer, the distraction for the ICT org is irrefutably highly problematic without highly effective DDoS mitigation technology.\n\nIn summing up, cloud computing provides no assurance that inherent scalability can mitigate against DDoS attacks. The pain could be service outage, user experience degradation or unnecessary reoccurring spend and the only viable mitigation is DDoS technology that is as automated enough to cope.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'data centers\', \'ddos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/03/cloud-vs-ddos-seven-layers-of-complexity/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (40, 'A Quick History of IoT Botnets', 'Radware', '2018-3-1', 'The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a world where just about anything is an Internet-enabled device. IoT is comprised of smart physical objects such as vehicles and buildings or embedded devices such as refrigerators, toasters and routers. These devices feature sensors and an IP address for Internet connectivity, enabling these objects to collect and exchange data while allowing users the ability to automate or control their devices.\n\nCurrently, more things are connected to the Internet than people. According to Gartner, there are approximately 6.4 billion connected devices in use worldwide (2016), estimated to reach 20 billion by 2020.1 A staggering number that exponentially expands a hacker’s field of attack.\n\nThe Botnet Evolution\nWith the number of IoT devices dramatically accelerating, there is corresponding increase in the number of botnets and cyber-attacks. Let’s take a look at botnets: traditional and IoT.\n\nTraditional Botnets: A traditional botnet is a collection of compromised computers or servers, often referred to as zombies, infected with malware that allows an attacker to control them, carrying out tasks on their behalf. Botnet owners or herders are able to control these infected machines in the botnet by means of a covert channel such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) or peer-to-peer. These control methods issue commands to perform malicious activities such as distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spam mail or information theft.\nIoT Botnets: An IoT botnet is a collection of compromised IoT devices, such as cameras, routers, DVRs, wearables and other embedded technologies, infected with malware. This malware allows an attacker to control the devices, carrying out tasks just like a traditional botnet. Unlike traditional botnets, infected IoT devices seek to spread their malware, persistently targeting more and more devices. While a traditional botnet may consist of thousands or tens of thousands of devices, an IoT botnet is larger in scale, with hundreds of thousands of compromised devices.\n\nThe Impact\nAs IoT botnets continue to grow, they are being leveraged to launch DDoS attacks. Because IoT devices are Linux and Unix-based systems, they often are targets of executable and linkable format (ELF) binaries, a common file format found in embedded systems’ firmware (see Figure 1). The malware delivery method typically targets SSH or Telnet network protocols by exploiting default, hardcoded credentials or simply brute-forcing techniques. Once compromised, the malware payload is delivered to the device for enrollment into the botnet.\nFigure 1: Example of format (ELF) binaries\nBecause IoT devices are “always on” (24/7/365) and ready to go, an IoT “bot herder” can build and deploy large- scale attacks within minutes, such as a massive 1Tbps DDoS attack.\n [You might also like: Create Trusted IoT, become the King of Sweden?]\nTypes of IoT Botnets\nBecause IoT includes a vast and ever-growing array of networked devices (e.g., smart meters, medical devices, public safety sensors, etc.), many IoT botnets such as Aidra, Bashlite and Mirai can utilize scanners designed to locate exposed ports and default credentials on these devices (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Default passwords\nHere’s a sample of some large scale IoT botnet attacks:\n\nLinux.Aidra – Also known as Linux.Lightaidra, this botnet was discovered in 2012 by security researchers at ATMA.ES. It was first noticed when researchers witnessed a large number of Telnet-based attacks on IoT devices.\nBashlite – Also known as Gayfgt, Qbot, Lizkebab and Torlus, this IoT botnet was discovered in 2014 with the Bashlite source code published (with several variants) in 2015. Some variants of this botnet reached over 100,000 infected devices, serving as the precursor to Mirai (see below).\nMirai – Gaining worldwide attention in 2016, the Mirai botnet consisted of record-breaking DDoS attacks on Krebs, OVH and Dyn. The botnet, which targeted closed-circuit television cameras, routers and DVRs, generated traffic volumes above 1Tbps. Featuring ten pre-defined attack vectors, this botnet took down the infrastructure of service providers and cloud scrubbers. Some of the vectors include GRE floods and Water Torture attacks.\nLinux/IRCTelnet – Discovered in 2016 by Malware Must Die, this IoT botnet targets routers, DVRs and IP cameras. It can send UDP and TCP floods along with other methods in both Ipv4 and Ipv6 protocols.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nWhy IoT Botnets?\nThere are a number of critical reasons attackers target IoT devices.\n\nLow-hanging fruit as embedded devices are easily exploited (e.g., default credentials, exposed services)\nAlways-on devices with 24/7/365 availability and explosive marketplace growth\nOff-the-shelf products with low security standards (often root:root and admin:admin since few end users change this nomenclature once deployed)\nMalware can easily change default passwords, preventing a user from logging in or other attackers taking control\nDevices are rarely monitored and poorly maintained, allowing hackers to easily shut down or enslave large numbers of IoT devices\nLow cost of entry for attackers as control of thousands of devices can occur for nearly zero cost (i.e., different than the high cost of accessing and controlling servers for more traditional DDoS attacks)\n\nThe Marketplace\nFigure 3: Mirai Setup Service\nSince the publication of IoT botnets such as Bashlite and Mirai, more botnets have emerged, with attackers scanning for new victims to target. Marketplace vendors see financial gain from the work of these hackers, offering IoT botnets for a fee; for example, Mirai for DDoS-as-a-Service. Many notorious DDoS groups have already entered the DDoS-as-a-Service business, monetizing their capabilities by renting out their powerful stresser services. These new, off-the- shelf attack services, for as little as $19.99/month, are commoditizing the art of hacking, making it possible for novice hackers to launch DDoS attacks over 100Gbps.\nVendors of these IoT botnet services are market savvy, utilizing digital marketing such as weekly promotions and Web banners to reach potential buyers (see Figure 3). And they are not stopping with the Clearnet and Darknet, but advertising on social media including Facebook and Twitter (see Figure 4).\nVigilante Hackers\nFigure 4: Social Media Advertisement\nRecently, a number of vigilante hackers have attempted to secure or lockout other bot herders from IoT devices via their own malware. One of the original examples of this was a botnet named Linus.Wifatch, but recently two new vigilante botnets have been discovered. In 2017, Radware’s research team monitored thousands of attempts from Hajime, an alleged vigilante botnet, when it discovered BrickerBot.\n [You might also like: Chatting With IoT Bots]\nLinux.Wifatch\nA group called White Team released a piece of malware in 2014 known as Linux.Wifatch. Designed to infect routers to prevent them from being infected by other IoT botnets, Wifatch is a peer-to-peer botnet that stayed updated of evolving threats so it could attempt to mitigate them as well. It infects devices via Telnet by leveraging default credentials, closes the Telnet session and instructs the owner to login and change their Telnet password and update the firmware.\nHajime\nHajime is a sophisticated, flexible and future-proof IoT botnet. It is capable of updating itself and provides the ability to extend its member bots with ‘richer’ functionality efficiently and fast. The author behind Hajime is another suspected vigilante hacker attempting to secure IoT devices. This is a peer-to-peer botnet that has infected over 300,000 devices to date. Hajime targets devices via Telnet and gains access by brute-forcing default credentials. Hajime was released prior to Mirai but targets devices like routers, DVRs and CCTVs.\nBrickerbot\nEarlier this year, Radware identified a new botnet named BrickerBot. BrickerBot uses a network of globally- distributed devices that passively detect exploit attempts from devices infected with IoT bots such as Mirai. BrickerBot reacts to an exploit attempt by scanning the source of the exploit for a set number of ports in an attempt to secure the device. If it is unable to, BrickerBot launches a permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attack that attempts to brick the infected device by leveraging 90-brick sequences via a Telnet session. As long as an IoT device does not become infected by malware, there should be no reason to fear BrickerBot.\nWhat’s Next?\nAs the IoT botnet attack marketplace continues to grow, and the number of IoT devices continue to proliferate, so will the number of vendors adapting to the changes in their environment. This growth in competition will result in more IoT devices being targeted for profit. Financial gain is the main motivation behind the evolution, driving the growth of the attack marketplace and IoT botnets.\nThe result? Botnets have been involved in nearly every major recent DDoS attack, resulting in service degradation, compromised data, lost revenue and tarnished brands for organizations globally.\nAs the botnet landscape expands and more destructive threats become inevitable, it’s critical to understand these bot-based assaults and move beyond legacy security solutions.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Botnets\', \'Bots\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/uncategorized/2018/03/history-of-iot-botnets/');

Those that evolve with change often help lead the transformation and revolutionize their domain. In 2016 we began to enter the era of digital transformation in our industry and changes have begun to take place that are revolutionizing the way we consume, collect and deliver data to every aspect of society. Along with these changes have we seen the creation of new businesses and opportunities centered around this evolution in connectivity. Digitization is creating growth opportunities and offering user experiences in ways we have never seen before.\n\nThis month I got the opportunity to travel to PyeongChang for the 2018 Winter Olympics. It was here, in the Olympic Village, where the term “digital transformation” really meant something to me for the first time. It’s a term we hear every day in this industry but to stand in the middle of the transformation itself is something words cannot describe.\n\nI grew up in southern California and was able to attend the first Winter X Games in 1997, hosted in Big Bear Lake, California. This at the time was a huge change to the sporting industry as a whole. Categorized as extreme sports, events like ski slopestyle and snowboarding challenged the norm. But today these events have been adopted and welcomed into the Olympics with open arms. I stood there in the Olympic Village looking at how a once fringe sporting event became mainstream. Because the Olympics knew this change was inevitable they transformed with the times and opened up new markets and opportunities. Sponsorships, advertisements, media coverage and even new spectators wanted to see their countries’ athletes compete at a global level, and the Olympics lead this transformation of acceptance.\nBut this wasn’t the moment that caused resignation of the term digital transformation. It was while I was sitting inside the Gangneung Speed Skating oval watching the men’s 1500m final when my parents started messaging me and calling on Facetime. Like any parent, they were excited to relate to someone in the audience. They wanted to know where I was in the arena and what the crowds around me where like. They then began telling me about the first Olympics they had ever been to, the Summer Olympics in 1984, hosted in Los Angeles.\n [You might also like: 2018 Winter Olympics]\nThat’s when the term, “digital transformation,” hit me. In 1984, there was no Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, live streaming virtual reality (VR) services, 360-degree cameras, drones, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors or 5G service. In fact, this was the same year Apple aired their iconic ‘1984’ commercial for the Apple Macintosh, a new computer at the time that utilized a graphic user interface instead of a terminal. This was also the year Dell was founded and five years before Tim Berners-Lee would invent the World Wide Web.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nAfter talking to my parents and doing some research I discovered that the 1984 games were not without technology. IBM had donated over 200 computers and software to the Olympics in order to help organize the games in revolutionary ways. But this year in PyeongChang the Olympics put on a dramatic display of modern technology as they became the leaders of future sporting events. They ushered in new ways that spectators both on scene and around the world engaged with the games.\nSIM card and WiFi egg rental in Korea\nWhen landing in Korea you have a few options when it comes to connectivity at Incheon Airport. I was staying in Seoul and taking the PyeongChang Korail, a high speed KTX train to the games every day. As a New Yorker, a two-hour train ride isn’t much to me but being connected is. Seoul is a very connected city and Wi-Fi is offered in the trains, but for my purposes I decided to rent both a SIM card and hotspot.\nCredentials used on Wi-Fi eggs\nOne of the first things I noticed as I inspected all the devices I was presented with was the weak credentials used on all the Wi-Fi eggs. Every device was serialized with the same SSID and KEY format. Targeting these devices on spectators would have been very simple considering you only had to brute force the last five digits of the targeted eggs’ KEY.\nICT Square, Winter Olympics 2018\nOnce you walk into the Olympic Village you are immediately flooded with IoT sensors, 5G demonstrations and VR viewing of the Olympic games. KT and Intel put on an amazing demonstration of their 5G technology and what sports fans can expect in the near future in regards to real time VR live streaming from the athletes’ point of view, and how IoT sensors will be able to monitor and record athletes’ competitive data in ways never seen before. Technology is clearly the change agent at the Olympics games where events are won by fractions of a second, and the Olympics continues to adapt and evolve with the times by including the latest technology.\nAccess Points at the Gangneung Coastal Cluster\nBefore the opening ceremonies in PyeongChang I decided to go down to the Gangneung Coastal Cluster to passively monitor the access points in the area. After a simple walkthrough of the Olympic Village I had found 1,037 unique access points in the cluster, most of which were running on the 802.11n standard.\n2.5GHz Channels inside Kwandong Hockey Center\nInside the Kwandon Hockey Center there were so many hotspots and access points that service was degraded due to channel interference. This hockey center was the smaller of the two and could accommodate 6,000 spectators. Inside the stadium there were 76 unique access points and dozens of open Bluetooth devices.\n [You might also like: Are You Protected Against Burst Attacks?]\nBut what do the games of the future look like? Digital transformation impacts businesses but also impacts demand and opportunity for sporting events. As the Olympics entertains the idea of including eSports and VR viewing, what will be the risk posed on the new networks and critical applications that are not only dependent on hosting the games but delivering the content to viewers around the world? What are the risk that come with tomorrow? Organizations typically deploy dozens of different security devices and solutions in their network and data centers to host events like the Olympics. Every solution is also another level of security but also increasing the complexity and management of the network exponentially.\nWith this new digital demand and cause for transformation, the games will become more connected than ever before, requiring secure links, IoT security and automated threat detection. Open access points, Bluetooth and other digital services being introduced to the game and smart stadiums will also become the likely vectors of attack for criminals looking to disrupt or steal critical data from the systems. The only negative consequence to the digital transformation is dependencies on new technologies. If these systems are disrupted or unavailable, they will have great impact on the viewing of the games or performance and recording of the athletes. The challenge of effective security in the new connected world is how to manage all the connected devices across several environments.  Security that’s integrated and automated that’s simple to manage will be fundamental to the success of digital businesses in the new world.\nThe best way to protect the future is to dream about the future. Don’t limit yourself. Envision where we will go, what it will include and how it may be delivered so we all can proactively work on a solution that can prevent attacks across multiple environments.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'digital transformation\', \'olympics\', \'security\', \'VR\', \'Winter Olympics\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/02/evolution-of-olympics/');

In recent years, a new attack pattern has emerged. Bursts attacks, also known as hit-and-run DDoS, use repeated short bursts of high-volume attacks at random intervals. Each short burst can last only a few seconds, while a burst attack campaign can span hours or even days. These attacks unleash hundreds of gigabits per second of throughput toward its target.\n\nAccording to our customer base, burst attacks have grown in popularity. Last year, a top-five U.S. carrier witnessed a tenfold increase in burst attacks, where 70% to 80% of attacks were less than a minute long. In a comprehensive survey conducted in 2017, half of the participants cited an increase in burst attacks.\n\nThe Challenge of Protecting Against Burst Attacks\nThe majority of on-premises DDoS protection solutions detect burst attacks, but most of them limit the rate of bad (and legitimate) traffic to a certain threshold, resulting in a high level of false positives. To minimize the level of false positives, security experts need to identify the attack traffic by analyzing traffic captures and manually creating a signature to block only the attack traffic. If the attack vector changes across bursts, the signature needs to adapt to the changing attack characteristics. The process of repeated manual signature adjustments can become a labor-intensive task, which renders the whole protection strategy infeasible.\nSimilarly, most hybrid DDoS protections utilize rate thresholds to trigger a diversion to a cloud DDoS-protection provider or scrubbing center. Still, they suffer from the same high level of false positives, because both the on-premise DDoS gear and scrubbing-center DDoS gear use rate-limit and manual signatures to pinpoint attack traffic and reduce false positives.\n [You might also like: 2017’s 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 2)]\nBehavioral DoS Detection and Mitigation of Burst Attacks\nTo adequately defend against burst attacks, a different approach is required.\nA Behavioral DoS (BDoS) Protection technology should effectively detect and mitigate burst attacks by utilizing machine-learning algorithms. These algorithms can learn normal traffic behaviors, detect traffic anomalies during an attack, automatically create signatures and adapt the protection to mitigate the attack.\nBDoS gathers statistics on various parameters for several protocols, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and IGMP andbuilds a baseline of traffic in peacetime. A detection engine compares real-time statistics with the learned baseline in order to detect attacks.\nAttack detection combines two parameters. The first is rate, the bandwidth of a specific traffic type. The second is rate-invariant, the portion of the specific traffic type out of the entire traffic distribution.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nA fuzzy-logic inference system measures the degree-of-attack (DoA) surface. BDoS considers an attack to have started – and triggers attack handling -only when the overall DoA surface for the combined parameters is high. This guarantees accurate detection of attacks. For example, a high volume of traffic caused by a flash crowd will have a high rate anomaly, but the rate-invariant parameter remains normal. As a result, the combined DoA surface will not cause BDoS to trigger an attack handling. However, if both parameters show an anomalous score, the combined DoA surface will trigger attack handling, and BDoS will start creating a blocking signature in real-time. It takes BDoS 10 to 18 seconds to create a signature.\nBurst attacks, however, which may last only a few seconds, bypass BDoS Protection because there is not enough time to automatically create a blocking signature. This is where Behavioral Burst-Attack Protection comes in.\n [You might also like: Cyber and Securities – Financial Institutions Attack Landscape]\nThe Anatomy of Behavioral Burst-Attack Protection\nBehavioral Burst Attack Protection optimizes BDoS attack detection and characterization.\nFor example, in the burst attack below, there are three bursts, and each one lasts a few seconds.\n\nWhen burst 1 comes in, BDoS detects an attack due to high DoA, and proceeds to characterize the attack to create a blocking signature. Since burst 1 ends after six seconds, no signature has yet been created. During the idle time between burst 1 and burst 2, BDoS caches the state and the parameters it has gathered for the candidate signature, and keeps them for the next burst. When burst 2 comes in, BDoS continues to create the signature from the point at which it stopped, using the cached information. Since burst 2 ends after eight seconds (for a total of 14 seconds), BDoS does not yet finalize signature creation. However, when burst 3 comes in, for a total of eighteen seconds of continuous attack, BDoS finalizes signature creation, and blocks the attack.\nBDoS blocks the subsequent bursts instantaneously since a valid signature is applied throughout the lifespan of the attack.\nBurst attacks change vectors throughout the attack lifespan. This is a great challenge for attack-mitigation strategies, because it involves modifying the blocking signature in real-time across bursts. BDoS continuously monitors the attack traffic and measures the DoA. If the attack changes in such a way that the applied signature is no longer effective (that is, the DOA is high), BDoS fine-tunes the signature to block the mutable burst attack.\nEffective Hybrid DDoS Protection of Burst Attacks\nOn-premise mitigation solutions guarantee in-line protection, but fail to protect against pipe saturation. Only a solution that combines on-premise and in-the-cloud protection against burst attacks ensures attack mitigation that is accurate, real-time, and fully automated.\n\n\nRead the “Behavioral Burst-Attack Protection Whitepaper” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'BDoS\', \'burst attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/02/burst-attack-protection/');

Stealing and selling sensitive data on the Darknet is a lucrative business for hackers, who increasingly rely on evasive malware to penetrate corporate networks.\nA study by Verizon found that over 50% of data breaches involve the usage of malware in some capacity. Indeed, some of the largest and best-known data breaches on record, such as Target, Anthem Health, The Home Depot and the U.S. Federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) were the result of evasive malware running undetected in the network over long periods. These organizations all have large security teams, massive IT budgets and multi-layered anti-malware protections. And yet, in each of these cases these defenses were all circumvented by evasive malware.\n\n\nBuilt to Evade\nThe reason is that modern malwares are engineered to evade traditional anti-malware defenses. Gone are the days of static executable binaries that communicated with a fixed command-&-control (C&C) server over plain text communications. Today’s latest malwares are sophisticated attack tools that include an array of evasion techniques designed to fool, elude, and bypass existing anti-malware defenses.\nSome commonly found evasion techniques found in modern malware include:\n\nPolymorphic (shapeshifting) malware that changes its binary signature very rapidly, thereby evading traditional file scanners.\nFile-less malware such as CodeFork run in run-time memory only and leave no footprint on the host.\nFast-adapting malware such as Nymaim use host spoofing and domain generation algorithms to rapidly change their communication patterns and evade secure web gateways.\nSSL encryption to mask malware communication traffic and bypass data leakage prevention (DLP) mechanisms.\n… And others…\n\nAs a result, customers are increasingly exposed to data breaches caused by undetected evasive malware in their networks, and the inevitable massive financial damage that follows. Many customers are covered by industry regulations such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA and others. For example, PCI-DSS requirements for retail and financial organizations impose a fine of $50-90 per every record of compromised cardholder data. Even for medium-sized breaches, this can quickly reach into millions of dollars in fines. Other sources of financial damage include loss of reputation, civil litigation by breached customers, and loss of future sales.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nMoreover, new regional regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes major financial penalties on organizations that fail to protect personally identifiable information (PII) of EU entities. GDPR penalties can reach as high as €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover – whichever is higher.\nTraditional Defenses are not Enough\nWith the prevalence of evasive malware in the data-theft kill chain, you would expect that existing defenses would prioritize the detection and identification of zero-day malware, in order to block their activity.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nIn reality, however, traditional anti-malware defenses are severely limited in their ability to combat evasive zero-day malware because of constraints on how they are designed and deployed. There are a number of common constraints that are shared by many traditional anti-malware defense layers:\n\nRely on known signatures: Many defenses such as endpoint anti-virus software, email scanners, and content filtering mechanisms rely on signatures of known threats. As a result, they are unable to detect zero-day and emerging threats.\nLimited scope: Most traditional anti-malware defenses are confined to a particular type of asset or network layer. For example, anti-virus software will usually only protect the endpoint, but will not prevent lateral expansion within the network; email malware scanners will protect against infection by phishing emails, but will not detect other methods of entry; and so on.\nInline deployment: Many defenses, such as malware scanners, secure web gateways, next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and others are deployed inline, meaning that for every inspected sample, they must make an immediate, real-time decision of whether to allow or block it. This leaves very little time for deep analysis of the file contents or traffic patterns. Such defenses are careful not to cause interruption to business communications, so unless it conforms to any known signature or pattern, by default it will usually be allowed through.\nLack of context: Finally, many anti-malware mechanisms suffer from lack of context, both of data and time. Most defenses do not have visibility beyond themselves to what is happening in other defenses, what is happening in other organizations, and how threats develop over time. As a result, they lack context to understand how a particular malware sample might tie into other threats seen by other organizations, or how a sample that it is examining now might relate to a different one that it saw months before. This lack of width and breadth of data and time is a severe limitation on the effectiveness of traditional anti-malware in detecting and blocking new malware.\n\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nA New Approach for Blocking Evasive Malware\nRadware launched a new Cloud Malware Protection Service, which is specifically designed to protect organizations against data-stealing evasive malwares.\nRadware’s approach is based on traffic analysis of network browsing data, in order to identify communication anomalies indicative of zero-day and evasive malware.

Plus, Google has sold another 5 million Google Homes.  The overall smart home market is expected to grow to over $50 billion by 2022.  Already 1 in 4 U.S. households has some kind of smart device in their home.  With all the smart thermostats, smart fridges, smart light bulbs, smart doors and windows, personal assistants, and smart home surveillance, internet-connected home devices are rapidly stacking up in U.S. households. These devices are adding convenience and efficiency, but are they safe?\n\n\nIn this realm it seems that the technology has gone quickly beyond our ability to secure it.  At this year’s DefCon, a security-focused industry event, 16 Bluetooth-based smart door locks were tested and 75% were easily hacked in real time during a presentation at the event. Fast forward to the near future where many devices within the home are connected and two very real problems arise.  1) Criminals taking over smart home technology to break in to my house and 2) Criminals using smart home technology to profile my daily behaviors and routines for future nefarious use.\n [You might also like: Create Trusted IoT, become the King of Sweden?]\nEnter the service provider, where 75% of connected home services are sold and managed.  U.S. service providers have stepped into this burgeoning market and begun to re-tool their sales forces and technological capabilities to help consumers set up these complex systems. The U.S. leads this market in smart home penetration, followed by Japan, Germany, China and U.K. Service providers understand that scaling and automating these home networks is key to providing the true value that they represent to consumers. Instead of integrated vendor islands of thermostats, locks and home surveillance cameras, service providers have the capabilities and the capital to create a more complete and seamless experience for the consumer where all devices can work together and are accessed through the same consumer portal for a “single pane of glass” experience.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nBut how to secure it?  Service providers need to make the additional investments to protect the control plane of these devices to prevent bad actors from controlling locks and windows. Just as service providers have seen in their core businesses, failure to do so can result in application attacks which at best reduce the performance of the network and at worst can result in outages and debilitated service for the consumers.  Add that to that the fact that criminals have a new data source to mine for daily patterns of the consumer that service providers need to protect.  Without additional protection on the application data itself, criminals could gather valuable information about your daily habits in the home. What time do you get up in the morning? When do you leave for work?  When do you get home?  What time do the kids watch TV after school? When are you typically in the shower?  What time do you eat?  When do you typically go to bed? You get the idea.  Service providers are well positioned to protect the consumer and offer the value of smart home services without the risks.  U.S. service providers need to act first to capitalize on this opportunity, but the service providers in developed Europe and Asia need to be right behind and prepare for the consumers in their markets. Radware has tools available, like an online calculator, to demonstrate the ROI for service providers to become managed security service providers.  It’s time to prepare before bad actors know when I shower every day.\n\n\nRead “Cyber Economics: Validating DDoS Managed Service Delivery Models” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Hacking\', \'IoT\', \'Service Provider\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/02/smart-homes-iot-2/');

DarkSky features several evasion mechanisms, a malware downloader and a variety of network- and application-layer DDoS attack vectors. This bot is now available for sale for less than $20 over the Darknet.\nAs published by its authors, this malware is capable of running under Windows XP/7/8/10, both x32 and x64 versions, and has anti-virtual machine capabilities to evade security controls such as a sandbox, thereby allowing it to only infect ‘real’ machines.\n\nBackground\nRadware has been monitoring this malware since its early versions in May, 2017. Developers have been enhancing its functionality and released the latest version in December, 2017. Its popularity and use is increasing.\n\nOn New Year’s Day, 2018, Radware witnessed a spike in different variants of the malware. This is suspected to be the result of an increase in sales or testing of the newer version following its launch. However all communication requests were to the same host (“http://injbot.net/”), a strong indication of “testing” samples.\nInfection Methods\nRadware suspects the bot spreads via traditional means of infection such as exploit kits, spear phishing and spam emails.\nCapabilities\n\n Perform DDoS Attack:\n\nThe malware is capable of performing DDoS attacks using several vectors:\n\nDNS Amplification\nTCP (SYN) Flood\nUDP Flood\nHTTP Flood\n\nFigure 2: DarkSky attack panel\nThe server also has a “Check Host Availability” function to check if the DDoS attack succeeded. When the malware performs HTTP DDoS attack, it uses the HTTP structure seen below. In the binaries, Radware witnessed hard-coded lists of User-Agents and Referers that are randomly chosen when crafting the HTTP request.\nFigure 3: HTTP structure\n\n Downloader\n\nThe malware is capable of downloading malicious files from a remote server and executing the downloaded files on the infected machine. After looking at the downloaded files from several different botnets, Radware noticed cryptocurrency-related activity where some of the files are simple Monero cryptocurrency miners and others are the latest version of the “1ms0rry” malware associated with downloading miners and cryptocurrencies.\nFigure 4: Darksky communication to the server\n\n Proxy\n\nThe malware can turn the infected machine to a SOCKS/HTTP proxy to route traffic through the infected machine to a remote server.\n [You might also like: JenX – Los Calvos de San Calvicie]\nMalware Behavior\nThe malware has a quick and silent installation with almost no changes on the infected machine.

Take for example a strong windstorm in Wyoming in February 2017. The storm knocked down power lines, forcing water and sewage treatment plants to operate on backup generators, which weren’t available to some of the pumps that moved sewage from low-lying areas to higher ground. As a result, the sewers backed up after the weather continued to prolonged the outage. While government officials tasked with disaster planning have long focused on the cascading effects of power outages from natural disasters, only recently have they realized the effects of cyber warfare could be quite similar.\n\n\nCascading Effects\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Naval War College held a war game to examine the effects of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The result was that “cross-sector dependencies on electricity, transportation, and wastewater systems made significant attacks on these sectors exponentially more deleterious.”\nA review of disaster planning research can give examples of the way prolonged power outages could drive consequences few would consider.\nImagine a hypothetical DDoS attack shuts down a major urban water system. Many of the controls used to cool various systems rely on water. If water cannot be pumped, these systems might turn to backups, which might be limited. That could lead to both a power outage, and a telecommunications outage. That, in turn, would lead to diminished cell phone and internet traffic.\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Predictions]\nNearly 70 percent of the food Americans eat passes through a vast network of refrigerated warehouses. With no power and no communications, the logistics teams would have no way to keep their products cool and no way to coordinate delivery to other warehouses.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nAttacks on infrastructure aren’t just a mere hypothetical. Just last year, dozens of U.S. utility companies were compromised to such an extent that the hackers could have shut them down. In the Ukraine, hackers disrupted the power grid two years in a row, causing hundreds of thousands to lose power.\nWho Would Do Such a Thing?\nInfrastructure operators can be victims of hackers facing any number of motivations, including money, politics or vandalism. The biggest motive for cyberattacks over the past few years has been financial gain – with profit in mind, companies that most likely have the cash to pay ransoms are typically the target. However, there are strong indications that bigger and more organized actors have probed U.S. nuclear power plants, a dam in New York and a network that sits at the center of the global banking system.\n [You might also like: Pandora’s Box: Auditing for DDoS Vulnerabilities, Part I]\nFear of retaliation is likely the best explanation for why a major attack hasn’t occurred. Attackers might want to shut down a major power grid in a target country, but the possibility that the same attack or worse could be perpetrated against them acts as a deterrent. Even more concerning is the threat that cyber-sniping could lead to conventional warfare.\nA Stronger Defense\nModern society is built around connected infrastructure services. At the end of the day, the complexity and security of our infrastructure, and its interdependence with other systems, requires close attention — more than it has gotten until now.\nThe demands of business have translated to infrastructure networks that are no longer closed loops, as they were a decade ago. Companies can now gain access to data analytics to constantly measure and optimize machinery performance, saving time and money. And while these advances have certainly resulted in clear gains, they have opened up new attack vectors for malicious attackers.\nJust as we’ve seen with countless examples of consumer IoT devices being hacked, when connected technology is introduced to devices and security is left out of the equation, the consequences can be harsh. We must ask ourselves whether we are truly able to protect transportation systems, our financial sector and other critical infrastructure from cyber threats.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'disaster preparedness\', \'Infrastructure\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/02/cyber-security-natural-disasters/');

Just as small enterprises everywhere are searching for ways to shore up their protection and avoid business disruptions, healthcare organizations have an obligation to protect their business and their patients’ sensitive information.  Hospitals and doctors’ offices need help keeping their data secure.\nFortunately, service providers are in a prime position to provide these security services to the healthcare industry. Service providers who already are experienced (either by themselves or with partners) in protecting their network infrastructure and offering services to small and medium business can benefit from new revenue streams by offering security solutions to the healthcare sector.\n\n\nRead “Cyber Economics: Validating DDoS Managed Service Delivery Models” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Healthcare\', \'Medical\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/02/secure-medical-data/');

With over 1.07 million tickets available for 102 events over 16 days, spread out across two clusters and containing a total of 12 venues, the crowds at the 2018 Winter Olympics will bring a large demand for connectivity. This enormous demand for connectivity and technology at the Winter Olympics will also pose a security risk for Olympic organizers, partners, sponsors, suppliers, service providers, athletes and attendees.\n\nThere are only a few sporting events in the world as large as the Olympics. With millions of attendees and global viewers the Olympics generate a lot of excitement and demand from the fans. Beyond just the games itself, the variety of multimedia technologies available for streaming content, drones, augmented reality and wearables provide viewers and attendees with a more immersive and interactive experiences than ever before.\n\nSmart stadiums and venues today now offer network connectivity for fans via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a number of other digital services. But reliable Wi-Fi is normally an issue at large scale events. Users demand to experience the games in new ways and share content in real-time. Imagine the stress 50,000 attendees can put on the network of one venue while everyone simultaneously tries to tweet, post, snap and stream every moment of the games in real time. Now multiply this by 12 venues and you begin to understand the magnitude of the challenges of providing connectivity to the Olympic games in PyeongChang.  This kind of demand for instant and on-demand connectivity will stretch even the best networks and often require massive upgrades ahead of the event.\nBecause of the large demand for connectivity expected from the games, Korea Telecom. in partnership with Intel, will be delivering the first broad-scale 5G network for the games and enable attendees to engage in a variety of experiences at the Winter Olympics. In addition to this, NBC is preparing to live-stream 1,800 hours of the Winter Olympics this month for those who are not able to attend. Four years ago at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, NBC was able to broadcast 1,000 hours of live content.\n [You might also like: The Evolution of the Dark Web]\nPossible Threats\nAlong with the demand for technology and connectivity, the games are also becoming more reliant on critical applications to help provide this experience to those onsite and around the world.  Technology can provide a more immersive and rewarding experience for fans, but also create problems and security risks for those managing the event networks.  Over the last decade there have been a number of cyber-security related events aimed at the Olympics. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, hackers launched persistent and automated attacks every day during the games. During the 2016 games at the Summer Olympics in Rio, attackers launched persistent DDoS attacks that reached peaks over 500Gbps.\nTypically, attackers begin probing and launching attacks against the Olympics several months ahead of the games. This year several organizations associated with the games have already been targeted by spear phishing attacks. A phishing attack is a digital attempt to obtain sensitive information from a victim by using a malicious email or website. The attacker solicits personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization or the company itself. These attempts are either sent out to everyone in the company or designed to specifically target key associates. Once an associate falls victim to these the hacker will then have the sensitive information required to gain access to certain systems.\nThe potential risk steadily increases as future games become even more connected.  The 2018 Winter Olympics have the potential to be one of the more vulnerable sporting events and will provide cyber criminals with numerous opportunities to profit. The Winter Olympics also creates a great platform for hacktivists and cyber criminals to spread a message, make profit or simply create disruption.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nToday, it is very easy for low-level threat actors to carry out large scale and disruptive attacks. Toolkits and attack services are widely available for purchase on the clear and darknet.  At the 2018 Winter Olympics most cyber criminals and hacktivists will be focused on identity theft by spreading malicious payloads in a number of ways that are designed to harvest and steal personal information. Often times it’s the technologies designed to enhance the spectators’ experience like free Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other digital services that are ultimately abused and exploited to harvest information from the attendees, athletes, journalists and broadcasters.\nOne of the biggest concerns about the Olympics this year is protecting the critical applications and networks that support the event. Broadcast networks, industrial control systems, operational networks and other related systems are all at risk. Hackers could try and disrupt the games inside the venues or through the live stream.  Hacktivists and criminals will launch application attacks like SQL injections, password cracking, cookie poisoning, cross-site scripting, session hijacking and more in an attempt to steal Olympic and spectator data. Information on the attendees, sponsors, or athletes can be quickly monetized or publicly used. Criminals will also use fake applications and websites to target attendees.\nThe risk of your mobile device being hacked in an environment like this grows exponentially with more people that connect to the same network. It becomes ever more attractive for criminals due to the larger number of users.  There is also a high risk for targeted attacks against high profile visitors and athletes at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Visitor devices could be easily targeted by cyber criminals at the games. Fake charging stations or compromised access points can quickly allow an attacker to gain access to a device. Once infected, devices can perform tasks like record audio and video, take photos, send text messages, open webpages, steal user data, delete files, launch denial-of-service attacks via HTTP floods, and perform web injections. In the event of targeting an athlete, competitive information such as their routine or their social media account could be hijacked.\n [You might also like: Bad Packets 2017 – A Year in Review]\nProviding spectators and athletes with connectivity is a double-edge sword. Connected venues can become a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) nightmare for event management and wireless network operators. Open Wi-Fi networks also present one of the biggest attack vectors for network and malware-based attacks. Criminals know that visitors at the 2018 Winter Olympics will be reliant on such Wi-Fi access points, turning them into an easy target.\nSource: Radware\nAs part of their preparations, hacktivists and cyber criminals have likely already identified access points and their vulnerabilities across the Olympic venues. They will set up fake access points to intercept and manipulate their victims’ browsing and to steal passwords, credit cards, PII and other sensitive information. A common Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) tactic using malicious access points is to name a fake access point as the same name of a legitimate access point. Once a user is connected, malware can be injected onto their device or its traffic can be inspected. This year at the Winter Olympics I expect to see a number of compromised, insecure and vulnerable access points.\nI also expect to see a number of criminals leveraging social media and email to spread their malicious domains designed to harvest personal information. Users are normally directed to these sites after falling victim to fake giveaways for tickets or promotional material on social media or via email. Criminals behind bad domains look to hijack the names of the cities, venues or event names to trick users via typo squatting into entering their credentials by spoofing the content of the original websites.\nAttendees at the 2018 Winter Olympics should also be aware of other data mining attacks delivered via fake pop-ups or text messages. They should also be aware of physical attacks such as juice jacking, and ATM/ Point-of-Sale (PoS) skimmers. Criminals will be deploying skimmers on ATMs and PoS systems at the 2018 Winter Olympics. It allows hackers to record the ATM user information and later sell it for profit on the Darknet. The larger the crowd,  the higher the number of potential victims, making the Olympic crowds a prime target for profit-motivated criminals.\nAttendees at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang should take these steps to keep their devices and information secure:\n\nEnsure your phone is updated with the latest operating system\nDisable Bluetooth when not in use\nDisable Wi-Fi when not in use\nUse the official event Wi-Fi when device is in use\nAlways use a VPN when using Wi-Fi\nHave RFID shields to protect RFID cards\nBe careful when using ATMs and Point of Sale systems – Understand how to spot and avoid card skimmers gathering data\nExercise caution when presented with pop-ups while browsing\nAvoid Olympic-related scams delivered via email\nAvoid promotional USBs\nAvoid public charging stations\n\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'hacktivists\', \'olympics\', \'Winter Olympics\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/2018-winter-olympics/');

Many have called a Bubble on the Crypto Coins and likened it to Tulip Mania, while others caution about the Dot Com Bubble and how this has the same look and feel of that.  One thing is for certain: There will be some winners in the technology space, and some form of blockchain technology will live on, just like the dot com did. We all still use the internet and dot com companies as an everyday thing. Can we look at the past “dot com bust” and predict the future of blockchain, cryptos and the future of this technology?\n\nI recently attended the MIT Enterprise Forum  on building the blockchain ecosystem.\nThe group of speakers consisted of Lawrence Lerner, (from Rchain), Ryan Strauss (Seattle University School of Law), John Utley (IBM), and Jagan Namani (Madrona Ventures).  As the speakers presented, I had a few key questions that I wanted to learn about:\nPhoto: Collin Sleeper, PYXD Photography\n\nWhat’s happening from a regulatory standpoint?\nHow is funding done and what are fundamental differences in the blockchain industry that are driving this change?\nWhat makes a solid business model for blockchain businesses?\nPicks and Shovels vs. Industry solutions – Which drives adoption faster?\n\nI was excited to hear about what IBM was doing in the space, especially because of my curiosity around Stellar Lumens and the IBM CryptoCoin.  John Utley from IBM spoke about all of the various ways IBM Blockchain technologies are finding ways to deal with supply chain at Boeing as well as many other companies.  On Tuesday, IBM announced it teamed up with the world’s largest container shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, to provide a new platform for conducting global trade using blockchain technology.  We tried to get John to share more about Stellar Lumens and some of the banking partnerships IBM has in the South Asia Pacific region, but unfortunately the event ran out of time to get the answer.  Hopefully people following IBM will learn more on their next earnings calls.\n [You might also like: Blockchain and the future of IoT]\nFrom the question on what’s happening from a regulatory standpoint, I think there are some insights that were given, but we still are so early on in some of the technology that it’s mere speculation.  This week, similar to January 2017 and 2016, the crypto market had another big rollercoaster ride. Fears that the Korean government are starting to regulate crypto currencies as well as China and Russia may have played into the large price drop in crypto currencies.  Some of the discussion that did shed light on this is how some companies are now starting to look at smart contracts using blockchains. There’s still no legal established practices in the U.S. today for this, however, we may see some of these changes for blockchains establishing trust in legal frameworks.\nOne of the more interesting topics that came up during this event was the idea of digital voting using Blockchain. There is a whitepaper from Plymouth University that talks about how voting could be changed and much more secure using a blockchain.\nVoter registration could be tied to unique cryptographic addresses for each voter and upon proof of identification and the voter registration QR code, voting could be done with a web browser or at any polling station.  The possibility of having voting records on a public blockchain and no longer using paper ballots could be a great reduction in error, voter fraud, and attacks on the voting platform itself.\n\nIn the coming years we are going to see more adoption of blockchain technologies:\nHow can the automotive industry use blockchains?\nToday, it’s conceivable that an automaker will be able to track the provenance of a part from inception to disposal. By using a blockchain, a unique ID for each and every part is created and recorded, along with immutable timestamps from the moment of creation. Crypto-enabled tags that speak directly to the blockchain can be embedded directly into the part to add another layer of authenticity protection.

Whether the IT system complexity came from mergers of companies or through an organic growth of IT systems to meet the needs of business, every large multinational organization struggles to maintain and run IT systems that span the width of mainframe, C/S and cloud apps, different operating systems, and different programming languages.\n [You might also like: Blockchain and the future of IoT – Part 2]\nBlockchain offers the opportunity to simplify. Because blockchains enforce a single source of truth, in real-time, the risk of two systems having conflicting information drastically reduces. Systems and people can act with more confidence, and faster, because they are accessing true and trustworthy data in that moment. Because there’s a single source of truth, there’s less of a need for auxiliary systems to reconcile errors and inconsistencies, offering the hope of reducing system complexity. Because system complexity is reduced, businesses can react faster to market demands to release a new product, provide value-added services or optimize operational efficiency in the supply chain. Blockchains bring simplicity and speed to complex and slow systems, while reducing the costs to run IT. CIOs, CTOs and CFOs should be able to make a strong case for cost efficiencies by implementing blockchain technologies.\n Walmart Pork\nGlobal retail giant Walmart hosted a presentation on its work with blockchain during an annual investor event. The company began working with IBM and Tsinghua University of Beijing last year to test blockchain-based supply chain applications, with a particular focus on China’s massive pork market. In follow-up statements, Walmart indicated it wanted to apply the tech to various areas – and more recently, CoinDesk reported the company is looking at blockchain as a tracking solution for unmanned delivery vehicles. Walmart explained that the technology has helped it reduced the time it takes to track food from days to minutes, enabling more effective response in the event that tainted products are discovered.\nThis will help enable precise and rapid recalls to preserve consumer trust in the food industry, while increasing traceability and transparency of the food system\nIn the coming years we are going to see more adoption of blockchain technologies and see the uses expand. While many are seeing crypto currencies as the next gold rush, will the blockchain itself become the next big technology gold rush?  One thing is certain, blockchain is here to stay.  As regulators and technologists work side by side, we will begin to see new ways that both the cryptocurrency world and the blockchain will form the future.\nWhile we watch the adoption of these technologies, there’s a number of things we believe you might want to consider.   Blockchain is not a magic bullet.  Unlike the public blockchains, if you are integrating a blockchain into your business, it is a private blockchain.   The enterprise owns the blockchain and is writing and verifying each transaction, as well as gives permissions to a limited community.   In this model, it’s essentially almost the same as not having a blockchain and running a database.   The second thing to consider is this can become a lot more complicated with compliance like GDPR, where users have the right to be forgotten.   How would you purge all data from a distributed ledger should a user wish to be forgotten?    With this said, blockchain technology has its advantages, but don’t let a hot trending buzzword become your go to solution for security.\nTo watch the full panel discussion, you can see the video here.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Blockchain\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/review-mit-etf-blockchain-presentation/');

But rather than start a bar fight (and, yes, I grew up on the Jersey Shore), I prefer to do this by diving head first into something seriously technical.\n\nSo, my afternoon with Radware a few weeks ago was just what the bartender ordered: Super technical material, interesting applications of complex SDN infrastructure, and detailed explanations of new flow orchestration tools that don’t pause for Luddites.

It’s been bothering me recently that many technology companies and enterprise teams are not more effectively using the power of software defined networking (SDN) to orchestrate security controls. SDN, you will recall, is centered on the notion of dynamically orchestrating networked entities, such as virtual routers, using software.\n [You might also like: Has Cyber Security Reached Its Limits?]\nAn innovative solution uses the northbound interface on the SDN controller to monitor a customer’s network for volumetric increases, and to then dynamically task redirection of flow on the southbound interface to handle the attack. Vendors like Radware, with experience in load balancing, WAF, and anti-DDoS provide the perfect backdrop to building such an elegant approach to the problem.\nVisualize this in your mind: External traffic is being managed inbound through your software defined data center with the usual assortment of internal destinations: websites, apps, endpoints, and so on. A DDoS attack suddenly builds up toward one of your targets, probably the website, and the SDN controller immediately flow-orchestrates the increased volume to a collection of sinks or scrubbers, while maintaining proper traffic flow to non-targeted entities.\nIt’s important to provide detection and orchestration of security at scale, because we know that with the speed of attacks were seeing on the Internet, enterprise teams will need to rely on proper automation to keep their applications and systems up and running.\nOne positive implication of software-defined flow orchestration in the enterprise is that the sinks and scrubbers used for traffic redirection can be pretty much anything you like. Radware builds, for example, a cloud WAF service can be integrated into your operation in much the same as your DDoS solution: The WAF becomes a dynamic target for traffic that requires real-time application protection. It’s a nice idea.\nIf you’ve had it just-about-up-to-here with compliance, or audit, or Boards, or whatever yanks your chain, then try taking a deep dive into some nice, complex API specifications – You’ll feel better immediately.\n\n\nRead “2017-2018 Global Application & Network Security Report” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'load balancing\', \'SDN\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/orchestrating-flows-cyber/');

This requires us to expand our scope and scale of scrubbing capabilities.  However, capacity alone is not enough.  We had to rethink how to approach DDoS protection for modern applications against sophisticated as well as high volume attacks.\n\nFrom a traffic-based view to an application-based view\nRadware’s DDoS scrubbing network has seen its network rapidly expand, from six global scrubbing centers to nine scrubbing centers worldwide, with locations in Seoul, Johannesburg, and Sydney. In addition, we expanded our mitigation capacity to 3.5 Tbps and to 6+ billion packets per second (PPS) of network connections, to make sure we stay ahead of the game in the event of large-scale attacks.\n [You might also like: Has Cyber Security Reached Its Limits?]\nThe biggest change in our new approach was to stop thinking about protecting traffic and start thinking about how we protect applications. Modern web applications (and modern DevOps teams) don’t think about how much traffic they generate; rather, they think about their applications in terms of users, requests, and concurrent connections, as well as how to handle new standards of encrypted SSL / TLS traffic.\nThis represents a significant shift from looking at DDoS protection through an outdated lens of traffic – which only counts how many Tbps it can handle – to an application view, which is not only better suited for how modern web applications are built, but also provides better DDoS protection.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nTbps don’t matter, PPS do\nWell, Tbps do matter. But not as much as you’d think.\nTraditionally, the way to look at DDoS protection was to count gigabits (Gbps) and Terabits (Tbps) of traffic. This has led some DDoS protection vendors to make increasingly outsized claims about protection capacity.\nHowever, there are two problems with this approach:\nOne problem is that this capacity is largely superfluous. Although large DDoS attacks make for scary headlines and page clicks, in practice, the vast majority of DDoS attacks are much smaller. According to Radware’s 2017 ERT Report, 79% of DDoS attacks are smaller than 1 Gbps, and only 4% of attacks are larger than 50 Gbps.\nThe largest DDoS attack recorded to date – the Mirai botnet attack against Dyn – reached a reported peak of 1.2 Tbps. Most leading DDoS protection vendors have far more mitigation capacity than even the largest DDoS attacks ever recorded, and even smaller DDoS vendors can usually absorb such large attacks, let alone smaller ones.\n [You might also like: 5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing]\nThe other problem with a traffic-based approach to DDoS protection is that attack size, by itself, tells you very little about the nature of the attack itself. Large DDoS attacks tend to be simple volumetric floods of network-layer protocols such as TCP and UDP. However, a much smaller application-level attack such as HTTP flood can do more damage than a larger UDP flood.\nTherefore, when evaluating DDoS attacks, a more useful factor is the rate of packets-per-second (PPS). The higher the rate of packets, the more severe the attack. This is particularly true with a new generation of emergent DDoS attacks such as SSL-based DDoS attacks, Low-&-Slow attacks, DNS-based attacks and IoT-based botnet attacks, which can make use of large number of concurrent connections to overwhelm applications.\nRise of SSL\nAs more and more web traffic is encrypted, SSL-based DDoS attacks are becoming increasingly more frequent and more harmful. SSL DDoS attacks are particularly potent because they demand large amounts of computing resources from target servers. A single SSL request can require up to x15 more resources from the target server than from the origin computer. Radware’s scrubbing centers are fully integrated with our DefenseSSL technology, to provide cloud-based SSL DDoS protection, without requiring users to provide full SSL keys, and without adding latency in peacetime.\nThis a crucial benefit to many customers, as it simplifies SSL key management, preserves user confidentiality and regulatory requirements, and does not impede application performance.\n\n\nDownload “One Scrubbing Center to Rule Them All” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'IoT\', \'scrubbing centers\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/rethinking-scrubbing-center/');

This is not what was intended when “Agile” moved from being a pure development approach to a whole technology management methodology, but it is where we find ourselves. One of the consequences we face because of this is that the traditional user of many technologies, the developers/application owners, know what functionality they should have but not where to get it.\n\n\nThis situation is exacerbated by several factors:\n\nEase of procurement and perceived initial set-up is considered of paramount importance (research takes too long).\nTechnology vendors have been slow to accept the fact that their traditional buyers are no longer the sole or key decision makers.\nLarge clouds call “products” by familiar names but do not offer what has been considered standard functionality in these products. A good example close to my heart was the case of session persistence. When AWS first started offering their load balancer, it could distribute traffic that is true, so in the most basic sense of the word it was a load balancer. However, it was missing so many things that were previously considered basic functional requirements of a load balancer/ADC. For example, every load balancer on the market for at least a decade prior included session persistence as part of core functionality. I know AWS has added this now but it took them over two years. The reaction from the developers when they realized they didn’t have session persistence out of the box illustrates what has happened on a much grander scale with the growth of cloud. They built it themselves (if you can’t buy it, you build it). The problem is the first decision to use AWS LB was made for agility reasons. It’s quick and easy to buy, frictionless procurement from the market place with a CC…. but in the end it doesn’t save time because the developers have to do more coding to get session persistence built into the app.\nThe failure by most of the analyst firms to call out the differences or specific deficiencies between technologies. A good example is WAF. The accepted definition of WAF used to include the requirement of positive enforcement. Today, as far as I know, only one cloud WAF company/offering does positive enforcement. Even Imperva, whose own WAF definition on their homepage describes a WAF as having positive and negative enforcement capabilities, does not offer positive enforcement in the cloud, thus making their cloud WAF no more effective than an IPS. At first glance it doesn’t seem like an example of disaggregating tools, but it is because the few times I’ve seen someone rave about their WAF it was not for security but because the WAF was able to virtually patch bad code that wasn’t QA’d effectively. This saved the developers hours and the application its uptime. Most developers unfortunately don’t know that a WAF can do virtual patching. I think it is incumbent on the analyses to lead the market and educate the uninformed about technology and what the different types of technology are meant to do. Today they are too often looking at market spend and deciding on product suitability/definition solely on that factor, which is exacerbating this problem. People still need the functionality, so now they have more products to accomplish the same amount of capability, but with more spend and more complexity.\n\n[You might also like: Marrying the Business Need With Technology Drive, Part Two: Security by Proxy or to Complicate]\nHaving said all of that, I think we may have reached an inflection point. Several times in the past few months I have seen organizations who are cloud-native or cloud-heavy starting projects to rationalize tools and create standards. This is a great opportunity for the traditional manufacturers who have invested time and effort into building suites of solutions into a seamless product/product set. The key here is that the traditional manufacturers and the analysts need to educate the new buyers (developers) about the differences in the value and how we can answer their core business issues in ways that save time and money.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nSeveral examples:\n1) Next gen firewalls – Yes, there are free solutions out there (like AWS security groups often described as firewalls), but 10 years ago they may even have done the job. Today we need solutions that can be more discriminatory. WE need to inspect the actual traffic and make decisions on a per-user access level, not on a per-traffic type level. If we use the free ware we will need several free and some paid solutions (security groups, UR filtering with application control, IPS, possibly anti-malware and anti-virus)to achieve the same functionality and the integration cost that will far outweigh the “free” benefit.\n2) ADC– AWS elastic load balancer is billed as an ADC but it is missing many standard ADC functions, specifically around application and resource monitoring and optimization. In most cases multiple tools end up being bought in order to fill the gaps, or a lot of time is invested to build this missing functionality. Some examples: HTTP2 translation, application performance SLA monitoring/management (not just by using logs), and custom per app, per user application optimization.\n3) WAF– Cloud Native WAFs offer only a small subset of the functionality that a traditional WAF offers, as they do not offer a positive application security model (discussed above).\nSolving this problem is not simple for several reasons:\n\nThe confusion caused by the clouds’ naming conventions and\nThe independent analysts’ lack of leadership on the issue\nThe lack of co-operation that seems to exist within organizations’ traditional operations and DevOps teams.\n\nAs organizations and individuals I can tell you we can simplify our lives. Volume purchasing agreements can eliminate the frictionless procurement objections, help corporations to keep standards, and save time and effort because enterprise solutions bring suites of integrated functions together in one product, thus eliminating lots of time and effort involved with integration. Lastly this all in one cost solution avoids the “death by a thousand cuts” budget problem with disaggregating solutions.

It takes a lot of computing resources to decrypt and re-encrypt the traffic.  Many solutions use hardware-based encryption acceleration because of this fact.\n [You might also like: Old Technologies Enable Future Secure Application Delivery Networking]\nIf the ADC and WAF are separate devices, the application traffic must be decrypted, inspected, and re-encrypted each time introducing latency and complexity into the network infrastructure.  This doubles the encryption engine requirements, costs money to implement, and makes the operational management of the application delivery infrastructure harder to maintain.\nWhen the ADC and WAF are combined into a unified solution, the application traffic only needs to be decrypted once for load balancing decisions and security validation.  The simplicity of decrypting the content once to perform all of the content inspection functions in one process makes everything run faster and smoother.\nMulti-function, not multi-task\nThe ADC is a IT tool that performs many functions.

Let’s take a closer look at 2017 trends and 2018 predictions:\n\nIs cyber-security pushed to the limit?\nThe human mind is exceptional in many situations, but has its limits. It seems that the pace of innovation today is much faster than its ability to quickly collect and analyze data patterns and optimize decision making. For instance, 51% of applications undergo changes every week (16% growth from 2016). When the average organization uses dozens of applications, it is also impossible to track and test all these changes, especially when there are time-to-market pressures.\n\nRise of cryptocurrency trade and value boosts attacks\nThe top driver of cyber-attacks is now cyber-crime. Attackers are motivated by financial gain and driven by the prosperity of cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, attacks are becoming more targeted. A determined enemy will take the time to learn the target by investing in reconnaissance, social engineering and specific tools.\nReports of ransomware attacks – in which hackers use malware to encrypt data, systems, and networks until a ransom is paid – surged in the past year, increasing 40% from 2016. Ransom payments of $300 in May, 2017 (WannaCry) made in bitcoin are now worth eight times that amount. Such ROI draws more participants into the game, driving the exponential growth of the value of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero and others. Companies don’t expect this threat to go away in 2018 either. One in four executives (26%) noted that ransom would be the largest threat to their business in the coming year, tied with data theft as the most common concern.\n\n\nRansom is the motivation behind 50% of the attacks\nIncidence has grown by 40% Year-over-Year\nRansom is the top concern of security professionals in 2018\nOne in eight organizations suffered a DDoS Extortion\n\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nIoT threat emerges but no one claims responsibility\nIn late 2016 we all witnessed how the threat of a tremendous amount of connected devices took form in a botnet (named Mirai) of 150K such devices that eventually took down DynDNS servers, causing a major internet services outage in the US. The lessons were quite obvious: 1. These devices are insecurely built and 2. There are billions of them out there. However, neither the manufacturers nor the regulators took action to set a standard that yields in a safer IoT integrated environment. In the interim, more and more IoT botnets are joining the game, most are variations and mutations of previous versions.\nThe insecure digital experience:\nAccording to Radware’s Global Application and Network Security Report, one in six organizations has suffered a DDoS attack by an IoT botnet. In addition, IoTs are a major contributor to the fact that for the first time the majority of DDoS attacks are utilizing application layer communication rather than network layer. DDoS attacks, however, are not the sole threat – many organizations face a challenge when willing to integrate IoT devices into their own network. The primary concern they report is that it complicates the security management. The information security is only as strong as its weakest link –in this case the IoTs are the usual suspect.\n\nNotorious attacks of the year point at the human factor to blame\nCan’t always blame technology though. The major attacks of the year taught us that in many cases, the weakest link is actually the human factor – whether the reason is not patching vulnerabilities on time, or simply leaving a back door open and data exposed. Indeed, three in five information security professionals do not express a high level of confidence in their fellow employees.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nHowever, if you expected that such compelling events would urge organizations to go ahead and make foundational alterations in either their security or way of thinking, you will be surprised to learn that the majority took little to no action.\nMeasures taken by businesses following a global cyber-attack campaign\nWhile in such examples humans fail to protect one organization from a specific attack, let’s not forget that an attack tool – allegedly leaked from a governmental agency – powered the three major ransom sprees of the year.\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Predictions]\nWhen asked about future concerns, the human factor also steps onto the podium:\n\nMisconfigurations – #1 risk in cloud environments\nBetter security – #1 reason to adopt machine-learning based solutions\nThe user (commercial or private) is responsible for securely operating IoT devices\n1 in 3 still have no plan for emergency situations\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nHow severe can these human errors be?\n\nApparently, nearly 80% do not calculate the cost of a cyber-attack. Those who do, provide a higher than double estimate compared to the others ($1.3M vs. $560K). Such costs include revenue loss, production loss, fees and PR and remediation expenses.\nDespite a notion of tolerance, in one of four cases customers will take action against a targeted organization\nJust like we understand this challenge and can be forgiving, so are business customers in the majority of the cases. Generally, only in one of four cases will customers take action against an organization that has suffered a cyber-attack. However, with attacks now being a fact of life, the absolute number of potential reasons for liability issues is increasing.\n\nMachine-learning technologies are not fully mature nor broadly adopted\n Despite the sincere acknowledgement of security professionals in the challenge to fully protect the sensitive information in their organization’s network (68% do not confide in their security posture)* , only one in five has begun relying on machine-learning / AI based solutions for protection. While for another 28% this is on the radar, there is certainly a gap at this point in time between the required level of controlling the security of information and the ability to execute.\nHumans simply are not able to identify attacks by sifting through the massive quantity of data generated by network logs and other sources. The sheer number of indicators of compromise (IOCs) that security products generate overwhelm security teams. Many IOCs are false alarms that waste limited security resources.\nWhere human intelligence and bandwidth fall short, machines can help. Machine-learning algorithms perform exceptionally well in analyzing log data to identify and classify anomalous behavior or subtle differences indicating attempted compromise.\n [You might also like: 2017’s 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 1)]\nThe DDoS Threat Landscape\nRansomware is not the only extortion method. Cyber delinquents today threaten organizations with denial-of-service attacks against their networks and servers unless paid a certain amount of Bitcoin. They usually follow up with a ‘demo’ attack to prove they are serious and capable. This – as well as the growing prevalence of IoT botnets – are just a couple of the emerging DDoS tactics used against businesses in the last year or two. These tactics turn more mature as more attacks end up in a complete outage rather than merely service degradation.\n\nBursts – By launching high amounts of traffic in an instant, hackers typically manage to knock firewalls down instantly before a DDoS mitigation workflow kicks in. these bursts come in random volumes, vectors and intervals. This unexpected availability outage causes businesses significant harm.\nEncrypted Attacks: Encrypted SSL floods, SSL renegotiation, HTTPS floods and utilizing encrypted traffic against application vulnerabilities are becoming a more and more favored way of organizations to bypass security controls and take down network or application resources. 28% of businesses reported suffering encrypted DDoS attacks in 2017.\nDNS – Brute force, query floods, recursive floods and cache poisoning are just a handful of techniques hackers use to prevent DNS servers from operating properly and thus creating an effect that goes to whoever relies on these servers – one organization or many more (as happened to DynDNS).\nReflection and Amplification Attacks:These aren’t new but 2017 also brought an increase in reflection amplification DDoS attacks as a major vector against a wide spectrum of services. Two in five businesses indicated that they experienced a reflected amplification attack in 2017. One-third of those reported that they were unable to mitigate these attacks.\nApplication layer DDoS overtakes network layer DDoS\n\nThis year brought declines in UDP, ICMP, TCP-Other and IPv6 attack vectors—marking a significant drop in network attacks (51% in 2017 vs. 64% in 2016). The incidence of application attacks remained steady at 64% in 2017 compared to 63% the year before.\nData Leakage is the number one concern of organizations today\n\nMore than one-quarter of respondents (28%) cited data leakage/information loss, making it the top concern in the latest survey and continuing the trend from 2016. One in three U.S. and E.U. companies point to data theft as their biggest fear. Data leakage ranks consistently high across all industries. It was especially high in government, suggesting that such organizations are increasingly anxious about their public image. Telecommunications and service providers and high tech companies also cited data leakage as a top fear, reflecting their focus on safeguarding their customer bases.\nTop concerns by vertical\nWhat to do:\nLearn, understand, adopt. Follow the trends and analyze the risks – don’t stay behind. We security companies love to brag about the gaps but remember that the available solutions are quite advanced, and when seamlessly integrated into the business processes and the human behavior, they can provide a decent level of protection that will eventually lead hackers to focus on another target.

The sheer volume of transactional data moving through networks can be staggering and protecting that data from cyberthreats is strategically and fiscally critical. To understand how financial service executives keep their most prized applications secure, Radware surveyed over 600 chief information security officers (CISOs) and other security leaders across financial services, retail and healthcare industries. This article provides an overview of key findings from Radware’s web application security report: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World.\n\nThis emphasis on security and control within the financial services industry is supported by the fact that most surveyed financial service companies have more security controls in place around their applications than counterparts in the retail or healthcare industry (see Figure 1).\n\nEven with more security controls and investment in place than other industry sectors, recent global geopolitical, economic and technological disruptions continue to have transformative impact on how financial services address and mitigate risk.\n\nThe emergence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain is revolutionizing transactions and interactions throughout the global financial community and resulting in new financial technology players that challenge the entire financial landscape as we know it.\nThe digitization of the financial services market empowers consumers and institutional clients, altering the way financial services companies communicate and conduct business. Third-party mobile payment vendors such as Venmo, ApplePay and PayPal adds levels of sophistication and multiple touchpoints that increases the potential for significant threats and attacks.\n\nAs financial services institutions address these critical business and technological challenges, they also must fortify their institutions from the onslaught of potential threats. Over the past 12 months, 35% of respondents have experienced Brute Force attacks, 27% Web scraping attacks and 45% data security breaches. They must also address the growing threat of Layer 7 DDoS attacks as 64% find them most difficult to prevent, detect and contain while more than 65% lack confidence they could mitigate such an attack on the application layer. So where does that leave the financial services sector? Security executives and influencers (from five continents) who responded to the survey collectively lack the confidence they can detect, mitigate and contain security threats. Here are key reasons this crisis of security confidence exists for our financial services survey respondents.\n [You might also like: Retail & Web Application Security: What Application-Layer Security Threats Are in Store for Retailers]\nCONFIDENCE AND MITIGATING RISK\nFrom a detailed analysis of survey results, financial services institutions are concerned they have the necessary security framework in place to successfully mitigate or protect their applications from a variety of potential application-layer threats. Only 40% feel strongly that they can safeguard customers’ financial data and payment records while nearly half do not analyze API vulnerabilities prior to integration.\nTHE AUTOMATED SECURITY AND CODE TESTING GAP\nStatistical evidence from the survey demonstrates that the accelerated rate of application delivery and changes, coupled with emerging technologies, causes security gaps and instabilities, negatively impacting the way internal organizations as well as third parties share data. Only 33% of financial services security executives and their teams are aware of frequent changes made by in-house applications and APIs within the software development environment, while only 41% are able to track data with third parties after the data leaves the corporate network.\nThe security vulnerabilities and threats that increase from these process fractures could be addressed by automated security solutions and code testing. However, only 19% are using API gateways, 25% WAFs and only 36% are using both while only 25% of respondents made significant investment in security controls following an industry-wide security breach.\nEven though nearly 75% share username and passwords and 50% payment details via APIs with third parties, only 53% use encryption when exposing data to third-party APIs and less than half of respondents require authentication from thirty-party APIs or who use a single sign-on (SSO) solution. Without tighter security controls and protocols, financial services institutions, which have large multinational ecosystems of partners, are open to hacks, threats and attacks that can have millions of dollars in financial, productivity and brand loss.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nBEST PRACTICES IN APPLICATION SECURITY\nTo take the critical steps toward a more secure future, first start with a security gap assessment, identifying and analyzing where risks exist in processes, systems and security tools. This should include WAF requirements and maintenance, frequency of policy and signature updates across all security devices and the ability to distinguish between good and bad bots.\nDetermine how to augment existing tools, skills and capabilities with industry-leading security solutions that have demonstrable results in mitigating attacks from emerging technologies. Ensure that security and application development teams have a real-time communications methodology to minimize threats to mobile, Web and thirdparty applications. Finally, develop a realistic budget that ties security investment to quantifiable ROI but also accounts for emerging threats and new technologies.\nDuring this process, keep in mind that WAF technology is central to application security. Businesses require a next-generation WAF that is flexible enough to adapt to changing IT infrastructures and the evolving threat landscape and change based on the needs of the business. Here are seven characteristics to look for when considering a WAF offering.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\n\nAgility Equals Security Risks – DevOps and agile development practices are great at creating new applications quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, the fluidity of these environments also creates a bevy of unintended security risks. Ensure any WAF solution can automatically detect and protect applications as they are added to the network by automatically creating new policies and procedures. Though nearly 60% of network traffic is generated by bots, only 25% of all financial services responders felt with certainty they could distinguish between good and bad bots.\nCover That Top Ten List – Industry pundits and experts at security consortiums and communities continue to categorize and identify the greatest Web application security risks facing organizations. A WAF solution should provide complete coverage, including all OWASP Top 10 risks.\nDevice Fingerprinting – Bots, crawlers and spammers, using new techniques to disguise malicious traffic, can exhaust resources and scrape sensitive information from websites or cloud-based assets. A good WAF needs to sniff out these clandestine cyber assaulters. Device fingerprinting identifies, blacklists and blocks machines used for attacks regardless of the IP they hide behind. Even if the bot dynamically changes its source IP address, its device fingerprint does not change.\nNegative + Positive = Zero-Day Protection – Advanced application and “smoke screen” attacks that use DDoS assaults to mask other tactics are becoming commonplace, while zero-day assaults swiftly exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities. Negative and positive security models that automatically detect application domains, analyze potential vulnerabilities, and assign optimal protection policies are critical.\nWho’s Knocking at the Door? – Enforcing Web access control policies and security procedures is a bread and butter function of any WAF. How to do it is where the devil is in the detail. Ensure any WAF offering supports user authentication and single sign-on (SSO) functions. This applies two-factor authentication and enables access to premise-based applications from outside the enterprise network. In addition, it ensures access to data based on a user’s role/business needs.\nTwo Minds Are Better Than One – Cyber-attacks are increasing in severity and complexity, making it difficult for organizations to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving threat landscape. To assist, a WAF vendor should provide options for fully managed services for both on-premises and cloud-based WAF deployments. This provides the organization with the insight and expertise from security experts that can assume full responsibility to configure and update security policies as well as actively monitor, detect, alert and mitigate attacks in real time.\nProtection Via Unification – Leading analysts agree that the best WAF solution is one that provides both on-premises and cloud-based offerings. It provides a unified solution that ensures complete availability and protection with no security gaps between on-premises and Web applications, and facilitates quick and easy migration of applications to the cloud.\n\nIn conclusion, ensure that any WAF solution your organization is evaluating covers these critical security solution fundamentals – complete OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, effective API security, HTTP DDoS mitigation. By evaluating existing security processes, systems and security tools, and implementing application security solutions and practices that augment and enhance these capabilities, organizations will build the foundation for an application-secure infrastructure.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Finance\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/application-layer-security-threats-finance/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (60, 'Retail & Web Application Security: What Application-Layer Security Threats Are in Store for Retailer', 'Radware', '2018-1-10', 'The retail industry is undergoing a transformative period as the “empowered” consumer, driven by technological advances and breakthroughs, impacts how retailers market, communicate and sell. Retailers continue to erode the barrier to purchase via a myriad of new technologies, such as mobile apps, social media transactions and AI that converse with consumers. They leverage AI to analyze buyer behavior and optimize buyer preferences. Even “traditional” retailers have invested in technologies that track both offline and in-store behaviors to further reduce the barrier to sale regardless of location.\n\nTo achieve such pervasive consumer contact, retail technologies depend upon bot automation. Bots have radically altered how consumers connect with retailers and consumer product companies. In retail, bots are everywhere, from electronic couponing to price aggregators, and from programmatic ad buying to app-to-app communications (chatbots).\nTo understand what C-level security executives think about overcoming both these technological challenges while managing processes and people, Radware surveyed over 600 chief information security officers (CISOs) and other security leaders across six continents. This article provides an overview of key findings from Radware’s web application security report: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World.\nWith the rise of bots comes the security risks of discerning bad versus good bots. Our survey shows that 70% of generated network traffic is bots, but less than 20% of respondents can discern with certainty between good and bad bots (see Figure 1). Bad bots can wreak significant financial havoc on a retailer, stealing intellectual property via Web scraping, undercutting or stealing pricing and disrupting inventory management. For example, “sneakerbots1” have transcended the sneaker market and are now buying out all manner of highly anticipated products before they are available online.\n\nBecause consumers expect the highest level of security from their sites and places they shop, ensuring that the retailer will protect their personal and financial data, retailers must adopt to the accelerated rate of technology change and growing security risks to realize high levels of customer loyalty, brand reputation and customer satisfaction. Let us review some of the security issues facing retailers today and see why these respondents currently lack confidence that they can offer the level of security their customers demand and expect.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\nBOTS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES\nAs mentioned previously, bots are a key technology issue of which respondents take serious notice. For those respondents who could distinguish between good and bad bots, bad bots often attack retailers in the form of Web scraping attacks. In fact, 75% of retailers said that Web scraping is a very significant risk to their intellectual property. Radware research indicates that 72% of retailers reported experiencing negative consequences to Web scraping attacks, including gathering of pricing information (56%), held inventory (45%), website copying (39%), and inventory depletion (32%) (see Figure 2).\n\nIn addition, the increasing risk of encrypted Web attacks, such as Layer 7 DDoS as well as other attack vectors such as Brute Force and data security breaches, are of major concerns to retailers, who may not have the solutions to mitigate the risk. While retail applications and Web servers have experienced Brute Force (36%) and Layer 7 DDoS (25%) attacks over the past 12 months, only 16% of respondents are confident they could quickly detect one of these attacks and only 21% feel very confident they could quickly mitigate it.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nCONFIDENCE AND MITIGATING RISK\nInsights from the survey regarding retail confidence in mitigating risk demonstrate that retailers are not completely comfortable they have the tools, solutions and proper investments to address the issues. Just 32% have confidence they could secure sensitive data (e.g., credit card) while over 60% cannot track data shared with third parties once the data leaves the corporate network (see Figure 3).\n [You might also like: Healthcare & Web Application Security: A Prescriptive Look at Application-Layer Security Risks]\nThere is also growing concern that this lack of confidence may be founded in the fact that only one in five respondents are fully aware of changes made to in-house applications and APIs within their software development environment. Even though 33% are required to comply with PCI standards, nearly 60% don’t inspect the data that is being transferred/returned via APIs and less than 40% analyze API vulnerabilities prior to integration.\nAs compared to other industries such as healthcare and financial services, surveyed retailers did not respond to industry-wide security breaches with significant investment in security controls, with only 33% significantly increasing their investments. This is alarming since over 60% of respondents collect customer data for profiling and personalized marketing; this lack of investment may make retailers more vulnerable to threats and attacks.\nThe following statistical analysis from retail respondents demonstrates why many of these enterprises may fall victim to potential application-layer attacks, lacking a comprehensive security framework to identify or mitigate against those attacks. Only 25% of retailers state that they fully integrate security into the delivery of Web applications while only one in three could quickly detect a wide range of threats and attacks. This may be why various retailers around the world have experienced frequent attacks on their applications, making them all too vulnerable to a broad range of threats as well as placing them at a competitive disadvantage (where shoppers will quickly abandon their cart or basket, negatively impacting sales and customer loyalty initiatives).\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ecommerce\', \'Retail\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2018/01/retail-web-application-security/');

Our team took a deep dive into researching and testing many of these threats to find out how they operate and how big of a threat they really were, through setting up honeypots, intentionally bricking a colleague’s device, and setting up IoT chatbots. Below are some of the highlights from our year:\n\n\nOpen-Source Attack Tools Open Pandora’s Box\nOnce dangerous tools are released to the public, they can be downloaded—and modified and enhanced—by anyone. Radware performed a quick test to see how easy or difficult it would be for an average hacker to take the now open-sourced Mirai source code and extend its capabilities with a new, advanced attack vector.\nBrickerBot – The Dark Knight of IoT\nOn April 5th, Radware’s Pascal Geenens released the results of his research from over a four-day period, where our honeypot recorded 1,895 Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) attack attempts performed from several locations around the world. He coined the term “Brickerbot” for this new threat. About a week after the initial discovery of Brickerbot, Pascal offered his thoughts on who was being targeted and why. He also recorded the results of a “brick test” done on a camera belonging to one of our security evangelists.\nBrickerBot.3: The Janit0r is back, with a vengeance\nA new version of the BrickerBot PDoS attack was discovered (BrickerBot.3) with a new command sequence on a different honeypot location. Around this time, the author of Brickerbot also came forward to identify himself and make some statements about the purpose and creation of Brickerbot.\n [You might also like: 2017 in Review: Your Favorite Posts]\nBrickerbot only attacks compromised devices\nRadware decided to conduct further research into how Brickerbot works. Using one of the more recently discovered BrickerBot source IP addresses at the time, we performed a TCP connection test on port TCP/23.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nHajime – Sophisticated, Flexible, Thoughtfully Designed and Future-Proof\nLost amid all the headlines about Brickerbot was another IoT threat, known as Hajime. Unlike Brickerbot, the intentions and author of this botnet were unknown and it was the subject of much research by those who wanted to know what kind of threat they were dealing with. In a timespan of a little over five weeks, we counted almost 15,000 infection attempts from more than 12,000 unique IPs.\nWhy the World is Under the Spell of IoT_Reaper\nIn late October, months after Brickerbot had begun to fade from the spotlight, a new IoT threat formed, known as Reaper. Many thought this botnet could rival Mirai and were calling it potentially one of the most dangerous threats seen. Pascal took a look at how this threat compared to Mirai and the kinds of vulnerabilities that were being exploited.\n [You might also like: Bad Packets 2017 – A Year in Review]\nSMB Vulnerabilities – WannaCry, Adylkuzz and SambaCry\nOn Friday, May 12th a global incident related to a ransomware variant named WannaCry broke out, targeting computers around the world. The campaign spread across networks leveraging a recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft SMB service. A month later the Shadow Brokers, a hacking group that targets the NSA, leaked hacking tools from the Equation Group.\nChatting With IoT Bots\nAfter the Dyn attack by Mirai in October 2016, we knew we were facing a threat that would reshape the DDoS threat landscape. Early January was the time we started to deploy some sensors to get a feel of how bad it actually was. While tracking initial connections, we found that there was less than 10 minutes between any two connections from bots trying to compromise our node. Given this regular activity, we set out to create a chatbot which would have a meaningful dialog with the bots, with the goal to trigger them to reveal their malware binary.\nCodeFork hackers fooled many security solutions. How about yours?\nLast but not least is a campaign by hacktivist group CodeFork. As a result of Radware’s acquisition of Seculert, Radware has expanded its research capabilities to include malware intelligence. For two years, the team had been following CodeFork, who launched a new campaign with updated malware tools and infection techniques.

The campaign spread across networks all over the world, leveraging a recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft SMB service. In this case, Microsoft’s security update was released a month before the Shadow Brokers leaked the FuzzBunch framework that included the exploits and payload used in the campaign. In this blog, ERT Researcher Daniel Smith takes a deep dive into how these variants work.\n\nThe Cost of a DDoS Attack on the Darknet\n\nGuest author David Monahan looks at three factors that influence the cost of a DDoS attack – the evolution and commercialization of the Dark Web, the explosion of IoT devices, and the spread of cryptocurrency.\n\n“For Educational Purposes Only”\n\nOver the last few years, tools such as stressers, ransomware, and Remote Administration Tools (RAT) are being published along with other open source services under the pretenses of education and testing for vulnerabilities and risks.

In 2016, the financial services industry suffered 44 million cyber-attacks, more than any other industry. A report by Beazley Breach Response (BBR) Services found that banks and credit unions with less than $35 million in annual revenue accounted for 81% of hacking and malware breaches at financial institutions. In this blog, we explore how Service Providers have an opportunity here to help protect their customers who may not even know that they are a target.\n\nWhy the World is Under the Spell of IoT_Reaper\n\nFirst, there was Brickerbot. Then, there was Reaper. There were rumors that it could potentially be the most threatening botnet ever seen. In this blog, we delve into the history of Mirai to see how it compares to this new threat, and whether or not we should be concerned about it.\n\nCDN Security is NOT Enough for Today\n\nNew vulnerabilities in CDN networks have left many wondering if the CDNs themselves are vulnerable to a wide variety of cyber-attacks. In this blog, we identify five different threats to CDNs and how you can protect against them.\nConclusion\nAccording to this latest blog from Carl Herberger, 2016 was the year of DDoS, and 2017 was the year of ransom. 2018 is predicted to be the year of automation, or more specifically attacks on automated processes. What else will 2018 bring?\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Botnets\', \'Darknet\', \'ddos\', \'IoT\', \'privacy\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/2017-review-favorite-posts/');

NO.', 'Ben Zilberman', '2017-12-21', 'Radware’s Web Application Security Report finds security flaws in the healthcare industry\nWhat do healthcare institutions, insurance companies, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and manufacturers of medical equipment all have in common?\nIf you guessed room for improvement when it comes to protecting applications, you’re correct.\n\nThe data records these organizations keep are highly sensitive as they affect people’s lives and wellbeing. There are a variety of risks – it only takes one unauthorized access to modify a prescription or change the settings of a medical device. There is a growing trade of medical records over the dark web where their value exceeds the cost of a stolen credit card.\n\nHow can a hospital make sure its network does not go down when a DDoS attack emerges? How can a pharmaceutical company make sure its intellectual property remains uncompromised?\nWhen applications interact and exchange data over APIs, how can the healthcare provider know these APIs are secure and cannot be manipulated to disrupt the service?\nRadware’s latest research delves into the challenges and struggles of organizations in securing applications and services they use. It also give a deep view into the healthcare vertical in particular. \n [You might also like: Healthcare & Web Application Security: A Prescriptive Look at Application-Layer Security Risks]\nMajor Concerns\n46% of healthcare organizations report having experienced a data security breach. \n\nThe most common  vector they point at is brute force, as in many cases it doesn’t take more than that to initiate unauthorized access to data of individuals, not to mention can be an entry point to create a trusted connection with the organization’s network. Yet, many of them do see brute force (as well as web scraping) as relatively easier to mitigate, and their biggest concerns are in fact application-layer DDoS and encrypted attacks:\n\nThe broad scope of concerns is evidence to a notion of losing control among healthcare security officers, of which only 27% testify their ability to secure patient records is low to medium only. While 62% say their biggest fear is DDoS, only 30% of them argue they can protect well against it.\nData Protection and Compliance\nIt is quite an unfortunate picture as the industry deals with quality of life issues. Access to real-time data – like patient records, images and videos – requires both the security and availability of in-house, web, mobile, or cloud applications. Every day there is more data that is created and must be securely stored by these organizations. Their low level of confidence is a warning to all of us who overlook the importance of information security, especially when it gets to our own physical and mental conditions. For this reason, the healthcare sector must comply with a broad, highly specific set of governmental- and industry-led regulations and standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, local regulations like the FDA guidelines in the U.S.) that control the collection, use, sharing and transmittal of sensitive personal and clinical information. However, this is another area where they express low confidence in GDPR readiness; only 29% believe their organization will be in compliance before the regulations take effect.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nProtecting or Jeopardizing Investments?\nHealthcare providers have made large CAPEX investments in sophisticated medical equipment. Due to their long lifecycle, many of these devices are connected to older systems, and downtime for upgrades and patching can cause serious delays to the delivery of medical services. The NHS in U.K. took a hard hit by the WannaCry ransomware campaign in May 2017 for this very reason.\nAnalysis of survey feedback paints a portrait of a sector ill at ease with the growing security demands being placed on their institutions. Nearly two-thirds of respondents have little to no confidence they could rapidly adopt security patches and updates without having an operational impact, while 70% said less than 50% of data loss incidents over the past 24 months were fully tracked and patched.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\nIs Automation the Answer?\nThe healthcare segment struggles to keep up with needed security strategies, technologies and resources that address the level of sophistication fueled by digitization. Trying to be ahead of the game, it makes sense that the healthcare sector would invest in skills, tools and solutions that protect their applications and environments. For better agility and efficiency, more and more healthcare organizations adopt the continuous delivery approach. Here too unfortunately, 70% do not fully integrate security into the process – and that is for in-house applications. The situation is worse in the cloud or mobile:\n\nThey also invest in integration but more integration has a cost – it requires more flexibility and in many cases at the expense of security. When ~50% of your applications undergo changes every month, it is hard to keep track, not to mention keep them secure.\n\nAPIs – The Reason APIs are not the Answer, Yet.\n• Only 25% of respondents are fully aware of changes made to in-house applications and APIs within their software development environment.\n• Less than 40% analyze API vulnerabilities prior to integration.\n• 61% cannot track data shared with third-parties once it leaves the corporate network.\n• 57% do not inspect data that is being transferred/returned via APIs.\nIs Automation the Answer for the Threat Actor?\nBeyond data protection and application vulnerabilities, many respondents see the growing threat from emerging technologies. Bots are becoming more dominant with 36% of network traffic in healthcare being bots. However, only 20% of respondents can identify with certainty whether the 36% are good or bad bots. Because there is more encrypted traffic in healthcare, there is a significant concern regarding encrypted (SSL/TLS) threats and attacks on the application layer. Of all attacks, 41% of respondents indicate that application layer DDoS attacks have occurred more frequently over the past 12 months. Other bot attacks against the applications can be brute force and web scraping, as we saw earlier. \nHealthcare Security is Ill\nRadware research painted a sad picture where healthcare organizations are not in shape to be able to win the battle against more sophisticated, targeted attacks. In this case, this isn’t just a matter of revenue loss or reputation loss, it can potentially result in loss of lives.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Healthcare\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/medical-records-safety/');

Different sources claim that the volume of data on the Surface Web is only 4%-10% (depending on the source) of the overall internet data.\nThe Deep Web contains data which is not for public consumption â hence it can be considered a âgray zoneâ. As such, it may contain reports (scientific, government, subscription-only, etc.), records (medical, financial, etc.), databases (academic, business, etc.), Torrent sites/directories and more.Â  These can be accessed by closed forums, via invitation only or by deeply digging into specific directories/Wikis.\nThe Dark Web (or Darknet â in contrast to Clearnet) contains various types of illegal data and services that can be accessed only via specific tools (primarily ToR – The Onion Router) as it employs non-standard protocols, ports and cryptography, where the objective is to keep a userâs total anonymity. As we often hear on the media, the Darknet is a fertile ground for illegal trades and content (narcotics, firearms, stolen IDs, child pornography, etc.), although known marketplaces frequently go up and down or are permanently closed (Alphabay, TheRealDeal, Valhalla and others).\n [You might also like: The Growth of DDoS-as-a-Service: Stresser Services]\nDDoS Attack Campaigns Evolution\nIf we take a look at the cyber-attack landscape, we witness much more organized and focused Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack campaigns that are on a completely different level.Â  The two key factors to observe are:\nFactor #1: Attack footprint is hard to predict â The development of recent DDoS attacks over time does not have a clear, predictable footprint.Â Attacks are longer, while the intensity and changes in volume become more dynamic and do not always present repeating patterns.Â  Attacks are coming from different (often spoofed) sources, originating from different C&Cs, and using multiple vectors – to the effect that they start, disappear, and return in greater intensity. See the attack histogram in Figure 1 below as a nice example:\nSource: Radware ERT / Cloud Security Services\nFactor #2: Attacks are more targeted â While many attack tools and exploit packs are available out there, the attack campaigns themselves are targeting specific vertical markets, specific customers, and even specific personas (e.g. corporate executives).Â  For example, take a look at Dragonfly, a cyber-attack group that targeted the energy sector in Europe and North America. The goal of their latest attack campaign, Dragonfly 2.0, was collecting intelligence and gaining access to the networks of the targeted organizations, eventually making the group capable of mounting sabotage operations when required. The attack featured malicious email campaigns during 2016-2017, leveraging an infected document to leak the victimâs credentials to a server outside of the organization, and finally these credentials were used as follow-up attacks on the targeted energy organizations.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nAttack Campaigns and the Darknet\nSo the question is, does the Darknet play a role in helping the perpetrators?Â  Absolutely.Â  If youâre the CISO of a large enterprise, there are specific items that may matter highly to you. For instance, in case of a financial organization (bank, insurance company, etc.), security officers may be interested in eliminating leakage of sensitive data, such as credit card information, online banking records, etc.Â  That said, attackers can easily get relevant training, ideas and even code excerpts (!) from Deep Web sites and Darknet forums such as Evilzone, Hackaday, Hell, Exodus, Exploit, RuTOR, etc. In particular, there are many sites that offer prosperous trade of DDoS attacks tools and services (âDDoS for Hireâ). And lastly, the Darknet also allows secured communication channels and forums where attackers can plan, coordinate and execute their complex attack campaigns â that are not limited only to DDoS.\nScientia potentia est: Leveraging Darknet Intel\nAs coined by Sir Francis Bacon, âscientia potentia est” which means “knowledge is power”, is probably relevant today more than ever. But surprisingly, about half of businesses today do not trace the Darknet for leaked information (see Figure 2 below).\nSource: Radwareâs web application security report\nApparently, extracting actionable intelligence from the Darknet isnât always straightforward. Why? Keeping an eye on Darknet data requires resources, expertise and tools.Â  Letâs take a closer look at the key reasons:\nFirst, businesses must be able to get visibility into the raw data that may matter to them. It is way more challenging than accessing the Clearnet where websites and web content are freely accessible and searchable.Â  Yes, in the Darknet there are search engines that can show results for Darknet sites, but they are limited by nature.Â  So getting to the right data may involve deploying a sensor network, honeypots, or decoys as well as using faked social accounts. For example, to get raw data from the Darknet, one often needs to be part of specific forums. Not a simple task, as sometimes content is hidden and can be revealed only when you post a message – and you donât want to do that in order to not to get exposed.\n [You might also like: Bad Packets 2017 â A Year in Review]\nSecondly, we need to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.Â  In other words, one needs to have the capacity (in the form of security analysts or automated tools) to do that on a large scale.Â  Without that, organizations may end up spending precious time and energy trying to analyze unstructured data with no clear context, what will end up in total ineffectiveness.\nThird, we need to correlate â get data from both the Clearnet and the Darknet and find the missing links between them.Â  So essentially, examining pieces of information from sources like Facebook, Twitter, etc. may be equally important â for example, many Anonymous hackers have moved to Facebook. Other examples would be Pastebin, where users can upload/store text online (e.g. various user credentials, etc.), Ghostbin (which is used by hacktivists) and others. Ultimately, itâs crucial to take the processed intelligence, and feed it to existing attack prevention tools â DDoS mitigation, WAF, or anti-malware â whether on-prem on in the cloud.\nWhere is it going to?\nUnfortunately, itâs not going to be any easierâ¦ Attackers will depend less on the Darknet for getting exploit packs and DDoS tools, and even less for communicating and coordinating their attack plans.Â  As for them, communicating or making plans in the cyber world through secured channels wonât necessarily require the Darknet. The widespread use of mobile apps like Secret, Signal, Telegram, etc. allow for the confidential exchange of ideas and data.Â  These kind of applications donât save messages metadata, hence messages cannot be traced.Â  Moreover, attackers can write their own Android Package Kit (APK) files – which is the file format used by the Android OS for distribution and installation of mobile apps – and then send a link to it to the group members, so that it doesnât need to be listed in mobile app stores (e.g. Google Play or the like), at all.\nThe final word?Â  In the end, it seems that the cat-and-mouse game of constant pursuit, near captures, and repeated escapes between attackers and security solutions is here to stay – and get to the next levels.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Dark web\', \'Darknet\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/darknet-attackers-operations-room/');

Here is some insight into what we have observed:\n\n\nIoT Botnets\nAttackers continue to leverage IoT devices to build their massive botnets. We have observed attacks that use modified variants of Mirai or Bashlite, and we have seen the rise of new botnets like Reaper, Persirai, Imeij, BrickerBot, Zyklon and WireX.Â  They also search for new attack vectors to employ within these botnets so they can effectively carry out their network-crippling attacks. One of the more notable attack vectors we have found this year was the introduction of the Connectionless Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP) attack vector.\nCLDAP\nCLDAP is an alternative to the LDAP protocol on port 389. Threat actors use it to connect, search and modify internet directories. LDAP servers on Windows support TCP connections while CLDAP works via UDP. Â Because of this, hackers are able to launch reflective and amplified attacks by abusing exposed LDAP servers.Â  The CLDAP request to the LDAP server will return an amplification factor to the targeted IP between 45-55. In the last six months, Radwareâs ERT has observed more than 800 CLDAP reflected attacks.\nTwo of the most common attack trends observed in 2017 were burst attacks and RDoS campaigns. Throughout 2017 we have reported on a number of groups running ransom-based denial-of-service campaigns, specifically targeting the financial industry, along with other attackers targeting the gaming industry and service providers with short burst attacks.\nRDoS â In 2016, ransom was the #1 motivation behind cyber-attacks and this trend continued in 2017. RDoS attacks are financially rewarding to cyber criminals who enjoy large monetary gains for a very small investment. In 2017 Radware observed ransom letters from groups claiming to be FancyBear, XMR Squad, Armada Collective, Anonymous and Phantom Squad. These criminals are using other groupsâ names as a form of intimidation with no intention of following through on their original threat. The average ransom request for an RDoS campaign is normally 1 Bitcoin depending on market conditions.\nBurst â In 2016, burst attacks were a common trend, and like RDoS attacks, continued to be a prominent trend in 2017. Over the year, burst attacks have become more complex and frequent with longer durations. Typically, industries sensitive to service availability are more frequently targeted by attackers using this method. Unlike tradition attacks that are persistent, burst attacks are timely, or random bursts of high traffic rates. These attacks often leave organizations with no time to respond, and when targeting the gaming industry, two seconds of service disruption could result in total game disruption.\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Predictions]\nAnd the targets areâ¦\nSome of the most frequently targeted industries that we have seen this year include service providers and financial institutions.Â  The financial services, both crypto and non-cryptocurrency, have experienced a high number of attacks this year with some of the lead threats originating from hacktivist and financially-driven cyber criminals.Â  Service providers also find themselves as not only the primary target but oftentimes the secondary target for massive DDoS campaigns when the volume exceeds the infrastructure capacity of the original target.\nOther Notable Attacks from 2017:\nJanuary\n\n123-Reg â Just days into the new year, hosting provider 123-Reg experienced a brief outage affecting a number of customer websites.\nSundance Film Festival â The Sundance Film Festival experienced a denial-of-service attack directed at its box office, resulting in a network outage.\nLloyds Bank â A large scale DDoS attack prevented customers at Lloyds Bank, Halifax and the Bank of Scotland from accessing online services.\nHong Kong Brokers- Hong Kong securities brokers reported a service disruption caused by a denial-of-service attack after receiving an extortion email.\nDr. Web / Emsisoft â The websites of Dr. Web and Emsisoft experienced a denial-of-service attack following the release of a Ransomware decrypter.\n\nFebruary \n\nIoT devices turn on a university network â Verizon reported in their Data Breach Digest that an undisclosed university suffered from a denial-of-service attack originating from its own IoT devices.\nTaiwan Brokers â Taiwan securities brokers reported a service disruption caused by a denial-of-service attack after receiving an extortion email.\nAustria Parliament â The parliament said that a group of Turkish hackers were responsible for a denial-of-service attack that knocked out their website.\nBitfinex â Bitfinex was hit by a large scale denial-of-service attack when Bitcoin broke through the $1,100 barrier for the second time in the year.\nLuxembourg Government â Over 100 websites went offline as a result of a denial-of-service attack on Luxembourg government servers.

Bitfinex has experienced significant attacks that have lasted for several days.\n\nMoving into 2018, we expect to see the Denial-of-Service landscape continue to evolve at a steady rate as IoT devices become even more widely accepted and deployed.Â  Over the next year, I expect attackers to find more vulnerable devices to leverage in their botnets due to poor default security standards and continuing to adopt publicly disclosed vulnerabilities within days of disclosure. As the price of Bitcoin and other digital currencies continue to skyrocket, I expect to see more malicious and non-malicious floods taking down exchanges during market volatility. Banks and brokerages will continue to be targeted by DDoS extortionists, and hacktivists will continue launching Denial-of-Service attacks against government agencies as a result of political or social protest.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DoS\', \'IoT\', \'rdos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/bad-packets-2017-in-review/');

Facial recognition became a mainstream reality for those who can afford it. A few months later, Vietnamese cyber security firm Bkav claimed it was able to bypass the iPhone X’s Face ID using a relatively inexpensive $150 mask. The claim is still up in the air and while it has not been accepted to its full extent, no one was actually able to refute the claim based on scientific facts.\n\nFor anyone dealing in AI and security, it emphasized what many of us have held true for a while. We have to use AI, albeit with caution and in its right place. It is a useful tool to have in the armoury to optimize and validate our security posture, but for the actual defence and mitigation a positive security model or behavioural algorithms that are deterministic and predictable are still more effective until the point we will be able to truly trust every possible outcome or decision of Machine and Deep Learning algorithms.\n\nMost applications in use today (successful ones, that is), are based on supervised learning neural nets. The idea behind supervised learning is very simple. They take an input and produce an output where the output is part of a fixed set of labels. For example, it is a common use for email spam filters. It works because the sheer volume of emails provides enough data to ‘learn’ and ‘understand’ which messages are spam, and with time and enough data, a neural net will be able to ‘generalize’ its understanding in such a way that it can classify new messages it has never seen before. Given lots of historical data, the neural net will most of the time make the right ‘decision.’ These sorts of supervised nets can be considered an advanced form of automation. Instead of coding rules into the automation, the automation is coded through data samples and learns by example. They are highly efficient and we shouldn’t underestimate them – they provide a solution for many domains where coding rules would be virtually impossible because of the complexity and our limitations to understand and maintain such complex code as humans. As such, supervised learning opened the door for new applications that were deemed too complex for traditional algorithmic coding.\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Predictions]\n200 Million Images for a State-of-the-Art Face Recognition System\nThe fact that the systems learn by example means that they can adapt over time and keep learning, although not without limits. The learning or memory capability, and related to this its performance, depends on the number of nodes in the neural net. The larger the net, the better its performance. Performance however is only as good as the amount of data you put in – large nets need to be fed a lot and to test the performance of a neural network, you need even more data.\nPerformance vs size of neural network\nTo put this in perspective, Andrew Ng, one of the world’s most eminent data scientists, gave some examples of corpus sizes during one of his presentations:\n\nfor speech recognition systems, you need about 10,000h of audio to train the neural net – this is the equivalent of nearly 10 years of sound\nfor face recognition, a state of the art system uses over 200 million images.\n\nThe WE Economy\nQuality and volume of data and consumers are playing an important role in this new world of data science. We like to believe that services embedded in new technologies and (mobile) apps we are consuming are provided to us for ‘free.’ In reality we are paying with our data to feed and improve neural nets. From pictures we store in a cloud drive to navigation systems we feed with our position and speed, we all contribute to improve the quality of the application while enjoying the ‘free’ service. The more people that use the service, the more data, and the better the service becomes. This new so-called ‘we economy’ allows us all to profit from improvement.\nBut what’s all this got to do with security, and in particular that a positive security model is more effective than any AI system when protecting our applications and infrastructure?\nAdversarial Perturbations\nThere is a problem with neural nets. Nobody understands how the neural net comes to a particular decision and how it generalizes. Generalizing is an important aspect of the neural net because it allows slight deviations of common data patterns to be classified through it. Machine learning is known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where maliciously constructed data is used to force misclassification. Such attacks have been rigorously studied in the context of computer vision.\nResearchers have demonstrated on many occasions that artificial neural networks for image recognition can easily be tricked by small perturbations designed specifically to confuse them on a given image. Researchers also found that a single, universal perturbation could cause a network to fail on almost all images, mistaking a coffee-maker for a cobra or a joystick for a Chihuahua. And that these perturbations, also referred to as adversarial perturbations, can be so tiny that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. That’s alarming and shows that these systems are not as robust as one might think.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nWhile attackers are allowed mistakes while using AI to generate new attacks, the defence system that is supposed to block those attacks has zero margin for error – even the slightest error and you might be looking at what could be considered the next Equifax breach.\nA more general problem with using raw data to identify ‘baseline’ behaviour for anomaly detection, is that one needs to be certain that the input is completely free of any malicious samples. Also known as poisoning, the overall behaviour of the neural network can be biased before you even start using it. It’s a classic input/output problem – in essence the system isn’t broken, it’s just the data it’s dealing with won’t give the desired outcome.\nUnsupervised learning neural nets provide another approach to the anomaly detection problem. As opposed to supervised learning, they do not label outputs and do not require training sets. Unsupervised learning is good at discovering the hidden structure in unlabelled data and hence great for finding anomalies in large pools of unstructured data. However, because there is no labelled input used to train the learner, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output. This means that a large enough amount of malicious data in the pool will go undetected as it would never be considered an anomaly, rather it will be considered as a class of its own.\n [You might also like: Chatting With IoT Bots]\nStatistical Behavioural Detection\nStatistical behavioural detection models have been in use for a long time in the detection of anomalies in traffic patterns and behaviour. Statistical behaviour detection systems are modelled very closely to their problem. It makes them very specific and by consequence cannot be applied to a large set of problems. However, because they model the actual problem they do not need to be trained using very large sets of data and while they can be complex, they are deterministic and humans are able to interpret and understand the decisions made by the system. They are predictable and the parameters for the model can be tuned manually while fine-tuning can be done automatically without too much fear of generating false positives.\nThe major difference between both solutions is that neural nets are a more general approach and the output cannot be blindly trusted to be used in a system for mitigation or enforcement.\nOn the other hand, statistical behavioural detection models cannot be applied generally. They are designed to solve or detect a very specific problem. Take for example SYN attacks and the behavioural detection of TCP protocol flags. Statistical detection is modelled very closely on the expected behaviour of the protocol which is described in RFC793. We know what to expect in terms of the ratio of the number of SYNs versus the number of ACKs during the lifetime of a legitimate TCP session between two peers. An exception is therefore easily detectable as an anomaly or attack and false positives are rare because of the algorithm’s intimate modelling based on the knowledge of the protocol.\nA neural net can deduce the same, but because it is so general, it will require much more data to train the network before it can start to detect, and it will be much more difficult to predict the certainty of any reported exception without further investigation. Also, because it is so general, it is far easier to poison a neural net where a statistical behaviour algorithm can by design not be poisoned.\nPositive Security Models – the Human Intelligence\nClosing the loop on positive security models. A positive security model consists of rules that specifically allow certain types of traffic or behaviour. It does not generalize in terms of the input and does not evolve over time, unless adapted by the authority that maintains it. Rules are encoded by humans and they are prone to human error, something which AI and statistical behaviour is less prone to. However, positive security models are very predictable and deterministic and will under no circumstance allow unwanted traffic. That is, if the encoding was strict enough to detect unwanted traffic and prevent false positives, which again comes down to human error.\nBringing Home the Case for AI in Cyber Security\nPositive security models are the best way to protect yourself from cyber-attacks where there is a zero-margin for error. But it requires a lot of human intelligence to cover all bases and avoid false positives.\nStatistical behaviour modelling is best used in automated mitigation based on anomaly detection when the behaviour is known (such as described in RFCs). It allows immediate enforcement with very little human effort and with less probability to false positives compared to AI, and no risk of poisoning. But it is not universally applicable and multiple different behavioural algorithms might be required to cover more complex behaviour and risks.\nThe case for AI comes in the area of the very complex, where modelling is virtually impossible. One example is predicting behavioural patterns of users on a network such as in UEBA (User and Entity Behaviour Analytics).\nAI also helps us humans to see more clearly in the ever-growing amount of events and data we are collecting from our infrastructure and end-points, and creating associations where we never thought there would be. AI is helping security teams detect anomalies and potentially malicious traffic or events without too much human effort or intelligence. After interpretation and validation, the information retrieved through Big Data and Deep or Machine Learning systems will help security operations improve the positive security model and increase the overall defence capability.\nMachine or Deep Learning and AI in general is to be considered an integral part of our security strategy going forward. It allows us to cover more bases and detect gaps in our current security posture whether it is on your premises, in the cloud, by yourself or by security solution providers.\nAI is a great tool in many aspects and it is very widely applicable. AI is already impacting the economy in many ways so it’s easy to understand why Andrew Ng calls it ‘the new electricity.’\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AI\', \'automation\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/ai-considerations-cyber-defence-automation/');

Can we assess leading indicators of new attack techniques and motivations to predict what 2018 will bring? The answer is a resounding “yes.” We believe 2018 will be the Year of Automation—or, more precisely, big, bad attacks on automated technology processes. Here are four reasons why.\n\n\nPrediction 1: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Is Weaponized\nElon Musk recently made headlines for suggesting we should be more worried about AI than North Korea. Musk’s comment speaks to the risk of robots playing games and beating humans. It also reinforces fears that the human brain can’t outperform or keep pace with certain kinds of automation. The truth is that no one yet knows exactly what AI can do for humankind. What happens if AI falls into the wrong hands?\nThere is evidence that 2018 could be the year it happens. We are already facing a barrage of bad bots fighting good ones. The black market for off-the-shelf attacks is maturing. Anyone responsible for network or application security will experience firsthand just how automated cyber-attacks have become. It will become apparent that humans simply can’t process information quickly enough to beat the bots.\nThe only hope will be to fight AI with AI. Most cyber-security applications already use some form of AI to detect attack patterns and other anomalies. Such capabilities are used in various domains—from host-based security (malware) to network security (intrusion/DDoS). What all share is the ability to find and exploit meaningful information in massive collections of data.\n [You might also like: 2017’s 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 1)]\nWhite and black hats alike are continually hunting for vulnerabilities and zero-day attack concepts. Both can use machine learning/deep learning to collect information and either fix the problem or, in the case of unethical hackers, create one. A prime example is finding vulnerabilities in source code, reversed code or binary code and identifying suspect pieces of code that might lead to the discovery of new zero-day concepts. These are activities that can be easily automated—as illustrated by the discovery of the Reaper botnet in late 2017.\nIt now feels like a race. Who will find the vulnerabilities first?\nSometimes organizations make it too easy for unethical hackers to win. How often have we seen attacks on vulnerabilities disclosed a few weeks or even several months before? WannaCry, for example, exploited the reality that people fail to upgrade in a timely manner. Hackers were able to launch massive, untargeted attack campaigns without the need to perform any research. The same was true with the Equifax breach, which exploited a recently discovered vulnerability. These opportunities were simply handed to attackers on a plate.\nOther hackers—particularly those tasked with state-sponsored attacks—are more ambitious. For them, research is paramount. Consider that Vladimir Putin is on record stating that the nation that achieves an AI breakthrough will be the nation that achieves world domination.\nWill AI be used to jam communication links, plunge cities into darkness, set oil rigs on fire or destroy emergency services? Those may be worst-case scenarios, but they point to the need for every enterprise to consider how AI could both damage and protect it.\nPrediction 2: APIs Come Under Attack\nAPIs are a double-edged sword for modern applications such as mobile apps, IoT apps and third-party services embedded into existing applications. They simplify architecture and delivery but introduce a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, API vulnerabilities still do not get the required visibility. All of the risks that affect web applications also affect web services, and yet traditional application security assessment tools such as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Static Application Security Testing (SAST) either don’t work well with APIs or are simply irrelevant to them.\nAPIs will be at the heart of many AI capabilities. Radware believes that protecting them may be the biggest problem of the future of the Internet. Here’s just a brief example of the areas of concern for APIs—many of which will be attacked in 2018:\n\nTLS is required to secure the communications between the client and APIs for transport confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.\nTCP Termination for network evasion attacks detection where IP fragmentation is applied.\nHTTP protocol parsing and enforcement of HTTP RFC protects against various HTTP attacks such as NULL byte injection, encoded attacks, HRS attacks, content-type mismatch, etc.\nTraffic normalization for evasion attacks detection. Encoded attacks can easily bypass security solutions.\nMessage size policy enforcement on HTTP message, body, headers and JSON/XML element sizes secures the application against buffer overflow attacks, resource exhaustion and other availability attacks on API infrastructure.\nAccess control policy management with:\n\nIP-based and geo location restrictions when relevant\nAccess restriction to particular APIs where, for example, some APIs should be exposed for public access while others are just for internal use.\nAccess restrictions to specific HTTP methods where the set of operations which are allowed for certain users are prohibited for other users or sources. (For example, a user can generate a license but cannot delete the license once generated.)\n\n\nStrong typing and a positive security model provide tight protection to the API infrastructure. It will be impossible to generate most of the attacks if, for instance, the only allowed value type in the JSON element is an integer with the value rage of 1 – 100.\nXML/JSON validity check and schema validation is an extremely important security protection. Types, value ranges, sizes and order of XML elements must be configurable.\nRate-based protection per application or per API is an important protection against service abuse (for informational APIs), brute-force attacks and DoS attacks.\nXSS protection should be based on rules and signatures of known attack patterns.\nSQL and no-SQL injection protections can be achieved by sanitizing and validating user inputs and via rule-based attack detection.\nSession management can be used to protect the API key, which is posted as a body argument or in the cookie.\nData leak protection is essential to making sure error messages and sensitive information is not leaking out to the potential attacker\nDDoS protection is key to preventing and mitigating a wide variety of DDoS attack techniques that may exploit API vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nPrediction 3: Proxies Fall Prey to Three Types of Attacks\nRadware predicts three proxy-based attack vectors worth noting: attacks against the CDN proxy, watering hole attacks and side channel attacks.\n [You might also like: 2017’s 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 2)]\nAttacking the CDN Proxy\nNew vulnerabilities in content delivery networks (CDNs) have left many wondering if the networks themselves are vulnerable to a wide variety of cyber-attacks. Here are five cyber “blind spots” that will be attacked in 2018—and how to mitigate the risks:\n\nIncrease in dynamic content attacks. Attackers have discovered that treatment of dynamic content requests is a major blind spot in CDNs. Since the dynamic content is not stored on CDN servers, all requests for dynamic content are sent to the origin’s servers. Attackers are taking advantage of this behavior to generate attack traffic that contains random parameters in HTTP GET requests. CDN servers immediately redirect this attack traffic to the origin—expecting the origin’s server to handle the requests. However, in many cases the origin’s servers do not have the capacity to handle all those attack requests and they fail to provide online services to legitimate users. That creates a denial-of-service situation. Many CDNs can limit the number of dynamic requests to the server under attack. This means they cannot distinguish attackers from legitimate users and the rate limit will result in legitimate users being blocked.\nSSL-based DDoS attacks. SSL-based DDoS attacks leverage this cryptographic protocol to target the victim’s online services. These attacks are easy to launch and difficult to mitigate, making them a hacker favorite. To detect and mitigate SSL-based attacks, CDN servers must first decrypt the traffic using the customer’s SSL keys. If the customer is not willing to provide the SSL keys to its CDN provider, then the SSL attack traffic is redirected to the customer’s origin. That leaves the customer vulnerable to SSL attacks. Such attacks that hit the customer’s origin can easily take down the secured online service.\n\nDuring DDoS attacks, when web application firewall (WAF) technologies are involved, CDNs also have a significant scalability weakness in terms of how many SSL connections per second they can handle. Serious latency issues can arise. PCI and other security compliance issues are also a problem because they limit the data centers that can be used to service the customer. This can increase latency and cause audit issues.\nKeep in mind these problems are exacerbated with the massive migration from RSA algorithms to ECC and DH-based algorithms.\n\nAttacks on non-CDN services. CDN services are often offered only for HTTP/S and DNS applications. Other online services and applications in the customer’s data center, such as VoIP, mail, FTP and proprietary protocols, are not served by the CDN. Therefore, traffic to those applications is not routed through the CDN. Attackers are taking advantage of this blind spot and launching attacks on such applications. They are hitting the customer origin with large-scale attacks that threaten to saturate the Internet pipe of the customer. All the applications at the customer’s origin become unavailable to legitimate users once the Internet pipe is saturated, including ones served by the CDN.\nDirect IP attacks. Even applications that are served by a CDN can be attacked once attackers launch a direct hit on the IP address of the web servers at the customer’s data center. These can be network-based ﬂood attacks such as UDP ﬂoods or ICMP ﬂoods that will not be routed through CDN services and will directly hit the customer’s servers. Such volumetric network attacks can saturate the Internet pipe. That results in degradation to application and online services, including those served by the CDN.\nWeb application attacks. CDN protection from threats is limited and exposes the web applications of the customer to data leakage and theft and other threats that are common with web applications. Most CDN-based WAF capabilities are minimal, covering only a basic set of predefined signatures and rules. Many of the CDN-based WAFs do not learn HTTP parameters and do not create positive security rules. Therefore, these WAFs cannot protect from zero-day attacks and known threats. For companies that DO provide tuning for the web applications in their WAF, the cost is extremely high to get this level of protection. In addition to the significant blind spots identified, most CDN security services are simply not responsive enough, resulting in security configurations that take hours to manually deploy. Security services are using technologies (e.g., rate limit) that have proven inefficient in recent years and lack capabilities such as network behavioral analysis, challenge-response mechanisms and more.\n\n [You might also like: Pandora’s Box: Auditing for DDoS Vulnerabilities, Part I]\nFinding the Watering Holes\nWaterhole attack vectors are all about finding the weakest link in a technology chain. These attacks target often forgotten, overlooked or not intellectually attended to automated processes. They can lead to unbelievable devastation. What follows is a list of sample watering hole targets:\n\nApp stores\nSecurity update services\nDomain name services\nPublic code repositories to build website\nWeb analytics platforms\nIdentity and access single sign-on platforms\nOpen source code commonly used by vendors\nThird-party vendors that participate in the website\n\nThe DDoS attack on Dyn in 2016 has been the best example of the water-holing vector technique to date. However, we believe this vector will gain momentum heading into 2018 as automation begins to pervade every aspect of our life.\nAttacking from the Side\nIn many ways side channels are the most obscure and obfuscated attack vectors. This technique attacks the integrity of a company’s site through a variety of tactics:\n\nDDoS the enterprise’s analytics company\nBrute-force attack against all users or against all of the site’s third-party companies\nPort the admin’s phone and steal login information\nMassive load on “page dotting”\nLarge botnets to “learn” ins and outs of a site\n\nPrediction 4: Social Engineering Gets Automated\nSocial engineering is the use of deceptive techniques to trick individuals into providing information or access to systems. Often the techniques take advantage of normal human impulses, such as the desire to be helpful and kind. One of the most common examples is attackers posing as helpdesk representatives and calling employees to request their login credentials. Social engineering has long been a challenge to security. What’s changing now is the risks of automation transforming human behavior into vulnerabilities. Automated social engineering makes it possible to do two things:\n\nExploit human inputs into automated processes and cause them to make automated processes to work against us or on behalf of the perpetrator.\nAccelerate the speed and effectiveness of longstanding social engineering methods such as phone calls, emails, texts and even conversations.\n\nThese realities have already emerged as large automation issues. Dropbox, Amazon Web Services and Google have all announced huge outages caused by human interaction errors with automated processes with either networking or application changes. Can 2018 exploits of such human error vectors be far behind?\n [You might also like: Pandora’s Box: Auditing for DDoS Vulnerabilities, Part II]\nStriving for Cyber Serenity: Is the Best Behind Us?\n2017 was a monumental year. The discovery of BrickerBot marked the first time a software-based botnet would render a physical (IoT) device permanently unusable. It also foreshadowed a new genre of botnets and attack techniques that automate dastardly deeds. The WannaCry and NotPetya ransom attacks that followed each demonstrated crude forms of automation.\nThe conclusion we can draw is this: If growth of attack surface, techniques and means continues into 2018 through various attacks on automated technologies, the best years of security of our systems may be behind us. As we move into 2018, Radware offers up two key questions: How will the rise of automation fuel corresponding rises in new vectors for exploits? And, given the threat landscape, how can we develop tools and techniques today to protect ourselves from these technical, somewhat arcane threat vectors so that we may all live securely and peacefully?\nInternet-connected devices are being deployed in virtually every aspect of our lives. Yet they are largely implemented in an insecure manner—often prompting decay to insecure architectures or configurations. The result is an environment in which automated attacks can and will thrive. Let us hope that 2018 will be the year when our collective societies learn how to transform the threat equation into a reasonable problem and abate the ominous signs before us all.\nUntil then, we urge you to pay special attention to weaponized AI, large API attacks, proxy attacks and automated social engineering. As they target the hidden attack surface of automation, they will no doubt be very problematic.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AI\', \'Artificial Intelligence\', \'ddos\', \'IoT\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/cyber-security-predictions-2018/');

Because the industry deals with quality of life issues across the spectrum, access to real-time data, especially sensitive data such as patient records, requires both the security and availability of in-house, Web, mobile, or cloud applications.\n\nTo understand what C-level security executives think about overcoming both these technological challenges while managing processes and people, Radware surveyed over 600 chief information security officers (CISOs) and other security leaders across six continents. This article provides an overview of key findings from Radware’s web application security report: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World.\n\nTHE DIGITAL PATIENT\nThe digital transformation has led to a staggering amount of video and images produced by the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector has created a virtual always-connected world of medical equipment devices that continually transmit unstructured, and potentially unsecure, data 24/7/365. Beyond the data explosion, the healthcare sector must comply with a broad, highly specific set of governmental- and industry-led regulations and standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, local regulations like the FDA guidelines in the US) that control the collection, use, sharing and transmittal of sensitive personal and clinical information.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\nHealthcare providers have made large CAPEX investments in sophisticated medical equipment. Due to their long lifecycle, many of these devices are connected to old, unpatched systems. In fact, some still run on Windows XP.\nOften, IT administrators cannot update or patch these systems for fear of voiding the device’s warranty, making equipment manufacturers a weak link in the medical industry when it comes to securing the environment.\nAs more data moves through networks within the four walls and out, the healthcare segment struggles to keep up with needed security strategies, technologies and resources that address the level of sophistication fueled by digitization. Data breaches, ransomware and security vulnerabilities such as exposed websites, unencrypted mobile applications, phishing and more have exposed tens of millions of patient and medical records in 2017 alone.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIt stands to reason that the healthcare sector would invest in skills, tools and solutions that protect their applications and environments. Yet, of nearly 200 security executives surveyed from the healthcare sector (almost 90% having executive authority to direct security activities and investments) found that healthcare lagged behind other industries such as retail and financial services when it comes to mitigating risk. Just 27% of respondents had confidence they could safeguard patients’ medical records even though nearly 80% are required to be compliant with governmental regulations.\n [You might also like: Retail’s #1 Demographic This Holiday?

Nearly two-thirds of respondents have little to no confidence they could rapidly adopt security patches and updates without having an operational impact while 70% said less than 50% of data loss incidents over the past 24 months were fully tracked and patched (see Figure 1).\n\nWhile 68% of respondents invested somewhat or significantly in security controls following major industry data breaches or attacks, only 21% use API gateways, 23% WAFs and only 29% use both. Additionally, less than 40% analyze API vulnerabilities prior to integration while less than 40% feel that they could detect or mitigate against attacks such as Brute Force, Web scraping, encrypted Web or API manipulations. \n•	Only 25% of respondents are fully aware of changes made to in-house applications and APIs within their software development environment.\n•	Sixty-one percent cannot track data shared with third-parties once it leaves the corporate network and 57% do not inspect data that is being transferred/returned via APIs.\nTHE RISE OF EMERGING THREATS\nBeyond addressing existing threats and vulnerabilities that have impacted the healthcare industry over the years, many respondents see the growing threat from emerging technologies. Bots, as with other industries, are becoming more dominant from a generated traffic perspective, with 36% of network traffic in healthcare being bots. However, only 20% of respondents can identify with certainty whether the 36% are good or bad bots. \nBecause there is more encrypted traffic in healthcare, there is a significant concern regarding encrypted (SSL/TLS) threats and attacks on the application layer. Of all attacks, 41% of respondents indicate that Layer 7 DDoS attacks have occurred more frequently over the past 12 months, though only 30% are confident or very confident they could mitigate one of these attacks against the application layer. Sixty-two percent acknowledge that it would be most difficult to prevent, detect and contain these type of attacks.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Healthcare\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/12/healthcare-web-application-security/');

However, there are a few key questions to ask in order to make sure you’re not paying too much.\nAs DDoS attacks grow more frequent, more powerful, and more sophisticated, many organizations turn to DDoS mitigation services to protect themselves against attack. DDoS protection vendors range in all shapes and sizes, from dedicated DDoS mitigation providers to CDN vendors who add website DDoS protection, to ISPs who resell DDoS protection as an add-on. As a result, the quality and cost of such service can vary wildly, and many customers end up purchasing protection packages that are either inadequate, or too big for their needs, resulting in unnecessary costs.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nHere are five questions to ask your DDoS mitigation vendor to make sure that you’re getting the protection that you need, without overpaying:\n\n1. How much traffic do you really need?\nThis is the biggest pitfall – and arguably the biggest reason for overpaying – is buying protection packages that are too large.\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nDDoS protection packages are usually sold in price tiers according to traffic volume. The traffic volume you purchase should correspond the volume of legitimate traffic that your website handles on a normal basis.\nIf you’re not sure about how much traffic you need, you can find out by looking at traffic statistics on your routers or your web servers, and see how much traffic you see on a regular basis.\n2. Are you paying for bad traffic?\nOnce you’ve determined how much traffic you need, find out what type of traffic you’re paying for. When you are under a DDoS attack, traffic volumes increase exponentially within a short time. Therefore, it is important to know whether you are paying for legitimate traffic or attack traffic.\nLegitimate traffic is the normal user traffic that is supposed to reach your website. A legitimate traffic payment model ensures that you pay only for legitimate user traffic. Attack traffic, on the other hand, is malicious traffic by hackers intended to overwhelm your website.  An attack traffic payment model means that you pay for all traffic reaching your website, legitimate or not.\nPaying for attack traffic is particularly a concern if you rely on your CDN provider, your ISP, or your public cloud host for DDoS protection, because these providers charge customers according to the amount of traffic. In such cases you will essentially be paying your provider to be attacked, which can quickly escalate to tens of thousands of dollars (or more) per attack.\nIn order to protect yourself against such surcharges, it is important to make sure you have cost protection in case of a DDoS attack. Depending on the provider, such price protections might be called ‘cost protection’, ‘unmetered DDoS protection’, or ‘legitimate traffic payment model’.\n3. Does it include application-layer DDoS protection?\nBroadly speaking, DDoS attacks are divided into network-layer attacks and application-layer attacks. Network-layer attacks are based on layer-3 and layer-4 protocols such as TCP and IP, and include attack vectors such as TCP SYN floods, UDP floods, IP fragmentation attacks, and others. Application-layer attacks, on the other hand, refer to layer-7 DDoS attacks such as HTTP floods or low-and-slow DDoS attacks.\nMany DDoS protection vendors – especially ISPs and public cloud providers – only provide protection against network-layer (L3/4) attacks, and do not protect against application-layer attacks at all. Others – particularly CDN-based DDoS vendors – require that you subscribe to expensive add-on services in order to receive application-layer protection.\nModern DDoS protection requires that you be protected against both network-layer and application-layer attacks, and neglecting application-layer defenses will leave you exposed to attack – particularly for public-facing web applications.\n4. Are you protected against SSL DDoS attacks?\nAs more and more web traffic is encrypted, SSL-based DDoS attacks are becoming increasingly more frequent and more harmful. SSL DDoS attacks are particularly potent because they demand large amounts of computing resources from target servers. A single SSL request can require up to x15 more resources from the target server than from the origin computer. As a result, a small attack can result in crippling damage.\n [You might also like: 4 Ways Rate Limiting is Losing You Business]\nProtection against SSL-based DDoS attacks is increasingly important. However, there are still some DDoS vendors which do not provide this type of protection at all. Other vendors – in particular CDN vendors – charge extra fees for SSL traffic (thereby increasing the cost) and require that customers share their full SSL keys (thereby harming user privacy), and decrypt all SSL traffic on the cloud (thereby creating much latency).\nIt is imperative, therefore, for organizations to make sure they are protected against this potent form of DDoS attacks, and that the protection offered does not impede regular user traffic.\n5. Beware Hidden Costs on the Public Cloud\nFinally, once you have all your DDoS protections in place, you need to make sure that there are no hidden costs in your policy that can add up to a nasty surprise when the bill is due, especially if you use public cloud infrastructure for your web applications.\nAs more organizations migrate their workload to the cloud, it is increasingly popular to ancillary use cloud DDoS services such as load balancing, CDN, storage and databases. Many of these services are charged by the amount of traffic or requests. In case of a DDoS attack, the traffic that goes through these services will skyrocket, as will their associated costs…\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nSome cloud providers provide limited cost protection against network level DDoS attacks, but that usually does not include application-level DDoS attacks (such as HTTP floods) and ancillary services. In case of an attack, these hidden costs can add up to significant amounts.\nThe best approach, therefore, is to block bad traffic before it ever reaches the public cloud, so you don’t get charged for cloud infrastructure services. Check your terms to see if you’re covered against such attacks, and consider how you can protect yourself.\nWhat to look for in a DDoS solution\nUltimately, effective protection requires that organizations receive the best coverage, tailored to their needs, at a budget they can afford. Robust defenses must protect against both network-layer and application-layer DDoS attacks, as well as providing protection against increasingly common SSL-based attacks.\nHowever, in order to control costs, organizations should make sure that they are not paying for more traffic than they need, that they are paying for legitimate traffic only, and are not paying any hidden costs, especially if you’re using public cloud infrastructure. Check your DDoS protection bill to make sure that this is indeed the case.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"5 Questions to Ask About DDoS Pricing\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/5-questions-about-ddos-pricing/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Eyal Arazi\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ddos-pricing-questions.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1025,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-11-29\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-11-29\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'pricing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/5-questions-about-ddos-pricing/');

All of those impacts bring potentially high costs. The first step to understanding and managing the cost of cyber-attacks is to do everything you can to understand the potential impact and build an effective incident response team so you can rein in these “parasites” and limit damage to your business.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nKey Considerations:\n\nRemember that crisis management is different than routine management- processes and objectives may be different\nUnderstand the impact on various arms, draw the lines of what can be absorbed\nKnow that such events go beyond the IT only. It isn’t an IT-related issue, and require multiple executives’ attention and collaboration\n\n\nCalculating the Cost of Cyber-Attacks\nDespite the prevalence of cyber-attacks, Radware’s research has revealed that the vast majority of the world’s security experts (73%) have not devised a formula for calculating the financial impact of the attacks they suffer. Rather, they rely on estimates. Unfortunately, those estimates tend to be significantly lower than the findings of those who calculate actual costs. Most security experts (54%) estimate the impact of each cyber- attack at less than $100,000; only 12% estimated the cost of an attack to be $1 million or more (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: How much do you believe an attack costs your business?\nSimilarly, Radware has uncovered differences across business sectors. While educational institutions continue to underestimate attack costs, healthcare, government and technology organizations are well aware of the risks. Indeed, such organizations provide estimates that are five times higher than education respondents’ estimates. For healthcare and government, this better understanding of risk may be associated with the sensitive nature of the information under their care. Respondents from retailers provided an above-average estimate of $800,000 per attack. After all, retailers depend on optimal service availability to run their operations; once hit with an attack, losses are immediate. Surprisingly, financial services organizations provide a relatively moderate estimate of just $500,000 per attack.\nFigure 2: Estimated cyber-attack cost by sector\nOrganizations that do calculate monetary consequences of attacks cite a number of factors that they take into account. For at least half, reputational damage and revenue loss are factors. Other drivers include SLA fees, legal damage, compliance fees and processing of unwanted traffic. The average cost among businesses that calculate the impact of a cyber-attack is almost double the estimate of other businesses: $1.1 million versus $620,000.\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\n\nPlanning a Cyber-Combat Strategy\nRadware inquired how organizations respond to such incidents.\nForty percent of global respondents still lack a formal incident response plan. \nThat is a dangerous shortcoming. After all, cyber-attacks by definition disrupt “business as usual.” Of course, not all attacks are created equal. Some actually cause serious disruptions that pose a potential threat to the business—and must be handled immediately. How can you tell which attack you are dealing with?\nStep 1 – Map Your Risks\nYou may be spending significantly on penetration testing and the latest technology for endpoint protection all the way down to BYOD mobile phones. Even so, you may be overlooking critical gaps. Think about everything. Use a bidirectional process where you draw your organization from the inside out, understanding your current information security architecture and looking for vulnerabilities. Consider who might want to hurt you, why and what means they may have to do so. These actors may include hacktivists, ransomers, competitors or even disgruntled insiders or customers.\nStep 2 – Understand the Impact\nSome costs can be easily added to the equation: What’s the cost of a minute of downtime? An hour? Are there any legal fees or compliance fines you would face if compromised? What would be the daily cost of investigating an attack (factor in-house labor as well as the costs of executives’ attention and technology partner services)?\nOther financial impacts are harder to pin down – for example reputational impact, which can vary depending on the severity of the attack and how much time your organization spends in the headlines.\nStep 3 – Prioritize Critical Missions\nAfter estimating the different impacts, it becomes easier to determine what is essential for the organization to continue functioning. Prioritize business procedures and processes, engaging executive management for both their input as well as their endorsement and resource allocation. As much as possible, use key performance indicators to help measure the efficiency of the incident response plan.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nStep 4 – Choose Your Squad\nOnce you have defined the critical processes, identify the dedicated personnel to run them. The incident response plan cannot be the sole purview of the cyber security team; other key players in the organization must also know how to orchestrate critical missions when enmeshed in a crisis. For the information security aspects of the breach, your team must include the best security experts in the organization. They should not only know how best to configure the product, but also know how to think like a hacker.\n [You might also like: Ask Yourself: Do I Need an Emergency Response Plan? WHY?]\nThe “textbook” incident response team has system administrators who are very familiar with IT resources and how to back up data; network administrators who know network protocols and can dynamically reroute traffic; and information security personnel who know how to thoroughly track and trace security issues as well as perform post-mortem analysis of compromised systems.\nStep 5 – Test, Revise, Adapt\nAn incident response plan is never “complete.” After all, the threat landscape is dynamic. So is every business and its network, information and collection of vendors it relies on to support operations. When a crisis occurs, there is no room for error; your response must be rapid and decisive. To meet that high standard, routinely stage “emergencies” and practice responding to them. In doing so, your organization will develop a methodology that fosters speed and accuracy while minimizing the impact of unavailable resources and potential damage should an actual crisis occur. These simulations should involve not only the cyber-security response team but also those responsible for the communications plan, along with your technology partners, service providers and relevant executive leaders.\nFigure 3: Do you have a cyber-security emergency response plan? If yes, which of the following practices does your plan include?\nIn security, it is generally wise to invest in prevention over detection. With cyber-attacks likely to impact every business in some capacity, preparation is a major step toward mitigating successfully and minimizing the financial, reputational and legal havoc an attack can wreak.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Emergency Response\', \'incident response\', \'Risk\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/understanding-cost-of-cyber-attacks-on-business/');

Bots.', 'Daniel Smith', '2017-11-16', 'More than half of all internet traffic is bot-driven.Â  That means, if you have a website, you have experienced bots in one way or another. Bots are automated software that interacts with your website for a number of different reasons, both in a legitimate and illegitimate way.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIn general, there are two different types of bots, the good and the bad. Good bots are bots like Search Bots, Crawlers and Feed Fetchers. Specifically, GoogleBot is a bot used by Google thatâs known as a spider and used to update their search index. Good bots also serve critical functions such as price aggregators or customer service chatbots. However, for every good bot in the world, there is a bad bot wreaking havoc.\nBad bots create significant problems for retailers.Â  They steal intellectual property via activities like web scraping, undercutting or stealing pricing information and disrupting inventory management. For example, Sneaker bots have transcended the sneaker market and are now allowing collectors the ability to purchase multiple pairs of highly anticipated and limited product before a normal user can access the website.\n\nRadwareâs research indicates that bot traffic represents more than half of the internet traffic seen today. Some retailers even see bot activity exceeding 75% of the total traffic among their organizations. Of that bot traffic, 49% is considered to be generated by bad bots. This is problematic considering a third of organizations cannot distinguish the difference between a good bot and a bad one.\nMalicious bots have gotten so bad that this year New York passed a bill, S.8123/A.10713, that makes it a Class A misdemeanor charge for scalpers to use automated retail bots to purchase tickets. This bill came after it was discovered that several 3rd party resellers were able to purchase nearly 40% of the available tickets for a Broadway show, Hamilton, using automated bots.\n [You might also like: Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World]\nToday you can find a number of vendors that are selling automated software packaged for scalping so resellers can take advantage of e-commerce sites. Some of these bots are so advanced that they have the ability to break CAPTCHA and other mitigation techniques.\nAutomated bots also create a problem for analyzing website traffic and user behavior. These automated bots impact traffic data by poisoning the data set, resulting in a reduced quality of analysis and limited optimization.\nDifferent verticals are impacted by bot traffic in different ways. By understanding what bots affect you and what those bots do, it will help you implement a better bot management solution.\nFor retailers, bots are literally everywhere. Radwareâs research indicated that 72% of retailers reported experiencing negative consequences due to web scraping attacks, including gathering of pricing information (56%), help inventory (45%), website copying (39%) and inventory depletion (32%).\nCompletely bot-driven activities include web scraping, web application DDoS, and brute forcing. Non-automated, bot-assisted activities include API manipulation, SQL injections and other attacks like Cross-Site Scripting. Automated bots for malicious purposes can also easily bypass systems like CAPTCHA and other mitigation techniques, presenting most organizations who depend upon tradition detection with serious challenges in combating these bot-related activities.\n40% of respondents in a recent survey claim their organization updates applications at least once per week, posing a great challenge for organizations to keep control of. At the same time, those that develop automated software hire dozens of developers who work around the clock to defeat these changes.\nSneakerheads\nOne of the more notorious activities lately involving automated bots is those used by Sneakerheads, a.k.a. shoe collectors. Sneakerheads use automated bots to purchase limited-edition sneakers. Not long ago, sneakerheads had to be physical. What I mean by this is that before automated bots, it was a contact sport. Sneakerheads would have to travel to shoe stores and often camp out for days just to see what was being released and decide on the spot if they were going to purchase the shoe or not. Because of the hype around specific drops, things turned violent and left shoe companies looking for a new way to release their products. Even in-store releases were susceptible to being backdoored to the highest bidder. Eventually they moved to the internet to prevent physical confrontation as customers walked out of a store. But with any item sold online, with massive hype behind them, opportunists quickly started gaming the system for profit.\nToday sneakerheads are hackers, programmers and tech-savvy collectors. They buy, rent and build custom tools used to automate the process of purchasing shoes with Add-To-Cart (ATC) bots. They target sites with limited product offerings such as Supreme, Nike and Adidas. Some of the more popular bots for sale are All in One (AIO) bot, Another Nike Bot and other customized packages. These bots are constantly being updated to defeat the latest defenses deployed by retailers to prevent the use of automated bots for purchase.\nSneakerheads use the term âcookâ to describe the process of purchasing shoes with an automated bot.\nFor vendors, during a shoe drop their traffic often resembles that of a layer 7 DDoS attack. Supply is never equal to demand and oftentimes websites see hundreds of thousands of sneakerheads attempting to purchase a pair from a limited drop of around 10,000 shoes. Savvy operators will scrape a website prior to the release for information related to the shoe they are looking to purchase.\nThe bigger problem for shoe collectors is opportunists that do not intend to wear their purchase, instead prefer to capitalize on market demand by reselling their inventory. Some sneaker bot operators are able to âcookâ dozens of shoes at a time before a human even has a chance to access the website. For example, a sneakerhead who uses a bot to purchase a pair of V2 Yeezys for $220 can turn around and resell the confirmation for $2,000! Multiply this by a few dozen pairs and it quickly becomes clear why these sneaker bots have become so popular: Profit. And with this profit and opportunity, a sub-industry around reselling shoes was born.\nBecause of this explosive growth in sneaker bots, it has dramatically diminished the chances of the average Joe copping a pair of limited-edition sneakers. Because of this shift, many people have wondered if companies really can ensure a level playing field for their potential customers. Companies that sell sneaker bots often believe that the playing field will only be level once everyone owns a sneaker bot.\n [You might also like: Evolution is the Name of the Game]\nNike attempted to give sneaker bot operators a run for their money this year when they released the Momofuku SB Dunk High Pro. Through its SNKRS app it required those that wanted to purchase a pair to unlock the shoe in the app by scanning the menu of David Changâs Fuku restaurant in New York City. If you didnât have access to the menu, you could simply go to the web version of the menu or scan a SNKRS poster located in NYC. It was believed that this method showed some promise to help combat the growing problem around sneaker bots and automated retail bots in general.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIn general, automated bots can create application performance issues and increase the cost of maintaining your website. The negative impact includes reputation damage. If a standard user is not able to purchase a release at face value due to automated bots, they will be forced to purchase the item from a reseller. This markup on the item will leave the consumer bitter and not likely to return.\nHow do retailers deal with the bot problem?\nBlocking bots in general is a fundamentally flawed strategy. When you block the bots, good bots such as Search Bots, Crawlers and Feed Fetchers cannot do their job, resulting in a negative outcome for businesses.\nBots, crawlers and spammers, using new techniques to disguise malicious traffic, can exhaust resources and scrape sensitive information from websites or cloud-based assets. A good Web Application Firewall (WAF) needs to be able to sniff out these clandestine bots.\nBad bots tend to be financially-motivated. Vendors that sell automated software (like sneaker bots) often have developers on their payroll who work daily to defeat the latest changes to an e-commerce website. They do this so when a new shoe such as Yeezys and Jordans are released, their bots can defeat a websiteâs changing tactics and avoid detection.\nOverall, a bot management solution can help you reduce the negative impact to your website traffic. By using many techniques like fingerprinting, CAPTCHA, IP rate-based detection, in-session detection and terminations, Javascript challenges and dedicated anti-bot solutions, organizations can fortify web applications exponentially and level the playing field for those wishing to purchase items without the aid of automated software.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'automated bots\', \'Bots\', \'Retail\', \'sneaker bots\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/retail-holiday-demographic-sneaker-bots/');

In this blog post I will describe the common DDoS attacks that are launched against HTTP servers.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nFirst, HTTP is running over TCP. As a result, the web server can face many TCP-related attacks. When planning HTTP service protection, it is important to keep in mind that the attack surface is much broader than just the HTTP protocol. Any DDoS attack today is using multiple vectors to create a denial-of-service, and in order to prevent it, one should be able to protect from all of these vector. See also a discussion on more exotic attacks at the end of this post.\n\nThe common TCP network attacks are:\n\nSYN flood – maybe the oldest of them all, but still used as a vector in most attacks. The attacker is sending many SYN packets which are sent to the server. Since the attack does not need to see the return traffic, the IPs do not have to be real and are usually spoofed IPs. This fact also makes it harder to understand where the attack is coming from, and help the attacker to remain anonymous. The SYN attacks techniques have evolved throughout the years, together with the mitigation techniques.\nThe main idea behind a SYN attack, is that every SYN is opening a session in the TCP stack – the stack needs to preserve some memory to keep the session state. Sending a lot of SYN packets can easily exhaust the memory allocated for sessions (the session pool) in the TCP\\IP stack. SYN attacks have grown more sophisticated over the years. The most recent variant is the Tsunami SYN Flood Attack which uses large packets with a TCP SYN bit to saturate the internet pipe while causing damage to the TCP\\IP stack in parallel.\nOther than SYN floods, the TCP network attack surface is exploiting all other TCP flags as well- ACK floods, RST floods, Push-ACK floods, FIN floods and any combination of these bits are all used in various attacks. Attackers will try everything, as long as it has the potential to create havoc.\n\n [You might also like: HTTPS Interception – How To Use It Without Concern]\nThe HTTP L7 attack surface is wide, and consists of several vectors, which will be discussed below. The main difference between the HTTP L7 attacks, and the network attack described above, is the fact that an HTTP transaction requires a valid IP – one cannot spoof an IP for an HTTP request, as the TCP handshake requires the IP to accept and respond to the packets. If you do not own the IP, you will never be able to establish the connection. This difference used to pose a big problem to attackers who wanted to use HTTP attacks, however, in today’s world with the recent IoT botnets that rule its attack surface, owning a large amount of real IP addresses is no longer considered an impossible challenge. Once the connection is established from a real IP address, several options are available for attacks:\n\nGarbage flood – the least sophisticated attack vector is opening a connection to the HTTP port (usually ports 80 or 443) to send garbage binary data to it. Such an attack is usually overlooked in mitigation as the server, as well as the security devices protecting it, are expecting “valid” HTTP traffic. The purpose of this attack is usually to flood internal buffers and queues in the web server, and even in the mitigation devices in front of it. The attack is also sometimes used to saturate the internet pipes, although there are easier attack techniques to do that.\nGET flood – the most common usage of the HTTP protocol is an GET request. The GET flood uses the same GET request method, but in a high volume. The attacker is trying to make the server over-load and stop serving legitimate GET requests. This attack is usually following the HTTP protocol standards to avoid mitigation using RFC fcompliancy checks.\nOther HTTP methods– other than the common GET method, the HTTP protocol allows other methods as well, such as HEAD, POST and more. Attacks using these methods are usually used in parallel to a GET flood, in order to try and attack less common areas in the server code. A POST request is usually larger than a GET request, and as a result a large POST request is less suspicious than a large GET request, and more likely to get to the server un-noticed by the mitigation devices protecting it. This allows more memory consumption on the server, and more chances for denial-of-service.\n\nReverse Bandwidth floods – these attacks are trying to saturate the internet link from “behind” – they are trying to cause the server to send traffic that will saturate the up-link of the server to the LAN or to the internet. Even if a server has just one large page, attackers can send many requests for this specific page. This will make the server send it again and again and saturate the server’s own uplink connection. This technique is used to avoid detection from mitigation devices, who usually measure the inbound traffic for saturation, and not always the outbound traffic as well.\nHTTP fuzzers and misbehaved fields – these attacks are sending garbage or bad values on specific HTTP protocol fields. The attack will send a G3T request (instead of a GET request), send traffic on HTTP version 1,1 (instead of HTTP 1.1) and so on. Another option is to use random values in the field place in the communication. The attackers are trying to crash the web server, which will happen if the server is not checking for the validity of these input values. Note that unlike previous attacks, this attack does not have to consume high traffic volume or high PPS – it is trying to create damage “under the radar” of the mitigation devices.\nLow and slow attack – these attacks consume even lower BW and PPS than the fuzzers. The attack is using very little traffic and thus it is harder to detect. This attack is sending legitimate HTTP traffic, but at a very low pace. The attack will send a GET request using many small packets with a large time gap between them – the attacker will first send the “G” in its own packet, after a while he will send the “E” and after some more time the “T” and so on. While this is a legitimate behavior according to the HTTP and TCP protocols, this behavior is consuming a lot of resources from the server – it has to keep the connection open, waiting for the full request to arrive. Since the connection pool is limited, it is very easy to reach pool saturation, with very little traffic.\nCache bypassing attacks – many web servers today are behind CDNs, allowing faster delivery of the content to the global users around the world. The CDN gives the server owners a false sense of security, since they expect the CDNs to stop any flood before it gets to their server. However, the CDN security measure can be easily bypassed by sending requests for non-cacheable content. Requests for dynamic content as well as non-existing content will make the CDN reach to the servers. The servers can be attacked using all of the attacks described in this post, and the CDN will actually be used as part of the attack itself.\nOWASP top 10 attacks – on top of the above attacks, which are denial-of-service attacks, there are many more HTTP attacks which go deeper into the HTTP protocol, and try to gain other assets from the servers. Attacks such as cross-side-scripting, SQL injections and more are trying to make the server serve content it is not supposed to serve. The top 10 attacks of this nature are known as OWASP top-10. These are usually not denial-of-service attacks, and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides the best mitigation for them. The WAF can be effective as either an on-premises device or a service in the cloud.\n\n [You might also like: DNS Reflective Attacks]\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nOther attacks:\nIt is important to note that protecting the web service itself is not enough to guarantee service. Other attacks can still cause the service to be down. One example is a pipe saturation attack, even with UDP garbage traffic that has nothing to do with HTTP. Another attack is the recent SMB attack that was found in the wild. All these attacks are aiming at the services around the web server – internet pipe, other non-HTTP services offered by the same device, and more, in order to create denial-of-service.\nAnother type of attack is to attack the DNS server that is used to translate the domain into an IP address. Such a method was used in the famous Dyn attack in Oct. 2016 using the Mirai botnet. It is important to note that the attackers were able to cause a denial-of-service to large web sites such as Twitter and Amazon, without sending even a single packet to the web sites’ direction. Instead, the attackers attacked the internet infrastructure that allows users to get to these sites – they attacked Dyn which served as the DNS provider to these services, and caused the sites to go into a denial-of-service state.\nConclusions:\nThere are many HTTP attacks that can cause denial-of-service. The best way to mitigate these attacks is to choose a protection service that can handle all of them – attacks using high bandwidth or PPS, and attacks using low traffic, attacks directly related to HTTP and attacks on related services. The only way to establish real protection against HTTP attacks is to use adoptive services, which evolve and develop over time. Having the right equipment is only half the battle. It is important to work with a security centric company that can provide expert advice under attack, and evolve and develop its tools to handle the evolving attacks. For web service, as well as for the entire internet, every down second counts. Keeping your site always up is not an easy task, but it can be done using the right products.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DNS\', \'HTTP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/http-attacks/');

We pay our bills, do our shopping, communicate with our doctors, buy our groceries, order a taxi, and even order our lunch through ‘apps.’  If you can think of it, there is an app for it. And these apps live on our phones, our desktops, in web portals and even in our internal networks. However, all these apps create new and different types of security challenges for an organization’s network. The speed and complexity inherent in these technological advances expose application vulnerabilities, security risks and skills deficiencies that can compromise sensitive data, devalue the brand, and affect financial performance.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nRadware, in conjunction with Ponemon, investigated the impact of applications on network and application security. We surveyed more than 600 information security professionals across six continents. The intent was to uncover the challenges that these new technologies and rapid-fire application deployments present, ascertain how organizations in different industries identified application-layer and API vulnerabilities, measure the impact that bots have on organizations, and identify how companies combat application layer attacks.\nThe results were alarming.\nThink about it for a second. With how many organizations have you ever shared your address, banking details, or credit card? What about medical information? Now breathe in and understand that 45% of them were hacked. To be more specific, only 27% of healthcare respondents have confidence they could safeguard patients’ medical records. This is not surprising when 52% do not inspect traffic flow to-and-from APIs and 56% do not track data once it leaves the company, as sensitive as it might be.\n\nAre you using your apps on your smartphone, or a desktop web browser? Consider this, we found out that while mobile applications have more consumption, the businesses that roll them out invest less in their security compared to web services. Moreover, nearly 25% of mobile applications undergo changes daily; if not hourly – which is more than double the ratio of their web application counterparts.\n\nNow let’s look at what happens when a company is attacked: Organizations testify that it takes them quite long to react to global cyber campaigns. While hackers create new malware and attack tools every day, and CVEs are disclosed all the time, nearly two-thirds of respondents have little to no confidence they could rapidly adopt security patches and updates without having an operational impact.\n [You might also like: Another Problem I Face: Securing APIs in Continuous Delivery]\nTo overcome the complexity, organizations turn more and more towards automation. More than 70% indicated they are already using (28%) or planning to add (43%) security solutions that are based on machine-learning in approximately 24 months.\nThe need for automation is driven by the astonishing amounts of bot-generated traffic. Nearly 30% of the total traffic of the internet is essentially bad bots – spammers, scrapers, scanners, botnets used for DDoS and whatnot. Unfortunately, a third of organizations to be exact –still cannot make a distinction between the bad and the good bots (like search engine crawlers or chatbots). Not only this is a security issue, this also means that businesses invest in resources to accommodate these bad bots.\nSome bots are sophisticated enough to imitate human behavior and bypass security controls. Advanced solutions that leverage behavioral analytics and fingerprinting technologies can help organizations detect and block these attacks.\nThese bots are able to evade captcha, IP-rate detection, and overcome in-session termination. In the retail industry, bots are even greater a problem: Web scraping attacks plague retailers by stealing intellectual property, copying websites, undercutting prices, holding mass inventory in limbo, or buying out inventory to resell goods through unauthorized channels at markup.\nThis chart gives us a notion of the prevalence of application attacks organizations suffered:\n\nHowever, when they are asked which are the top three most challenging for them to defend against, they indicate that while most do well when it gets to OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, the top concerns are application layer DDoS, encrypted web attacks, and API manipulation:\n\nAPIs are indeed an emerging concern as modern applications rely more and more on integration with third party services. However, the same vulnerabilities of applications apply to APIs as well, but these are harder to monitor. Rapid FaaS (Functions-as-a-Service) evolution is driving API adoption. FaaS (a.k.a. Serverless architecture) offers a model where the operational unit is a set of function containers rather than a web server. These functions are APIs exposed for the client side application, which may invoke these APIs upon relevant client side event. A simple example would be an application on your mobile device that uses the GPS function or reads your Facebook profile. Access violations, protocol attacks, invalidated redirects, parameter manipulations and irregular expressions of JSON/XML are just a handful of API abuse examples.\n\nLet’s look at financial services for a particular example: 72% share usernames and passwords and 58% share payment details via APIs. Yet, 51% do not encrypt that traffic, potentially exposing valuable customer data in transit.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nThe #1 concern however, was HTTP/S DDoS. Attackers are slowly moving away from easy-to-mitigate network layer DDoS attacks and starting to leverage simpler and defensively complex tools such as Layer 7 HTTP and HTTPS flood attacks. HTTP flood attacks are some of the most advanced cyber security threats to web servers as it is hard to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic, thus creating a challenge to rate-based detection solutions.\n [You might also like: How Do You Create a Flight Plan to a Never-Ending Journey?]\nWe are also seeing more attackers attempting to leverage HTTPS floods as the tools become more popular and widely available. Low & Slow application layer Denial-of-Service attacks use slow traffic that appears to be legitimate HTTP requests to pass traditional detection and mitigation systems undetected. In addition, these tools also keep a persistent foothold in the system by sending a standard HTTP command keep-alive to force the server to maintain the open connections.\nThis threat weighs much when it gets to the availability of the application. An availability outage or even degradation for a retailer in the holiday season can result in tremendous financial losses. Although this is known, more than half (53%) of retailers are not confident in their ability to provide 100% uptime of their application services, and 30% suggest they lack the ability to secure sensitive data during these periods.\nAll these application threats jeopardize the efforts organizations invest in end-to-end automation of the application development, rollout and update cycle. This continuous delivery approach is gaining greater adoption among organizations that seek agility in creating and launching new services.\n\nThey rely on automated tools and methods that accelerate operational efficiency, but security, in many cases, is left behind. While 62% reckon it increases the attack surface, less than half say that they do not integrate security into their continuous delivery process.\nWe learned that applications are vulnerable and data is exposed to a greater extent than we imagined. This is mainly due to organizations’ sincere concern that they simply cannot protect them. Humans are bound to make errors and are reaching their capacity of controlling and analyzing all events in their application environments, but AI is still emerging and untrusted, which leaves up with a big gap, and high risk, for all of us to live with.\n\n\nDownload “Web Application Security in a Digitally Connected World” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'WAF\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/web-application-security-research/');

Here are four ways rate limiting is costing you money, and what you can do about it.\nThere’s no point in being coy about it: if you use rate limiting to protect your website, then you’re probably losing business because of it.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n\nRate limiting is a frequently used tool to defend against network and application-level DDoS attacks against websites. When the rate of incoming requests becomes too great for the website to handle, rate limiting is applied to restrict the amount of incoming traffic.\nTo illustrate this concept, picture a public water conduit with clean water flowing through half of it. Now suppose the water being mixed with contaminated water from another river, doubling the volume of the water in the pipe and causing the conduit to overflow.\nTraditional rate limiting will focus on limiting the total amount water flowing through the pipe. As a result, new water (contaminated or not) will be blocked from entering the pipe until the volume goes down. Although this may keep the water flowing, rate limiting measure will not block bad water from entering the pipe (or separate good water from bad water), leaving the entire flow contaminated.\nMost cloud-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) services today use rate-limiting as the standard mitigation method for application-layer (L7) DDoS attacks. However, just because it’s a common practice does not mean that it’s a good way of protecting your website.\nIn practice, rate limiting has significant drawbacks with regards to website performance speeds, which – in turn – impact the revenue generated from the website, and ultimately your company’s bottom line.\n [You might also like: Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?]\nHere are four ways rate limiting is losing you money:\n1. Turning away visitors: Rate limiting restricts the number of connections to the website, which – in turn – restricts the number of visitors to the website. Above a certain traffic threshold, all new connections will be blocked.\nTurning away visitors is particularly a problem during periods of peak traffic, such as holidays, sales promotions, or product launches which generate flash crowds. Instead of helping you protect your website during these critical times of peak revenue, rate limiting actually inhibits your website’s ability to serve visitors.\nAs web page speed is also a factor in Google’s SEO rankings, this means that with rate limiting, customers will be less likely to find, reach, or browse your website.\n2. Decreasing conversion rates: Rate limiting will not only stop new visitors from reaching your website, but will also slow down visitors who are already on your website.\nWebsite performance is a well-known key factor in impacting shopping conversion rates. Forty percent of visitors will abandon a page that takes more than three seconds to load, and studies have shown that a one-second improvement in load-time can improve conversion by 7%.\nThe average web page is now over 3.3 MB in size and generates over 30 TCP connections per page. Rate limiting will inevitably slow web page performance, even for users who are able to connect, because of incomplete connections and page time-outs. These users will be far less likely to convert, meaning that online shopping revenues will be reduced.\n3. Shopping cart abandonment: Another aspect of reduced website performance by rate limiting is shopping cart abandonment. Studies show that almost 70% of shopping carts are abandoned even after customers have already placed products in them. However, 67% of U.K. shoppers and 51% of U.S. shoppers have said that site slowness is the top reason they’ve abandoned a purchase. Using rate limiting will increase page load times, and therefore increase shopping cart abandonment.\nThese figures show that websites that rely on online purchases and shopping have enough of a challenge getting customers to convert even without the added burden of rate limiting. These are pretty compelling numbers to keep in mind when considering rate limiting as a means of protecting your website.\n4. Doesn’t stop the bad guys: Finally, it needs to be pointed out that rate limiting doesn’t actually stop bad traffic from reaching your website. Rate limiting – as the name implies – limits the rate of incoming connections. It is a brute-force mechanism for capping the amount of total traffic.\n [You might also like: Everything You Need to Know About DDoS Attacks]\nHowever, rate limiting does not distinguish between good and bad traffic. Rather, it will just reduce the overall amount of traffic to levels that your server hardware can handle. Moreover, the ratio between legitimate and malicious traffic will not change, and bad traffic will still reach your website. If a DDoS attack is flooding your website with 50% bad traffic, then after applying rate limiting, the ratio of bad traffic will still be 50%…\nGoing back to the water pipe example above, rate limiting will restrict the total amount of overflowing water, but it will not make the water clean, nor will it block contaminated water. Rather, you will still have to deal with a mix of clean and contaminated water – which will usually render all of it unfit for consumption.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nSo what can you do about it?\nIf you’re looking to protect your website without the drawbacks of rate limiting, you should consider going positive.\nRate limiting is an example of a ‘negative’ security model, which is based on identifying bad traffic and restricting it, while by default allowing everything else to go through.\nIn contrast, a positive security model is based on identifying legitimate traffic, and by default blocking everything that does not conform to it. Such defense mechanisms are usually based on behavior-based machine learning technologies, which can establish traffic baselines and build security policies to conform to them.\nWhen it comes to defending your website against application-layer attacks such as HTTP floods and SSL-based DDoS attacks, you need defense mechanisms that can figure out on its own which traffic is legitimate, and which traffic is not, so you don’t have to resort to brute-force methods such as traffic rate limiting.\nThis way, you can ensure that traffic spikes are handled correctly, your website’s online shopping potential is maximized, and your company does not miss revenue as a result of legitimate users being blocked.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Rate Limiting\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/4-ways-rate-limiting-loses-business/');

A hybrid DDoS approach takes a best-of-both worlds approach, combining the immediate response times of premise-based devices, with the capacity and flexibility of cloud services.\nOne of the key ingredients of an effective hybrid DDoS strategy is seamless messaging between on-prem and cloud defenses, to effectively communicate when an attack occurs and smoothly hand off mitigation to the cloud, before pipe saturation occurs.\nMany DDoS mitigation vendors advertise their cloud signaling, which they claim integrate different layers of DDoS protection. However, all-too-frequently, these ‘signaling’ capabilities provide only a rudimentary interface, which does not provide effective protection.\nSo what should you look for in order to distinguish cloud ‘smoke signaling’ from true hybrid messaging?\n [You might also like: Protecting the Multi-CDN Part I: The Security Challenge of Multi-CDN]\nThree questions to ask from your cloud DDoS provider:\n\n\nDoes it include non-volumetric attack detection?\n\n\nThe first question customers should ask of their DDoS protection providers is does their cloud signaling support non-volumetric detection, or is detection based merely on volumetric traffic rates?\nMost DDoS protection vendors detect volumetric attacks using NetFlow forwarding or SNMP traps, based on preset, manually defined traffic thresholds. Once traffic levels hit a certain level (usually defined according to Packets-Per-Second), they trigger their cloud ‘signaling’ to notify cloud scrubbing centers of the attack, and initiate diversion to the cloud using BGP redirection.\nHowever, this approach provides only partial coverage, as it leaves customers exposed to attacks which initially begin as non-volumetric in nature:\n\nOne class of such attacks is Low-&-Slow attacks, which – as their name implies – begin by “flying under the radar” and then quickly overwhelming server resources.\nA second class of attacks is application-layer attacks such as HTTP floods, SSL-based DDoS attacks, or DNS floods, which can come in very quickly before the NetFlow statistics have time to adjust.\nA third class of such attacks is zero-day DDoS attacks, which do not conform to known attack signatures. If no signature exists, then DDoS cloud services will not know how to mitigate the attack.\n\nIn order to protect against such exposure, customers must make sure that detection is based not just on volumetric traffic thresholds, but also on behavior-based DDoS attack detection using behavior-based traffic analysis. This will not only identify attacks and pre-empt diversion before server resources are overwhelmed or pipe saturation occurs, but will also provide protection in case of zero-day DDoS attacks, which do not have a known signature.\n\n\nDoes it transfer attack footprints?\n\n\nThe second question for customers to ask, is once mitigation to the cloud is complete – what happens next? Does their cloud signaling transmit attack footprint information, or will mitigation have to restart once the cloud scrubbing centers kick in?\nTrue hybrid messaging requires that attack footprints be transmitted from premise-based detection to cloud scrubbing centers. Attack footprint details include traffic baseline information (i.e., what traffic looks like when there is no attack) and attack footprint information such as attack sources, pattern signatures, and statistical traffic analysis.\nEffective hybrid messaging enables mitigation to be handed-off seamlessly from premise-based device to the cloud. This way, once diversion to the cloud is complete, the scrubbing centers will automatically receive all relevant detection information, and can begin mitigation without interruption.\nHowever, cloud ‘smoke’ signaling does none of that. Rather, it just alerts cloud scrubbing centers that an attack is going on, and initiates diversion. As a result, once diversion is complete, the detection and mitigation process must start all over again, delaying mitigation and leaving customers exposed in the interim.\nIn order to minimize exposure windows, customers should insist that their cloud messaging include transmission of detailed attack information, so that cloud mitigation can kick in immediately and without delay.\n\n\nWhat are the SLA commitments?\n\n\nFinally, an effective way of telling how confident your vendor is in their own ‘signaling’ technology is to ask what they are willing to commit to in the SLA.\nMost cloud DDoS vendors provide Time-to-Mitigate SLAs. However, the key question to ask in this case is mitigation starting when?\nEffective hybrid signaling should include commitments to two key SLA metrics to minimize exposure windows: Time-to-Detect and Time-to-Divert.\n\nTime-to-Detect SLAs commit to the time period to detect DDoS attacks. This is particularly important in the case of non-volumetric attack detection (which haven’t yet reached the volumetric threshold to begin diversion) and in the case of zero-day DDoS attacks, for which no known signature exists. The Time-to-Detect SLA ensures vendor commitment to timely DDoS attack detection even when pipe saturation is yet to occur, as well as in case of zero-day attacks.\nTime-to-Divert SLAs commit to the time period it takes to initiate diversion once an attack has been detected. Again, initiating timely diversion is crucial in-order to quickly hand off mitigation to the cloud before pipe saturation occurs.\n\n [You might also like: Protecting the Multi-CDN Part II: Approaches for Securing the Multi-CDN]\nIn addition, you should enquire whether your SLA commitments are provided in bulk (i.e., as a single number, end-to-end), or whether your vendor is willing to commit to each SLA promise individually.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIf your DDoS provider is not willing to provide those SLA commitments, that is a highly telling sign about your vendor’s lack of confidence in their own product, and what you might be exposed to as a result.\nAsking your vendor about it\nImplementing a hybrid DDoS attack prevention strategy is not a one-and-done endeavor. Rather, it is a consistent effort to make sure that premise-based and cloud-based defensive layers are aligned and synchronized so as to prevent any cracks in defense and minimize exposure windows.\nUse these questions above to ascertain whether your DDoS mitigation vendor is willing to commit to this level of effort, or are they just blowing smoke.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Is Your DDoS Cloud Signaling Just Blowing Smoke?\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/ddos-cloud-signaling-blowing-smoke/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Eyal Arazi \",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cloud-signaling.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1280,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-11-08\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-11-08\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Mitigation\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/ddos-cloud-signaling-blowing-smoke/');

Ron is a Security Evangelist for Radware, where he helps execute the company’s thought leadership on today’s security threat landscape. Ron brings nearly 20 years of experience in the internet service provider space, most recently as Director of Network Engineering for a global infrastructure and colocation provider. With an expertise in network architectures and DDoS mitigation, Ron has helped design solutions for carriers, enterprises, and cyber security service providers around the world.\nBehind every new hack or data breach, there’s a company scrambling to put out the fire. That’s good news for cyber security professionals with the right skills. However, between shortages in qualified security professionals, evolving attack vectors, and new DDoS mitigation capabilities and deployment models, organizations looking to safeguard themselves can be left in a difficult position when it comes to finding the best talent, whether it be in-house or outsourced.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWhat skill sets are necessary for the 21st century security professional? How is automation affecting the role of security professionals? Where should organizations look to find the best talent? This piece answers all those questions and more.\n\nSeeing that cyber-security solutions are becoming increasingly automated, what will be the role and what skill sets will be required for the next generation of security experts?\nIt’s a case of fighting fire with fire. As threats have become increasingly dynamic and automated, DDoS detection and mitigation solutions are rising to the challenge with their own increase in automation and adaptability. According to Radware’s Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite report, 38% of IT executives throughout the United States and Europe indicate that automated security systems – such as machine learning and AI – will be the primary resource for maintaining cyber security within the next two years.\nBut it presents a catch-22 for the next-generation security professional. As a security professional, when you’re increasingly relying on automation to defend the network, you’re not “practicing” or fine tuning your skill sets. The DDoS mitigation solution is doing a lot of the heavy lifting and the network security professional is receiving and digesting reports. This can create a void in skill sets due to lack of “practice.”\nThere will always be times when a network security professional will have to “jump in” and manually tune or configure a policy or setting. In addition, professionals need to stay afoot of rapidly emerging attack vectors, hackers’ trends and newfangled mitigation capabilities.\n [You might also like: How are IoT Skills different than IT Skills?]\nThe next generation of cyber security professional will become an “orchestrator,” responsible for monitoring and managing an integrated suite of DDoS solutions that form a comprehensive, hybrid system for the organization. Necessary skill sets will include attack signature recognition, policy generation, configurations, vulnerability mapping, attack forensics, etc.\nTo supplement these skill sets and allow security professionals to stay afoot of the threat landscape and provide assistance when she or he has to “jump in,” partnering with a DDoS mitigation vendor that provides 24/7 security services via a team of experts will be increasingly important. With the threat landscape and DDoS mitigation capabilities evolving and expanding so rapidly, it’s difficult for any one organization to have all the necessary in-house expertise when the time calls for it.\nHas the rise of IoT devices and botnets impacted the skills required for security professionals?\nAbsolutely. Given the sheer volume that an IoT botnet can unleash, it means security professionals have to react to new threats immediately. Attack signature recognition and comprehension gains increased importance. Botnet-based attacks underscore the fact that it is incredibly difficult for security professionals to comprehend the full threat landscape.\nTake Mirai for example, considered by most to be the first open source botnet. It’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides security professionals with the ability to study the underlying code, dissect the botnet and therefore develop new countermeasures. However, it also allows hackers to manufacture new versions for nefarious purposes, thereby expanding the threat landscape exponentially.\nAs is always the case, knowledge is power. It’s critical that cyber security professionals stay abreast of these threats via the resources that experts and industry leaders provide.\nAccording to many reports, over the next five years there will be a significant shortage in cyber security professionals. How will that impact organizations’ ability to safeguard themselves?\nThis is a natural progression because both the threat landscape and the network/IT infrastructures they target are growing but the number of cyber security professionals is not increasing as rapidly. Overall, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find good talent. Network and cyber security jobs aren’t drawing as many candidates as other IT and technology-related jobs, such as developers and programmers.\nThis issue highlights the broader topic of how companies manage cyber security in an age of digital transformation, changing regulatory landscapes and dynamic cyber threats. Cyber security isn’t just a manpower game; it’s also a question of expertise. The good news is that expertise can reside both in-house or can be found at a partner.\nFor many organizations, it doesn’t make sense to hire expensive people but rather rely on a partner instead. According to the Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite report, this is becoming an increasingly popular trend. Globally, 32% of respondents say they count on a security provider (such as an ISP or carrier) to provide protection.\n [You might also like: Evolution is the Name of the Game]\nRelying on a carrier, internet or cloud service provider is a popular approach to managing security because it provides a “worry-free” way to manage security with a carrier that the organization has a long-standing relationship with. However, how sophisticated is the ISP/carrier’s security infrastructure? Can it keep the organization up and running even during a large or complex attack? Will it offer the organization a mitigation service, or does it “blackhole” or cut off all traffic while under attack? It’s key to understand how this management practice might inadvertently affect multiple customers’ systems, and managing and interacting with these partners is becoming an increasingly important responsible for security professionals.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nThe third option is engaging with a specialized cyber security vendor to manage across on-premise and cloud solutions. This is becoming increasingly popular if the cyber security vendor provides hybrid protection for the organization’s physical and cloud-based infrastructures, which is critical given the wide array of cyber-attacks now available to hackers.\nGiven recent high-profile incidents involving state-sponsored cyber-attacks and the importance of national security, what role does nations’ militaries/national security agencies play in developing cyber security experts for the private sector?\nSome of the very best network and security professionals I’ve worked with have come from the military and/or government agencies. Often, they train on the most advanced and secure networks in the world and emerge in the private sector with incredible experience. Personally, I believe it’s the best candidate pool.\nHowever, there is talent to be found everywhere; organizations just have to know where to look. Leverage conferences, networking, LinkedIn groups, etc., to uncover the best cyber security professionals. Ultimately, organizations really have to be hunters when it comes to discovering the best people.\nIn addition, organizations should increasingly consider ex-hackers. According to the Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite report, this is becoming an increasingly popular trend amongst IT leaders and C-level executives. In Europe, 58% said they were very or extremely likely to do so, while one out of three U.S. executives expressed their willingness to do so.\nHackers will think outside the proverbial box and can therefore assist with vulnerability mapping and forensics. Further, hackers tend to share information and openly discuss offensive tools and tactics. Most organizations don’t or do so to a much lesser extent.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'automation\', \'ddos\', \'IT\', \'Skills\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/bridging-cyber-security-skills-gap/');

He focuses on security research and risk analysis for network and application based vulnerabilities. Daniel’s research focuses in on Denial-of-Service attacks and includes analysis of malware and botnets. As a white-hat hacker, his expertise in tools and techniques helps Radware develop signatures and mitigation attacks proactively for  its customers.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nBotnets have been getting all the attention since the beginning of 2017, but what other attack vectors are proving popular this year? \nBotnets certainly received a great deal of fanfare after the launch of Mirai in 2016. One reason why was due to two new attack vectors launched by Mirai: GRE floods and DNS water torture attacks. Both of these attack vectors combined with the sheer volume produced by an IoT botnet has proven a challenge to mitigate.\nGeneric routing encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco. GRE mainly encapsulates data  packets  and  routes  them through the tunnel to a destination network that de- encapsulates the payload packets. Sending many GRE packets with large amount of encapsulated data may lead to resource consumption once the victim will try to de-encapsulate them until exhaustion.\nA DNS water torture attack sends a pre-crafted DNS query to the service provider’s DNS server. The malicious DNS query contains random string concatenated previous to the victim’s domain. The DNS server will attempt to get an answer from the authoritative nameserver repeatedly with no success. Sending different false strings with the victims’ domain name will eventually increase the DNS server’s CPU utilization,  making  it unreachable.\nRansom denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks have become popular thanks to financially motivated criminals, in addition to hacktivist groups. Most RDoS groups will request between $1,000 – $10,000 dollars on average and the penalty for missing payment is typically much larger. RDoS is a growing concern as it gains popularity. In 2016, Radware witnessed an exponential increase in the number of ransom threats companies have received from these types of  criminals.\nAnother big reason for its rise is due to the large monetary gain for little to no investment. For example, thanks to DDoS-as-a-service programs that are available on the Darknet, a hacker could launch an attack for as little as $20 for a twenty-minute, 1Gbps attack. In addition, opening a bitcoin account and sending an extortion email costs nothing. Distributing enough ransom letters typically generates at least a few individuals/organizations that are willing to pay.  Some groups don’t even follow through with the attack. Inside the ransom note they claim they will attack leveraging a popular attack vector, such as Mirai, and the victim (aware of the potential damage) will pay. For all these reasons, many opportunists have emerged in 2016/17 looking to spread fear and extort victims for monetary gain.\n [You might also like: The Evolution of the Dark Web]\n Is ransomware’s evolution responsible for its recent resurgence?\nYes it is. Ransomware was first introduced 25 years ago. Traditionally, ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to user data by encrypting the files on an infected computer and demanding payment for the decryption key. Just like in RDoS, the attacker simply distributes a largescale phishing campaign in hopes someone will click on the malicious attachment or link.\nRecently, the idea has evolved and now relies on cryptocurrency as its main form of payment. Ransomware authors are still using malware to encrypt critical data, making it unusable until the user complies by paying a ransom. What has also changed is the delivery method.\nWith the WannaCry attack, the attack did not send out a phishing campaign, but rather used scanners to identify devices that were vulnerable to MS17-010, a Microsoft security update that patched remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s SMB services. Once a computer was infected, a worm replicated itself across the device’s network, targeting other computers. This attack represents an evolution in ransomware attacks: they can now leverage recently disclosed exploits and default credentials to infect a device similarly to the way IoT botnets  spread.\nNot only are authors looking for new delivery methods, they are also looking for new methods to cash in. The latest threat that Radware’s research is witnessing are hackers offering user-friendly attack services; i.e. Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). A novice user can access the Darknet and find several RaaS offerings. Potential criminals can pay a small fee to have access to customizable ransomware platforms. RaaS providers charge a fee for access to the source code, or take a percentage of any profits that are generated. Some even offer ransomware free of charge.\nExpert skills are no longer required to hold victims’ information hostage. Satan is the name of one service that automates the process by allowing users to specify the ransom amount, various multipliers and the    actual creation of the ransom note, completely free of charge. At the end of the process, a user is left with a malicious .exe file that they can send to their victims.\n [You might also like: Internet Censorship / Open Internet]\n Between the Darknet going mainstream, the U.S. government repealing certain privacy rules that prevent broadband providers from selling personal data, and the vulnerability of IoT devices, are you seeing data privacy becoming a bigger concern? \nData privacy is a big concern and it’s becoming bigger. The average user is unaware of their digital footprint, how large it is, and how far back it dates. Online privacy is a two-front battle. You  have the service providers and the online services that have the ability to harvest data about individuals for marketing or law enforcement purposes. Then there are the criminals who hack these providers and services to either sell the data or target an individual directly.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIn 2016, 117 million accounts from LinkedIn were leaked, 360 million from MySpace, 68 million from Tumblr and 127 million from Badoo. These leaks alone compromised over half a billion emails and usernames. This represents a gold mine for hackers who keep databases so they can conduct malicious activity.\nFraud has always been a big business for hackers. Ultimately,  users must take steps to  insure  their own privacy from both providers and criminals. Users must understand how they connect to the Internet, which  data they are  comfortable disclosing, such as  life events they share  on  social media. An  individual might take steps to keep their image or location disclosed, but when a friend posts a tagged picture on Instagram with that individual in the background, this unintentional disclosure becomes data that can be used against that person.\nOnce an individual has a better understanding of what information they are exposing, they can incorporate VPN, security settings and become aware of their surroundings to prevent further information from  being exposed.\nUsers should always be alert for phishing emails and should monitor credit and bank statements, keep their personal devices updated, create strong passwords and use two-factor authentications when possible. File sharing services should be disabled and always verify any company that you’re conducting business with. If personal data is stored on a personal computer, consider encrypted file storage and data backup. And never reuse passwords.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'IoT\', \'mirai\', \'Ransom\', \'rdos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/11/evolution-of-attack-types-vectors/');

Let’s examine how these attacks have evolved and how your company can mitigate them:\n\nDDoS in Review\nA Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack targeting the availability of network resources and applications. Unlike other kinds of attacks, DoS attacks’ primary goal is not so much to infiltrate data, but rather to slow or take down altogether a network device, an application, and/or a website. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the most common variant. In “Eliminating Single Points of Failure, Part 1” Radware’s Louis Scialabba reviews how DDoS attacks work and some instances where DDoS attacks have been in the news (surprise – it’s more often than you think).\n\nWhat Risks Do DDoS Attacks Pose to Enterprises?\nDenial-of-Service attacks affect enterprises from all sectors, all sizes, and all locations. These types of attacks are hard to detect and block since the attack traffic can be easily confused with legitimate traffic. In “Eliminating Single Points of Failure, Part 2,” Louis looks at the impact of DDoS attacks, type of attacks, and some of the mitigation strategies businesses can employ.\n [You might also like: DDoS Attackers Call for DDoS Defenders]\nSpeaking of Mitigation…\nAccording to Radware’s Carl Herberger, “attack mitigation is not a core competency of modern day security programs.” In “Hey there Security Professional….How do YOU mitigate attacks?” Carl looks at six key attributes that hacktivist groups look to exploit in their victims, and why companies need to evolve their security strategy at the speed of cyber security evolution.\nWhat Kinds of Attacks Are We Dealing With?\n“Ultra-adaptive hackers” have given rise to five particularly nasty attack techniques in 2017, including Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS), DNS Water Torture attacks, SSL-based attacks, and more.

These services make it possible for even novice hackers to purchase attack services and launch large-scale DDoS attacks at not much cost. In “The Growth of DDoS-as-a-Service: Stresser Services,” Radware’s ERT Researcher Daniel Smith breaks down the types of services available.\n [You might also like: The Evolution of the Dark Web]\nHappy Anniversary?\nOne of the most well-known DDoS attacks to happen in recent memory was the Dyn attack of 2016. One year ago, an attack was launched that disrupted service on many popular web sites. This attack was the work of the Mirai botnet, which enslaved hundreds of thousands of IoT devices that were then used to launch additional attacks. In “The Dyn Attack – One Year Later” Ron Winward analyzes the attack to see how a similar attack could occur in the future.\nConclusion\nThe motives for these attacks may differ in each case, but a robust security strategy is important to ensure that your company is protected from these threats. The threat landscape is constantly changing, and as we learned from the Dyn attack, you won’t always see an attack coming or know what it will look like. Knowledge is power – arm yourself with the resources to protect your business.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Everything You Need to Know About DDoS Attacks\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/everything-need-know-ddos-attacks/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Radware\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ddos-roundup.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1265,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-10-26\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-10-26\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DNS\', \'DoS\', \'Dyn\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/everything-need-know-ddos-attacks/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (81, 'Why the World is Under the Spell of IoT_Reaper', 'Pascal Geenens', '2017-10-25', 'It’s difficult to have missed the headlines on the new IoT botnet threat that is forming and the storm that might come with it. Why is the world under the spell of this new threat? What makes it different from Mirai? Why could it potentially become the most threatening botnet ever seen?\n\n\nA history lesson\nTo better understand and appreciate why IoT_Reaper is taking the world by storm, we should revisit the recent history of Mirai. A little over a year ago, Krebs and OVH faced devastating DDoS attacks of unseen sizes. Almost one week after the attacks, in a world that was still trying to understand exactly what happened, a bad actor going by the name of Anna-Senpai published the source code of a botnet named ‘Mirai’ on Hackforums.com, claiming responsibility for the attacks.\nMirai Milestones\nMirai became the first open-source botnet and most widely used weapon in the history of DDoS. Less than a month later, the internet infrastructure giant Dyn became a target of a Mirai botnet, resulting in large chunks of the internet becoming unreachable. Some of the internet’s largest cloud and service providers including Twitter, Spotify, Amazon, CNN and more were affected during the attacks. The Dyn attacks and their associated impact on many of the largest and most popular services on the internet marked a milestone in DDoS history. At that moment, most of us realized that the world would never be the same again and that Mirai and its victim, IoT, would severely impact the threat landscape for DDoS.\nThe water torture attack suffered by Dyn was not a new attack vector. First spotted in January 2014, water torture defeats the hierarchical caching of the internet DNS infrastructure. By generating random hostnames for a specific domain, the attacking device resolves the name through its recursive DNS. Because of the random nature of the hostname, the recursive DNS will always have a cache missing and has to forward the request to the authoritative DNS server for the domain. Now multiply this by hundreds of thousands of attackers, using tens of thousands of recursive DNS servers and the resulting load on the authoritative DNS. Take into account that authoritative DNS is sized with distributed caching in mind, knowing that locality of requests will be handled by the caches of the recursive DNS servers used by clients on the same internet segments. No authoritative DNS system, not matter how large it might be, is sized to be able to handle the load of hundreds of thousands of clients without the support of the distributed cache.\nWater Torture Attack\nAfter the attack on Dyn it was clear that the DDoS threat landscape was moving from large volume, low complexity, amplification-based attacks on one side of the threat spectrum and complex application level attacks at low volumes to a new combined threat of high volume, highly complex, application-level attacks. The water torture was one of the first in what we expect to be a long list of high volume application-level attacks we will face in the near future. Given the sizes of IoT botnets, it is fairly easy to imagine a simple-to-code application-level request can result in devastating volumetric attacks that are hard to detect and difficult to mitigate. Even if IoT devices are resource-constrained, they run common and well known operating systems based on Linux which ship with a rich library of functions enabling them to easily code DNS attacks (gethostbyname) or HTTP/FTP/IMAP/LDAP/POP/SMTP/… application level attacks (libcurl) including each of their SSL/TLS permutation (openssl).\n [You might also like: Chatting With IoT Bots]\nFollowing the public release of the full Mirai botnet code, hundreds of Mirai botnets got herded by wannabe and professional hackers, all enjoying the unsophisticated nature yet very lethal and efficient harvesting of unsecured, vulnerable IoT devices such as DVRs, IP cameras and NVRs. The low investment and easy access to a weapon of DDoS had its impact on the economy of this attack: for less than the average price of a latte, anyone can now launch a multi-gigabit DDoS attack lasting more than a couple of minutes.\nIt’s only a couple of months later that Mirai showed its true potential when wielded by a skilled attacker. On November 27th, Deutsche Telekom (DT) saw 900,000 of its consumers’ internet connections impacted as an unseen variant of Mirai was attempting to infect their modems. A hacker, apprehended earlier this year and going by the alias of “BestBuy,” modified the Mirai exploit code with the TR-069 NewNTPServer1 Remote Command Execution vulnerability. A simple HTTP POST-based attack, which was mostly unknown until then, impacted any ISP using the TR-069 CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP) to centrally manage its fleet of modems. Shortly after DT, TalkTalk and Post UK were affected by the same attacks. Luckily for the rest of the world, the modem infection attempts failed. I’m sure DT doesn’t think of themselves as being lucky, but they managed to remediate and mitigate the vulnerabilities in their modems within a couple of days and the world was back to normal. But imagine for one moment that the attack had succeeded: we would have faced a 900,000 device botnet – almost 10 times the size of the largest botnets we have faced the last year.\nTR-064 NewNTPServer RCE Exploit\nIoTroop or IoT_reaper?\nIn the last week, two independent security reports emerged covering what is thought to be the same botnet. On Oct 19th CheckPoint reported on a new botnet they discovered, dubbed ‘IoTroop.’ The first signs of the botnet were picked up by their Intrusion Prevention Systems, which were showing an increasing number of attempts by hackers to exploit a combination of vulnerabilities typically found in IoT devices.\nOn Oct 20th, Chinese security firm Netlab 360 published an extensive report on a new malicious sample they caught one month earlier which was targeting IoT devices. The bot borrowed code from the Mirai botnet but does not share the same brute force Telnet exploit vector. Instead it exploits nine known IoT vulnerabilities. They named their discovery ‘IoT_reaper.’\n [You might also like: Everything You Need to Know About Brickerbot, Hajime, and IoT Botnets]\nIoT_reaper is not open sourced, but it might as well be! Based on the fixed domain names and IPs provided in the Netlab 360 report, anyone has access to the latest malware binaries. From the exploit vectors discovered by Netlab, it is almost conclusive that CheckPoint and Netlab are referring to one and the same IoT botnet. Over the last week, reports on IoT_reaper aka IoTroop have emerged around the globe, sounding the alarm on a new IoT botnet storm in the making. Quoting the CheckPoint report on what could very well be the largest storm in IoT botnet history: “So far we estimate over a million organizations have already been affected worldwide, including the U.S., Australia and everywhere in between, and the number is only increasing.”\nAt this time IoT_Reaper (Reaper) is propagating but has not been observed launching attacks. The current versionof the malware (1.07) does not contain attack code and restricts itself to scanning and exploiting new potential victims.\nThis calls for some intimate time with Reaper – so I downloaded the latest sample and started examining the little bugger, to see if he really has what it takes to become the next largest IoT botnet.\nIt’s Mirai… noooo it’s Reaper!\nRunning the sample through virustotal.com, the link with Mirai is more than obvious. Out of the 20 engines that detected the malicious file, the vast majority reports it as being Mirai.\nBesides closely resembling architecture of IoT_Reaper, the bot itself does not expose a lot of Mirai characteristics. It might be based on the Mirai source, but it has undergone a serious transformation in terms of exploits, command and control, and omits all of the Mirai attack vectors. But it ships with an integrated Lua execution environment, which might prove more flexible and agile in terms of adding new attack vectors compared to hardcoding them.\nMirai Botnet Architecture\nReaper Botnet Architecture\n \n \n \n \n \nReaper uses the same distributed scanning and central loading architecture which made Mirai so effective in terms of harvesting bots. However, instead of doing aggressive, asynchronous SYN scans for open Telnet ports, Reaper performs a more elaborate, conservative TCP SYN scan on a series of different ports, one IP at a time. The SYN scan is always performed in the same sequence and the source IP and source port of the scan is the same for the lifetime of the bot. The sequence of destination port scans for each victim is:\n20480, 20736, 36895, 37151, 22528, 16671, 14340, 20992, 4135, 64288, 45090, 21248, 21504, 31775, 39455, 47115, 42254\nAfter the first wave of TCP SYN scans on the victim, a second wave of TCP SYN scans starts consisting of potential IoT web service ports:\n80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 88, 1080, 3000, 3749, 8001, 8060, 8080, 8081, 8090, 8443, 8880, 10000\nDuring the second wave the source port of the TCP SYN packet varies, while the source IP remains the IP of the infected device scanning for new victims.\nBased on the results of the last SYN port scan, the bot starts a series of nine HTTP-based exploits for each open port on the victim.\n [You might also like: The Expansion of IoT since Mirai.]\n9 known IoT vulnerabilities\nAs of version 1.06 and 1.07, Reaper contains exploits based on nine published IoT vulnerabilities.\n1: Exploiting an unauthenticated Remote Command Execution (REC) to dump the contents of /var/passwd based on DLink DIR-600 and DIR-300 vulnerabilities published Feb 4, 2013.\n\n2: Exploiting of CVE-2017-8225, a Pre-Authentication Info Leak containing clear text credentials within the custom GoAhead HTTP server included in several IP cameras. A vulnerability disclosed and published by Pierre Kim on March 8, 2017. The exploit as coded in Reaper dumps the system.ini of the IP cameras and is able to retrieve the admin credentials in doing so.\n\n3: Exploiting the Netgear ReadyNAS Surveillance unauthenticated Remote Command Execution vulnerability as reported by SecuriTeam Blogs on Sept 27, 2017. Remark that Netgear has released a patch to address the vulnerability.\n\nLooking closer at the exploit as executed by Reaper in the picture above, remark how the command to be executed is ‘echo nuuo 123456’. While the first two exploits were gathering information, the latter one is verifying the success of the potential remote code execution. If the RCE is successful, the findings of the successful exploit are communicated back to the central reporting server for further processing and infection by the loader service.\n4: Exploiting of Vacron NVR through Remote Command Execution as published by SecuriTeam Blogs on Oct 8, 2017. The unauthenticated RCE is used to dump /etc/passwd contents of the victim.\n\nAs per the report by Securiteam, Vacron did not answer repeated attempts to disclose the vulnerability, and at the time of writing there is no known solution or workaround to prevent Vacron devices from being exploited.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot only attacks compromised devices]\n5: Exploiting an unauthenticated RCE to list user accounts and their clear text passwords on D-Link 850L wireless routers. This vulnerability was published as part of multiple vulnerabilities on Aug 8, 2017.\n\nDLink has released patches to address these vulnerabilities through firmware 1.14B07 BETA.\n6: Exploiting a Linksys E1500/E2500 vulnerability caused by missing input validation, resulting in an injected shell command being executed. Vulnerability published Feb 5, 2013.\n\nThe URL-decoded POST payload ‘ping_ip=; AAA***BBB||| ;&ping_size=&ping_times=5&traceroute_ip=’ most probably tests the validity of the exploit. The vulnerability details that one must be authenticated for the exploit to work, so the validity of this exploit is not certain at this point.\n7: Exploiting of Netgear DGN DSL modems and routers using an unauthenticated Remote Command Execution dated back as far as May 31, 2013.\n\nThe exploit passes ‘echo dgn 123456’ as ‘cmd’ argument in the GET request and upon execution of the command validates the devices as vulnerable.\n8: Exploiting of AVTech IP cameras, DVRs and NVRs through an unauthenticated information leak and authentication bypass which gives access to all account information of the device. Vulnerability published on Oct 11, 2016.\n\nAVTech was contacted multiple times but without any response, this vulnerability is probably not fixed as of yet.\n9: Exploiting DVRs running a custom web server with the distinctive HTTP Server header ‘JAWS/1.0’. Pentest Partners published an unauthenticated remote command execution which Reaper tests by attempting to execute ‘echo jaws 123456; cat /proc/cpuinfo’. Upon validation, the exploit is passed on to the central report server for further exploiting and infection of the victim.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nCommand and Control\nDuring start-up the bot performs two DNS requests to resolve ‘weruuoqweiur.com’ and ‘e.hl852.com.’ The first domain resolves to 110.110.110.110 and it is not clear at this time what its use is. The second hostname resolves to IP address 27.102.101.121 and is the control server.\n [You might also like: BusyBox Botnet Mirai – the warning we’ve all been waiting for?]\nEvery 10 seconds the bot reports back to the control server through HTTP, providing mac address, type, and version of bot malware.\nC2 Protocol – red is bot to server, blue is response from the server\nChinese Roots?\nDigging for the domain name weruuoqweiur.com, the name was registered Oct 10th, 2017 through registrar HiChina Zhicheng Technology Ltd. by a registrant from Jangzhou, Zhejiang in China.\nDomain Name registration details\nWhen accessing the command and control server it greets with Chinese messages.\nAccessing the C2 Portal as hxxp://e.hl852.com\nDetecting Reaper – device IOCs\nThe executing malware consists of five active processes which are obfuscated by random names and for which the parent of the group hangs of off ‘init’ (pid 1).\n\nWhile the malware runs on the victim’s device, its first operation is removing the /var/log entry. Missing /var/log or missing history under /var/log after reboot are an indication of compromise by Reaper.\n\nThe malware also listens on port 23 (Telnet) for all interfaces, and all processes listen on port 48099 on localhost.\n\nDetecting Reaper – Network Inbound\nLook for a sequence of TCP SYN scans originating from the same source IP and source port to destination ports:\n20480, 20736, 36895, 37151, 22528, 16671, 14340, 20992, 4135, 64288, 45090, 21248, 21504, 31775, 39455, 47115, 42254\nDetecting Reaper – HTTP Exploits\nReaper uses only HTTP-based exploits and by consequence these are easily detectable by IPS or DPI.\nCheck for protocol HTTP on ports 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 88, 1080, 3000, 3749, 8001, 8060, 8080, 8081, 8090, 8443, 8880, 10000 and payloads as described in the exploits – see below:\n\nSo, is it an evolved Mirai?\nIf Reaper is based on Mirai’s source, which is very probable, it has received some very impacting changes but keeps the efficient distributed scan, central loader architecture which is characterizing for the Mirai botnet.\nCompared to Mirai, the SYN scanning in Reaper is much more elaborate but less aggressive.\n [You might also like: The offspring of two comic book giants bring us the Bot Squad! Super freaky!]\nReaper does not use Telnet brute force with default credentials but uses HTTP-based exploits of known vulnerabilities in IoT devices including Dlink, Netgear, Vacron, Linksys, AVTech, etc.Reaper does not include the TR069 NewNTPServer1 Remote Command Execution exploit used by the Mirai variant during the attacks on DT, TalkTalk and Post UK last November.\nCommand and Control uses unencrypted HTTP which checks in with the C2 server every 10 seconds; Mirai for its part uses a clear text, always-on TCP connection between the client and C2 server.\nIs Reaper sophisticated?\nThe most sophisticated IoT botnet known to date is Hajime, discovered two days before the Dyn attacks and clocking in on about 300,000 devices at its peak in April of 2017. Still today, over 30% of our IoT honeypot activity is attributed to Hajime.\nCompared to the unsophisticated, unencrypted HTTP protocol used by Reaper, Hajime uses multiple trackerless BitTorrent channels with daily changing infohashes, while encrypting all C2 traffic across the BitTorrent channels using public/private key RC4.\nHajime does not contain such an elaborate number of IoT exploits to infect IoT devices, but does leverage the default passwords dictionary of Mirai for Telnet bruting while it adds the Arris password of the day and TR069 NewNTPServer RCE exploits.\nHow serious is this threat? Is a storm imminent? Can we stop it?\nThe control servers, the architecture and the methods of operation of the Reaper botnet have been uncovered and are known. It is not as sophisticated compared to Hajime and it uses a fixed domain and IP addresses for its C2 servers, which should make blacklisting or blackholing effective to stop any attacks it might attempt.\nI’m not sure why the servers are still active at this moment, but they have been identified and are known.\nReaper uses very specific methods to find new victims and infect those victims. IPS signatures can easily be crafted to block the further discovery and spreading of new victim devices. The exploits are not very sophisticated, they are all HTTP-based and can be blocked with simple signatures at gateway level. The bot is mainly using security vulnerabilities that were uncovered in the last four years by security researchers, while limiting itself to use exploits to gather information. Only once exploits are validated will a central loader server leverage these to install the malware. Blacklisting and blackholing of the loader server is certainly a potential solution to stop the infection and spreading of the botnet.\nThe communication from infected devices to their central server is done in clear text HTTP with a fixed pattern. The clients check in every 10 seconds with the server and most probably this channel will be used to deliver commands and attack scripts if or when the malware gets armed and activated by its authors. The server domains, IP addresses and the HTTP requests are easily identified and blocked at gateway level.\nThe threat does exist from the hundreds of thousands of devices that are not protected in any way by a firewall or gateway. There is unfortunately not much that can be done to protect those devices and prevent them from joining the army of Reaper-bots. That said, blackholing the servers at ISP level will render those devices useless zombies until rebooted and cleaned from any infection.\n [You might also like: IoT Threats: Whose problem is it?]\nWe can also trust in our allies, good and bad, such as Hajime and BrickerBot to try to keep the upper hand in the war on IoT devices. I do not agree with the ways of the Janit0r or BrickerBot, but if devices are left unsecured, uncontrolled and unprotected by any form of firewall or gateway, I prefer them disabled rather than becoming a weapon that could destabilize online businesses or the cloud economy.\nConcluding remarks\nThere is nothing new in the threat that is forming that we did not face at the end of 2016 and over the course of 2017. The IoT botnets have impacted the economy of the DDoS attacks and brought them within reach of anyone, technically and price-wise. DDoS campaigns by disgruntled users or customers, competitors, ransom DDoS campaigns, hacktivist campaigns…they have become a part of the consistent threat we all have to live with. A more pressing issue caused by IoT botnets is the complexity of the attacks, which caused a shift in the threat landscape forcing us to find new, better and faster ways to detect and protect customers.\nThe biggest threat everyone should be scared about is that of the possibility for fragmented IoT botnets to get overrun by one strong and efficient botnet which can win the battle for IoT devices on every occasion, and will create a super-botnet of unequal and unseen size. Iot_Reaper has been thought of as a potential candidate, but all indicators lead one to believe that this will not be the case. At least not if it does not evolve and the authors of Reaper shift gears to provide more sophisticated malware and command & control infrastructure. I’m certainly not ruling out that there is a real and imminent threat – the one who creates a malware that spreads faster and more efficiently across IoT devices will hold the world of the internet in its power and will be able to cause a lot of damage and downtime. Combining multiple exploits of known and unknown vulnerabilities will certainly pay off, and this is the strategy IoT_Reaper chose to adopt, albeit not fully implemented and ready for primetime before it was uncovered.\nWe need to stay vigilant and detect threats in their early development stage, like was the case with IoT_Reaper. Kudos to Netlab 360 and CheckPoint for pointing all of our cyber noses in the right direction. Together, as a community, we can fend off the threats that might emerge from it.\nWe have been living with Hajime for a year now. This botnet is assumingly 300,000 devices large and could be used for devastating attacks, but for now it has been helping IoT by protecting them from further abuse. Sometimes unconventional solutions are needed to solve unconventional problems for which we cannot provide immediate conventional solutions.\nTo read the alert from our ERT Team, click here: Reaper Botnet\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/iot_reaper-botnet/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (82, 'DDoS Attackers Call for DDoS Defenders', 'Ben Zilberman', '2017-10-24', 'In late July we were approached by a government agency of a Latin American country who was suffering from an over-a-month long campaign of DDoS attacks they had so far failed to mitigate. Each of the attacks lasted for several hours at a time –sometimes multiple times a day – making it through their existing DDoS protection device and right into the headlines of the local press.\n\n\nThe attacks came in different waves, targeting the communication channels for individuals as well as the agency branches, preventing electronic and virtual transactions and resulting in an unknown extent of reputational and financial losses.\n\nRadware’s ERT DDoS warriors have been fighting these waves of attacks ever since onboarding this agency to our Emergency Mitigation Service. The first action was to divert the traffic to our scrubbing center for cleaning so the packets that arrive at the organization’s network are only legitimate requests, thus protecting their user experience. For a short time after the diversion was made, we saw multi-vector attacks at rates of 1Gbps-4Gbps that we successfully mitigated.\n [You might also like: Radware’s ERT Mitigated a Spoofed-IPs Attack of Several Hundred Gbps]\nHowever, at a certain point there has been a significant escalation in the campaign patterns. The attackers probably figured these volumes are not capable of causing an outage and started ramping up the assaults with a combination of 36Gbps-88Gbps fragmented and reflection attacks. While these volumes are not the highest the world has seen, they are still on the very high end for a single reflective hit and could easily saturate any network pipe and knock down any firewall or DNS server.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nBehavioral Analysis for Surgical Mitigation\nThese attacks are comprised of multiple vectors including SYN floods, UDP floods, ICMP floods with high rate UDP fragmented and DNS/NTP reflection attacks. DNS reflection was the primary attack vector that turned highly effective when the attacks began. Each wave was comprised of a quite similar vector blend, leading us to believe these are the same attackers using probably the same tools – a signal for determination and persistency. Due to the high volumes – while the customer internet link was of a relatively low capacity – it required a surgical intervention of our experts to protect the DNS server and also make sure the legitimate traffic is recognized and let through. This could not have been achieved without a behavioral analysis of the regular users’ traffic patterns on one hand and monitoring the changes in the attack traffic as it progressed.\n\nSecurity experts from Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) performed a thorough investigation, worked in real-time with the customer to challenge the attacking IPs and identify each of the additional vectors, and manually configured supplemental protections, which significantly improved our ability to mitigate the attack.

Behavioral analysis of the traffic done by auto-learning algorithms creates and updates baselines as well as signatures thus combining positive and negative security models for the highest rate of detection and best SLA protection.\nAutomation – plays a great role in adaptively identifying traffic patterns and anomalies and initiate DDoS mitigation and diversion when needed as well as developing new signature in real time.\nAn expert team – as DDoS attacks are becoming more complex, and attackers do not simply use multiple vectors but monitor the attack closely and make necessary adjustments during a campaign, the challenge to unexperienced organizations with limited task force and expertise is greater.\n\nSimply put: DDoS attackers call for DDoS defenders.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"DDoS Attackers Call for DDoS Defenders\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/ddos-attackers-call-ddos-defenders/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Ben Zilberman\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/case-study-ert.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1280,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-10-24\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-10-24\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'Denial of Service\', \'DNS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/ddos-attackers-call-ddos-defenders/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (83, 'The Dyn Attack – One Year Later', 'Ron Winward', '2017-10-19', 'One year ago, a threat actor launched a DDoS attack that disrupted service of some of the internet’s biggest names. The Mirai botnet had enslaved hundreds of thousands of IoT devices and was used to attack several entities, including the managed Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn.\nThe attack on Dyn was an event that many referred to as a wake-up call for internet security.\nExcept the industry, by and large, never really woke up.\n\nThink of DNS servers as the contact list on your mobile phone. If you couldn’t access that list, how many phone numbers would you actually remember? By attacking the DNS infrastructure, internet users were no longer able to connect to many of the websites and services they use every day. The attack disrupted the connection made between domain names and the IP addresses that they belong to, essentially breaking a critical connection in how we access information and content on the internet.\nThe Dyn attack exposed a vulnerability that is not new, but few businesses had done anything to prevent. One year later, my new analysis demonstrates how a similar attack could occur.\n\nOne Year Later\nOne of the ways for website operators to protect themselves from this type of attack is to use more than one provider for DNS, providing a failover option for when a portion of the DNS system can’t do its job.\nAfter the Dyn attack, you would expect that more companies would adopt the model of diverse DNS providers. One provider could be the primary, another could be secondary, and even more could be added for redundancy.\nI was curious about how many companies had actually adopted this model. Using Alexa’s rankings of web traffic and page rankings, I pulled a list of the top 100 U.S. websites.  I fed this list into a small script that I wrote to give me all of the authoritative name servers for each domain in the list. The query is effectively the following in Linux:\n$ dig @[recursive DNS server] +short NS example.com\nFrom here I could analyze the data on domains and their respective authoritative name servers. What I found was that 68 of the top 100 U.S. websites (or more than two thirds by Alexa’s rankings) still use only one DNS provider for their domain. In fact, several of the major companies directly affected by the Dyn attack still only use one provider.\n\nHowever, perhaps this isn’t as simple as it seems, so I wanted to dig in further.\n [You might also like: How Friday’s Massive DDoS Attack on the U.S. Happened]\nFirst, I noticed that some of the websites that were affected by the original attack are still single homed behind a single (albeit new) provider, like Amazon’s managed DNS service:\n$ dig @8.8.8.8 +short NS [redacted].com\r\n\r\n[redacted].awsdns-43.org.\r\n\r\n[redacted].awsdns-56.co.uk.\r\n\r\n[redacted].awsdns-18.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].awsdns-10.com.\r\n\r\n$\nOne can’t help but wonder why a company that was affected by single-homed DNS would move to another, single DNS provider. Well, in the case above, Amazon has a tremendous amount of bandwidth globally, and because most of their traffic is outbound, they have the bandwidth to support inbound attacks. There are other benefits too, but it shouldn’t take long before you realize that a single provider is still a single provider and thus a single point of failure. API attacks and human error resulting in cascading automated failures are concerns in large scale, highly automated networks.\nAlso, as you can see in the example above, many DNS companies spread their services across different Top Level Domains (TLDs), which protects against problems or attacks against a particular TLD. Examples of TLDs include “.com” “.net” and “.org”.\nAnd in the case of Amazon themselves? Well, they do use diverse providers and none of them are their own DNS service:\n$ dig @8.8.8.8 +short NS amazon.com\r\n\r\n[redacted].ultradns.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].dynect.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].dynect.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].dynect.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].dynect.net.\r\n\r\n[redacted].ultradns.co.uk.\r\n\r\n$\nClearly those responsible for the domain Amazon.com see the value in redundant DNS providers.\nWho else was affected?\nOf course Dyn and their customers were affected. But there was other collateral damage in the ISP networks too. The anatomy of this DNS attack is as follows:\n– A real device on the network makes a request for a random subdomain or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). For example, abc123xyz.example.com, asdf9876.example.com.\n– These hostnames are unique and thus not cached on the local recursive DNS resolver, so it must pass its request upstream to the authoritative name server. This task can be resource intensive on the recursive server when done in large waves like this, so local DNS services are also impacted for local networks (including ISPs).\n– The authoritative name server receives lookup requests for countless non-existent FQDNs from legitimate DNS resolvers around the world. Not only are they bombarded by high packet per second lookup requests, but they must process each one.\nIt’s important to note that individual ISPs reported impact on their own infrastructure caused by just the lookups of devices within their footprint. This highlights the need to also protect your recursive servers if you run them.\n [You might also like: Everything You Need to Know About Brickerbot, Hajime, and IoT Botnets]\nCould it happen again?\nThe short answer is: yes! Will it happen exactly the same way? Probably not.\nWhen the source code for Mirai was released by threat actor Anna-senpai, the threat landscape changed even further. Suddenly, everyone had the capability to build and deploy their own Mirai botnet. Not only did they have the code, but they had instructions on how to do it. People even offer a service to set it up.\nAnna-senpai had released the first open source IoT botnet.\nAlthough the quantity of connected IoT devices continues to grow and the number of Mirai botnets continues to grow, those armies are now splintered. What was once a single botnet of 380,000 devices is now many botnets with much smaller bot counts. We also have fighting among the botnets, including Mirai, Hajime, and BrickerBot.\nYou might say that Anna-senpai had the right recipe at the right time.\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\nWhat’s interesting about Mirai is that it’s incredibly versatile and customizable. Technically, the bots don’t have to be IoT devices. There was a Windows variant reported in the wild and if you’re like me, maybe you run the bot in your lab on top of Linux.\nYou can see how this can become a much different problem. Surely there are active Mirai bots that are actually powerful servers with big uplinks, rather than tiny, low powered devices sprinkled around a home network.\nHow will it happen?\nThe attack on Dyn was reportedly an attack on one of their customers. But what if attackers targeted the entire global DNS infrastructure? Could a large scale version of this attack happen again, targeting the top DNS providers? Yes, it could.\n [You might also like: Let’s discuss facts: An insight into Mirai’s source-code]\nHow it will happen is open for debate. One of the strengths of Mirai is that attack traffic originates from real hosts. Another strength is that it’s customizable and attackers can add their own attack vectors to the code.\nGartner estimates that there were about 6.4 billion IoT devices on the internet in 2016 and that there will be around 20.4 billion in the year 2020. Some estimates that I’ve seen are as high as 50 billion for 2020. We’ll see when we get there, but it’s clear that we’re on a trajectory of adding a tremendous quantity of devices to the network. A portion of these devices will absolutely be capable of being exploited and used in attacks.\nEven if they aren’t directly herded into botnets, these devices pose the risk of traditional attack vectors too, like reflection attacks. Simply put, many of the people developing these devices are not thinking about security. They’re thinking of how to build a nice User Interface (UI) and functionality onto a compute device with a small amount of resources (storage, CPU, memory, etc.).\nAPI Attacks\nAnother way we could see this scale of attack is with threat actors targeting Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs are an open interface for external connectivity to request a function inside of a third-party network. Maybe it’s an attack on the provider’s API, or maybe it’s an attack that leverages an exposed API to then launch an external attack.\nWhat is the best solution?\nIn the past year, I’ve been surprised to meet security professionals who have never heard of the Mirai botnet, or the attack on Dyn and how it impacted the internet. I don’t think it’s necessarily bad to have only one DNS provider. I do think that website operators must continue to think about the impact of availability in every aspect of their online presence, including DNS.\nWe learned a few lessons last year. First, don’t forget about the threats and vulnerabilities that are in plain sight. Of course redundant DNS providers can benefit people. There’s a reason the protocol allows for multiple DNS servers in a zone. But many people haven’t given diversity in DNS providers much thought until recently.\nSecond, attacks can come from where you least expect them. How many of us thought one day we’d be talking about an IP camera botnet army that broke the internet? It all makes sense, but did we see it coming, exactly the way it unfolded? No.\nAs we see in the research above, some companies who were directly affected by the Dyn attack made the decision to stay with a single provider. They made other changes and I can understand why. They determined that was the best solution for their network. Other companies chose to add diversity in their providers to increase their resiliency.\n [You might also like: The Expansion of IoT since Mirai.]\nNevertheless, only 32% of the top 100 U.S. websites have diverse DNS providers and that’s still a risk for the other 68%. Even if the DNS provider’s network is robust and includes DDoS protection, a single provider is just that, a single provider, and this carries some risk.\nLooking Forward\nAs a connected ecosystem, traditional security simply isn’t keeping pace with today’s automated operational infrastructures. In civil engineering, we had years to develop codes and safety regulations. We had catastrophic failures, but we had time to rebuild and learn from design weaknesses. This is not the case in today’s connected world. It’s a race to do more, build more, and expose more. Our rate of connectivity, change and advancement is unprecedented. It’s also our greatest vulnerability as a whole.\nContinue thinking about how you will protect your own online infrastructure and remember that a year ago, much of the internet was caught by surprise with this attack. You won’t always see it coming and you usually won’t know what the attack will look like until it happens. Choose a protection set that uses behavioral technologies to identify anomalous traffic and can take action to protect your infrastructure. Your business might depend on it.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DNS\', \'Dyn\', \'Hacking\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/dyn-attack-one-year-later/');

They positioned load balancers in front of the application to support the growing traffic load. Traffic to the website was growing so fast, that parts of the network infrastructure could not support the customer load.\n\n\nOne of the first components to fail under the load was the traditional network firewall at the edge of the network. It used standard access control policies based on source and destination layer 3 (IP) and layer 4 (TCP/UDP) information. Upon review and consultation with the customer, we determined that the reverse-proxy function of the load balancer performed the function of the firewall, making it redundant. Ultimately, the customer removed the firewall and network bottleneck, comfortably relying on the load balancer to protect their application from network threats.\nOnce and future security solution\nThe application delivery controller (ADC) has always been a security device.

Practices such as the following need to be thoroughly reviewed:\n\nPoor logging practices – Many web application logs contain sensitive information such as passwords, session IDs, and other codes. A strong logging design is key to a secure web application.\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaws – The web application can be used as a mechanism to transport an attack to an end userâs browser. A successful attack can disclose the end userâs session token, attack the local machine, or spoof content to fool the user.\nBuffer overflows – Web application components in some languages that do not properly validate input can be crashed and, in some cases, used to take control of a process. These components can include CGI, libraries, drivers, and web application server components.\nCommand Injection flaws – Web applications pass parameters when they access external systems or the local operating system. If an attacker can embed malicious commands in these parameters, the external system may execute those commands on behalf of the web application.\nBroken thread safety – Web applications are highly concurrent, and thread safety problems can result in significant security issues. Concurrent programming is one of the most difficult aspects of developing secure web applications.\nWeb and application server misconfiguration- Having a strong server configuration standard is critical to a secure web application. These servers have many configuration options that affect security and are not secure out of the box.\nRemote administration flaws – Many web applications allow administrators to access the site using a web interface. If these administrative functions are not carefully protected, an attacker can gain full access to all aspects of a site.\n\nAuditors Must Change to Adapt to the New Landscape!\nSo, as you can tell, availability-based risks are a big problem and need a serious set of auditing and control procedures to both measure, monitor and protect!\nTo reiterate, any assessment of an organizationâs availability risks would be remiss if they focused only on DDoS threats.

Many forms of attacks on your network are known and more easily defeated, but the most daunting attacks are those whose form is not known, not yet seen or perhaps not yet recognized. There are also the attacks that are known, but the modes in which the attacks are leveraged are not known. That is why perimeters are successfully being compromised. In the case of most of the recent attacks, the customary way of deploying security technology is not able to defend against these new attackers.  \n [You might also like: 2017âs 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 2)]\nSo – – What is the new model?  \nTo be effective, a DDoS protection solution must first be able to identify the attack as it is forming or in process of attacking the network. Second, it must determine which incoming traffic has a malicious intent and which is traffic is legitimate. The legitimate traffic must be allowed to pass so that commerce can still be conducted and the illegitimate traffic must be quarantined from the rest of the network and dispensed.  In addition, a network defense system must cope with various and multiple attacks in real time.    \nStandard network-security solutions depend on static signature protection against known application-vulnerability exploits and rate-based protection against high-volume attacks and unknown attacks.  Static signature-protection technology, deployed by Network-IPS, firewalls, and anti-viruses, can only identify predefined attacks. This type of traditional perimeter security relies on periodic signature updates, leaving the business vulnerable to zero-minute attacks, and offers no solution against non-vulnerabilityâbased attacks.  Rate-based DDoS mitigationtechnology is designed to suppress abnormal traffic patterns. This technology is deployed as means of mitigating high-volume attacks or zero-minute attacks. However, a rate-based solution does not differentiate between attack traffic and legitimate traffic. Packets and sessions, good and bad, above predefined thresholds are dropped. Rate-based technology offers no protection against lower-rate attacks (for example, brute-force attacks, low rate malware propagation, slow network and application probes).  Furthermore, rate-based technology cannot prevent improper-use scenarios where attack traffic such as an HTTP page flood appears identical to legitimate application requests as in a flash crowd.\nComing Soon:  Part II:  The Rise of the âAvailability Vulnerabilitiesâ\nIn my next post I will address the specific vulnerabilities required to be tested in order to develop some reasonableness to the efficacy of an internal control infrastructure.\n\n\nRead “Top 9 DDoS Threats Your Organization Must Be Prepared For” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Pandoraâs Box: Auditing for DDoS Vulnerabilities, Part I\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/auditing-ddos-vulnerabilities/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Carl Herberger\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/pandoras-box-ddos-vulnerabilities.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1281,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-10-12\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-10-12\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Auditing\', \'availability\', \'ddos\', \'hacktivists\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/auditing-ddos-vulnerabilities/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (87, 'Why Traditional High Availability (HA) for Security Devices is Not Enough', 'Daniel Lakier', '2017-10-11', 'It’s funny although sometimes the first way we do something might be the right way, we try to improve it to make it look shinier. Eventually we realize that the most obvious answer was actually the right answer, our original tactic.\n\n\nFor those of you reading this who were in the firewall business in the mid-90s, you should remember a time when firewall vendors used an external device to provide high availability (HA) functionality. In the case of Checkpoint for example, the relationship with Stonesoft was exemplary; They sold as a team and were very successful together. Their joint solution offered best-in-class, fast, efficient, easy-to-manage firewalling, and a great HA experience. For that brief point in time, security devices’ HA design and functionality was 15 years ahead of its networking counterparts. Firewalls could be set up in an active/active configuration, N+X redundancy was possible (if not needed at the time) and horizontal scaling was a distinct option.\nThen events conspired to change the way the world designed HA security, and not for the better. What happened, you ask? Stonesoft decided to make a monumental business blunder and make a firewall. Whenyou make most of your sales through a strategic partner who happens to make firewalls for future reference, you should probably not make a firewall. This blunder resulted in Checkpoint quickly moving away from the load balanced HA model, embracing an emerging protocol called VRRP, severing their partnership with Stonesoft, and the rest as they say is history. Given Checkpoint’s dominance in the firewall space and marketing strength, the load balanced firewall design all but disappeared over the next 20 years. Today more than ever security device load balancing should be back to the forefront of our minds when we think HA. Because today, high availability designs need to offer more than just uptime, they also have to offer piece of mind, stability and predictable use under all environments.\n [You might also like: The World is Changing]\nSo I’ll list out the advantages of the load balanced design then go into more details. Active configuration (high end firewalls can cluster, but there is a difference), lateral scale (price and throughput), N+X redundancy, gateway translation functionality and intelligent traffic steering.\nToday most security device manufacturers (firewalls, IPS, anti-malware etc.) recommended HA designs based upon the active-passive model. In most cases, these vendors have an active option but seldom recommend its use because of the likely problem with asynchronous routes (user sessions coming in through one firewall and leaving through the other, creating a visibility problem). On the higher end, a few vendors can offer HA through clustering up to three devices together. This does get around the asynchronous routes problem, but does it answer large enterprise, ecommerce or other commercial customer availability concerns? What I mean is, if a company that decides they need four active clustered core switches with active data centers, is N+2 redundancy for a in-line single point of failure device enough? Let’s also illustrate the limitations with either model offered by the security device manufactures with a theoretical example.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nLet’s say a new security bug comes out tomorrow, a really bad one. All the security vendors scramble to make a fix. Two days from now, they release a new version of beta code (no testing in the field) with the new feature to counteract this big threat. Management comes to you and says, “we need this fix, we are at risk” today, how comfortable are you upgrading your firewalls to test the stability of this code in production? The answer is, you’re not. Why? Because the way HA works in the security device world is that all devices need to run the same code. I can’t run the new code on one device and just failover if it doesn’t work, because the HA configuration requires both devices to be running the same code. There are exceptions (Forcepoint and Fortinet can run multiple version of code in a clustered or HA configuration) but the only the lowest common feature set will be active, so the problem still persists. Without upgrading all units, I can’t roll out new code in production for testing without introducing an unacceptable risk.\nThe load-balanced architecture solves this problem. You can run as many versions of code on as many active firewalls as you like, and if there is a bug, you can just use traffic steering to move the traffic while you fix the code version. To take it one step further, you could run multiple vendors’ devices in parallel while offering an HA architecture. A common grumble I hear today is, “we would like to change manufacturers but the cutover would be too difficult as we have to many rules, etc.” Well, with the load balanced architecture it can become a migration over time as opposed to a single point in time cutover.\nNow let’s address lateral scale today in the security device world. When I need to upgrade throughput, for example, if I get larger internet pipes and go from requiring 10 gig of firewall throughput to requiring 20 gig, I throw out the 10 gig firewalls and buy 20 gig firewalls. Why, you ask? Because native HA has to be set up with two similar devices. However, if you were using the load balanced architecture, you could just scale by adding another 10 gig firewall in an active configuration. You would have the correct throughput and more redundancy because you would have an extra unit. Also, should the need arise, you could run disparate units, i.e.: 1x 10 gig and 1 x 20 gig. This isn’t only a more economical solution but it once again offers better redundancy.\n [You might also like: SCADA: Changing the Dynamic]\nSSL inspection is one of the leading drivers for this architectural change today, and in many cases ADCs are being bought solely for this function, in my opinion because the ADC vendors aren’t explaining the value of the other ADC features set.\nRoughly 50% of all internet traffic today is SSL-encrypted, yet most security device manufactures can only deliver a fraction of their inspection on SSL encrypted traffic. For example, Palo Alto offers only 2 gig aggregate SSL inspection on their 30 gig 5060 firewall. On their newer 5060, they offer roughly 5 gig aggregate which seems impressive, but that is a 73 gig platform. Radware’s smallest ADC can offer more than 9 gig at a fraction of the cost. The ADC SSL inspection architecture not only lends itself to being able to size smaller security devices, thus saving significant Capex, it also reduces latency. If each security device needs to do the SSL negotiation for inspection purposes, that adds a lot of latency (typical environment, Firewall, IPS anti-malate on the way in and firewall, IPS and DLP on the way out. Six SSL negotiations as opposed to two, one in and one out, using the ADC architecture).\nAdditional Gateway functionality can also be useful, such as having the load balancer/ADC act as a reverse HTTP2 gateway. In the event that older security devices cannot understand HTTP2, the load balancer is in the right place to downgrade the HTTP2 to HTTP1, pass it through the security device, than re-encapsulate it into HTTP2 before sending it on its way. HTTP2 is just one example, but I think you will see this benefit being used more often in the future.\nAll these functions put together are the reasons load balanced architecture made sense before and why we should remember it makes sense still. Sometimes the most obvious solution is the best solution.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Firewall\', \'high availability\', \'load balancing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/10/traditional-high-availability-security-devices/');

This part takes a broader look at CDNs in general, and how bringing back your security from the ‘edge’ can improve the overall security of your web applications.\n\nAs we explained in the first part of this series, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been around for a long time, and have developed into an effective way for delivering web content.  Content is stored on Points-of-Presence (PoPs) distributed globally at the ‘edge’ of the network, and when end-users request cached content, that content is served directly from the PoP nearest to them.\n\nAs CDNs gained popularity, CDN providers also began integrating security mechanisms into their networks, giving rise to the concept of ‘edge security’: when a new request arrives at the ‘edge’ PoP, it is also inspected against known security threats. If such threats are found, traffic is blocked; if not, it is allowed through.\nThis approach makes a lot of sense for CDN vendors, as it makes use of their existing infrastructure and – as the cost of CDN service constantly declines – is a cost-effective way of offering value-added services.\nFrom a web application point-of-view, however, there are a number of critical challenges that arise from this approach.\n [You might also like: Protecting the Multi-CDN Part I: The Security Challenge of Multi-CDN]\nIf all you have is a hammer, every problem is a nail\nThere’s an old adage, that if all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. This is also true for CDN-based security. Since CDNs are all about web content delivery – to apply the metaphor – everything to them is an HTTP request. Their focus is on traffic itself, and relatively little thought is given to the underlying application. This creates a number of difficulties when it comes to web application security:\n\nNo application context: CDNs focus mostly on HTTP/S web traffic, and have little or no awareness of the underlying web application, its structure, or vulnerabilities. As a result, CDN security policies tend to follow standardized templates that cannot adapt automatically per application-specific needs, or require heavy manual customization.\nInbound traffic only: Since the role of CDNs is to accelerate website content, by definition they inspect inbound traffic to the website only. They do not have any capabilities to inspect (and protect) outbound network traffic, nor provide any data leakage prevention (DLP) functionality.\nOnly on the cloud: CDNs are cloud-only services. As a result, by definition, they cannot provide premise-based or hybrid security solutions – or interface with existing premise-based security solutions – even when such solutions are required.\n\nNegative by design\nIn addition to lacking application context, most CDNs adhere to a ‘negative’ security approach: that is, they allow everything through except what is explicitly blocked. That as opposed to a ‘positive’ security approach, which takes into context the nature of the legitimate traffic, and then blocks everything which is not legitimate. However, because of how they are designed, most CDNs are structurally unable to apply a positive security model:\n\nPredefined, static policies: ‘Positive’ security requires automatic self-learning, which involves looking at all traffic. However, since each CDN ‘edge’ PoP sees only a small sliver of total security, it cannot deduce what it means for traffic as a whole, and for all PoPs to communicate with each other would create far too much traffic overhead for the network to handle. Therefore, CDNs cannot apply real-time learning and must rely on predefined, static signatures-based security policies.\nZero-day vulnerability: Since CDNs rely on a ‘negative’ security model with signature-based policies, by default they allow through all traffic except what is explicitly forbidden. Therefore, they cannot – by definition – deal with emergent, zero-day threats they had not seen before. They must wait for signatures to be manually configured by the vendor, and then be manually enabled by each individual customer.\nLong propagation time: Since CDN security filtering is done at the ‘edge’, security policies must be configured centrally and then propagated to each individual ‘edge’ PoP. As CDNs grow in size and volume of traffic, so does the amount of time that it takes information to filter down. In fact, it is not uncommon for CDNs to take up to several hours to propagate security updates across the entire network. When you are under attack, this time matters.\n\n [You might also like: Protecting the Multi-CDN Part II: Approaches for Securing the Multi-CDN]\nBuilt-in vulnerabilities\nIn addition to structural limitation in security approach, most CDNs also share a number of built-in security vulnerabilities as a result of their basic design:\n\nDynamic content attacks: CDNs are built to cache static content and redirect dynamic content back to the origin server. Hackers know this, and therefore design denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that generate massive amounts of dynamic HTTP GET requests. Such attacks cannot be handled by ‘edge’ security mechanisms, and CDNs must resort to brute-force rate-limiting procedures which limit legitimate traffic to the website and result in high degrees of false positives.\nForwarding loop attacks: Forwarding loop attacks are a mechanism in which malicious users manipulate the internal request forwarding mechanism of CDNs to cause the network to process requests repetitively, thereby effecting a denial-of-service (DoS) attack against the network. An independent study by computer scientists from the University of California, Berkley and Tsinghua University found that of 16 leading CDNs tested, every single CDN was vulnerable to some form of forwarding loop attacks. In particular, Dam Flooding attacks (which accumulate a large number of requests over time and then trigger them all at once) and Inter-CDN Loops (which create forwarding loops across multiple CDNs) proved to be particularly difficult to defend against.\nSSL-based attacks: As more internet traffic becomes encrypted, SSL floods are becoming a key attack vector because they demand large amounts of computing resources from target servers. CDNs, however, are poorly equipped to handle SSL-based attacks because they require customers share their SSL certificates (thereby reducing privacy) and decrypt each SSL packets individually on the cloud (thereby creating large amounts of latency), or else cannot protect customers from such attacks at all.\n\nStepping back from the edge\nAs we can see, CDN-based ‘edge’ security has a number of significant downsides, which leads to greater security exposure and more operational overhead. Many of these drawbacks stem from the ‘negative’ security model mandated by CDN design.\nTo overcome these shortcomings, customers should consider taking a step back from the proverbial edge and adopt security mechanisms based on ‘positive’ security, and which do not rely on CDN infrastructure to protect their web applications.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite.”\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'CDN\', \'content delivery network\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/10/securing-cdn-thinking-outside-the-edge/');

Standard packages normally cost $20 a month and allow the user to launch one attack at a time for a 20-minute period. These tools also utilize a number of attack vectors like DNS, SNMP, NTP, HTTP, TCP and UDP floods.\n [You might also like: The Evolution of the Dark Web]\n• DNS – A DNS amplification attack is a sophisticated denial-of-service attack where the attacker performs two malicious tasks. First, the attacker spoofs the IP address of the DNS resolver and replaces it with the victim’s IP address, so all DNS replies will be sent to the victim’s servers. Second, the attacker finds an Internet domain that is registered with many DNS records. During the DoS attack, the attacker sends DNS queries that request the entire list of DNS records for that domain. This results in replies from the DNS servers, usually so big that they need to be split over several packets.\n• SNMP – A SNMP amplification attack is a sophisticated denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP), an everyday protocol found in a number of devices including routers, printers and switches, in order to amplify an attack. Like other reflective attacks, the attacker spoofs the IP address of the SNMP query and sends the malformed packets to a number of devices, resulting in a very large response being sent to the victim’s device.\n• NTP Monlist Flood – The NTP Amplification attack is an emerging form of DDoS attacks that relies on the use of publically accessible NTP servers to overwhelm a victim’s system with UDP traffic. The NTP service supports a monitoring service that allows administrators to query the server for traffic counts of connected clients. This information is provided via the ‘monlist’ command. The basic DDoS attack technique consists of an attacker sending a “get monlist” request to a vulnerable NTP server, with the source address spoofed to be the victim’s address.\n• HTTP Flood – A method used by hackers to attack web servers and applications. It consists of seemingly legitimate session-based sets of HTTP GET or POST requests that are designed to consume a significant amount of a server’s resources, and can result in a denial-of-service condition – without necessarily requiring a high rate of network traffic.\n [You might also like: Malware and Botnet Attack Services Found on the Darknet]\n• SSYN – A SSYN attack is a spoofed SYN attack. In a SYN attack, the attacker floods their victim’s computer with a large amount of SYN packets. This DDoS attack is intended to exhaust the victim’s device. Once all of the connections are filled, the server will not be able to respond to legitimate users, thus causing a denial of service. In a spoofed SYN attack the attacker runs a similar script that spoofs the attacking IP addresses to prevent the attacker from being traced.\n• TCP Flood – This is one of the oldest types of DDoS attacks. It involves sending numerous SYN packets to the victim. In many cases, attackers will spoof the SRC IP so the reply (SYN+ACK packet) will not return, thus overwhelming the session/connection tables of the targeted server or one of the network entities on the way (typically the firewall). Servers need to open a state for each SYN packet that arrives and store this state in tables that have limited size. As big as this table may be, it is easy to send a sufficient amount of SYN packets that will fill the table, and once this happens the server starts to drop a new request, including legitimate ones. Similar effects can happen on a firewall which also has to process and invest in each SYN packet. Unlike other TCP or application-level DDoS attacks, the attacker does not have to use a real IP – this is perhaps the biggest strength of the DDoS attack.\n• UDP Flood – In a UDP flood, the attacker sends large UDP packets to a single destination or to random ports. Since the UDP protocol is “connectionless” and does not have any type of handshake mechanism, the main intention of a UDP flood is to saturate the Internet pipe. Usually, the attackers spoof the SRC IP.\nStresser services are not necessary illegal and there are many legitimate uses for such tools. Most legitimate services will require you to provide proof that you own the website and have agreed to the network test. Unfortunately, most of the stresser services that we have observed do not require you to submit proof, let alone verify the email address used to register an account. Instead they try to hide behind their Terms of Service by putting the legal responsibility back onto those carrying out the attacks.\nPirateStress ToS\nIn addition to these services playing fast and loose, they are also targeted by law enforcement and criminal hackers. Most notable, last year the alleged operators, Yarden Bidani and Itay Huri, of a popular stresser service called VDoS were arrested in Israel on the behest of the FBI and accused of launching more than 150,000 attacks from its platform.\n [You might also like: The Rise of Booter and Stresser Services]\nMore recently, at the beginning of September, Researcher Derrick Farmer discovered a file posted on Pastebin.com that detailed a recent breach of a stresser service called TrueStress.  The leak contained the details of 331 users including their username, password and email. The dump also included API details showing the TrueStresser was using an upstream DDoS-as-a-Service provider, Defcon.pro, to launch its attacks.\nData dump from PirateStress.pro\nOn August 25th, Radware’s Research division discovered another post on Pastebin that detailed the breach of a stresser service called PriateStress.pro. This leak came shortly after the dox of the alleged admin of Piratestress.pro, Kamikazi. The PirateStress.pro database was leaked by Packet.World and contained the details of 842 users, the attack logs and other information related to the service. Out of the 842 users in the database, 533 users used Gmail accounts for registration. Like many other services, Piratestress.pro does not verify registrants’ email addresses, allowing users the ability to register anonymously and use the service for malicious activity. The PirateStress dump also included an attack log of 2,432 attacks. After analyzing the attacks, it was determined that only 845 are unique targets.\nThe entry level package for PirateStresser is $10 a month and gives a user access to six attack vectors including LDAP, RAW-UDP, VSE, OVH bypass, DNS, and a generic bypass method. The Diamond packs for $80 dollars a month give a user access to 11 attack vectors for 30 days. Additionally, it appears that at one point in time, Piratestress.pro sold API access to other stresser services similar to Defcon.pro.\nAttack vectors offered via Piratestress.pro\nOn a funny note, at the moment BTC payments are disabled and currently only taking payments via an Israeli PayPal payment page with the owner’s Gmail address, dropitgaming1@gmail.com, exposed.\nPaypal payment page for Piratestress.pro\nThese services can be very profitable for the operators.

You probably do not write paper checks and sign them. You have an app on your phone to access your bank account and use one of the thousands of automated teller machines (ATM), around the world to move money in and out of your accounts.\n\n\nThe financial world is very different with the advent of the internet and near real-time information.  Gone is the time when Leonardo DiCaprio Frank Abagnale Jr. can forge checks and cash them at banks around the country.  Today’s verification systems will flag the bad check immediately through online record matching.  All of this information flying between branches and banks through the network depends on security technologies to protect the money as well as the personal information tied to all of the bank accounts and transactions.\nFinancial institutions have a responsibility to protect sensitive information on their systems and through their networks.  The business must protect the data at rest, the data in transit, and the systems holding and transmitting the data.\nData at rest\nEncryption algorithms and hashes are used to obscure the data within the applications and databases. There are many methods to protect the databases varying from field level encryption to solutions that encrypt the entire database. The method used often depends on the application requirements and how often individual records within the database are being updated.\nAll financial and personal information within these databases are vulnerable. The encryption protects the data even if the database is stolen by a malicious person. Without the proper key or credentials, the hacker will not be able to decipher the contents of the database.\n [You might also like: 5 Key Items for the Digital Transformation of Healthcare]\nData in transit\nFor the past 20 years, SSL/TLS has been the encryption standard for communications over the network. The algorithms to encrypt the data have advanced as computer technologies have improved over the years. Today, the internet is using the RSA algorithm with 2K keys to encrypt data on the network. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is emerging as a new standard with 256-bit keys to address the advancements in computing power.\nThe encryption standards and keys are important because the data is most vulnerable when it is in transit. The original data is often unencrypted so it is important for the network transport protocol to provide security and encryption. This is like taking a valuable item out of the secure vault and transporting it within a protected armored car to the destination, hopefully another vault. SSL/TLS is the armored car for the internet.\nSystems accessing data\nThe data is not the only concern for financial institutions. They need to be concerned with the applications and tools that have access to the data. If the vault is compromised, it does not matter how strong or secure the armored car is. This is most likely what happened in the recent Equifax case. They used an application that had a vulnerability that the hackers exploited to access the data.\nBusinesses often assume that the applications accessing the data are secure. There are two problems with this assumption. First, as in the Equifax case, the application is not secure. There are vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited to access sensitive information. Applications need to be validated through a process to ensure that they are secure.\nThe second problem is that people access the data through the applications. People are the weakest link in the security chain. They can accidentally share their credentials, download malware, or expose sensitive data. Policies and security technologies need to be implemented to minimize the potential negative impact of an inadvertent or intentional mistake that a person makes.\nInspecting and securing the data\nThe application delivery controller (ADC) provides three key functions to secure the data within the financial institution. As a reverse proxy or load balancer, the ADC is a key network component to make the application data available and secure.\n [You might also like: SSL Attacks – When Hackers Use Security Against You]\nThe ADC is the SSL/TLS termination point for the network communications. It needs to offer high performance encryption and decryption while supporting today’s RSA encryption standard and tomorrow’s ECC algorithm. Over 50% of the internet is encrypted today, and it is assumed that the financial services traffic percentage is higher due to its sensitivity.\nInbound SSL inspection solutions are necessary to protect the applications from threats. As the encryption termination point, the ADC can steer the decrypted content to different security solutions to inspect the traffic before it reaches the application. Financial institutions may use web application firewalls (WAF), next generation firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and/or data loss prevention (DLP) technologies to protect their applications and servers.\nFinally, the ADC provides outbound SSL inspection capabilities to protect the people from the internet threats. Outbound SSL inspection solutions decrypt and steer traffic between the users and the internet to security solutions. The security solutions look for malware, phishing sites, and other internet threats to protect the users and their internal systems.\nFinancial data is sensitive and vulnerable with the potential to affect every single person, if exposed. All businesses involved in the financial services industry must do their due diligence and ensure that appropriate architectures and solutions are put in place to protect the information that they manage. It is almost impossible to do too much to protect this information. If they do not take a fresh look at their security policies and practices, the Equifax breach may be the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'Application Delivery Controller\', \'Finance\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/09/financial-institutions-must-protect-data/');

We knew that we would have the opportunity to make some investment in smart tech. When Amazon sent a Smart Home Consultant to our house, they said we were farther ahead than most of the people they met with. I was trying to get them to help me make my lights flash blue and green when the Seahawks NFL team scored a touchdown. Weâve since solved that problem, and along the way, we had to take many important security measures.\n\nThe Snoo became our primary concern. Snoo Smart Crib is what we call the âmagic knockout cribâ for our newborn child. It connects to the Wi-Fi, then logs into the cloud, and based on the intensity and crying of our baby, it shushes, swaddles, shakes, or makes heartbeat sounds until she calms and falls back asleep, It listens to her and makes white noise, and can increase to the sound she would hear inside the womb with an internal heartbeat. If baby doesnât comfort, it sends an alert to our smartphones that we may need to feed or change the baby. The first thing I wanted to do was hack it so I could make it sound like my car shifting gears and see what kinds of vulnerabilities this might have as a listening device and potential two-way communication. Since it was directly in the baby bassinet, I was concerned. What if hackers started doing rotten things to our Snoo?\nA number of years back, we invested in a Unified Threat Manager (UTM) for home. Because speed, performance and ease of use was key, we actually have a commercial, enterprise-grade Next Gen Firewall or UTM. Having Intrusion Prevention Systems, Inline Antivirus, Desktop Endpoint Protection, SSL VPN, QOS for our VOIP system, Advanced Filtering (web and content), it all seemed like a lot to take into the home. After a while, weâve found use for so many of the features and will continue to use these features as our child grows. The ability to censor the internet for our children to protect them from things we donât want them to see is fantastic. Central Antivirus for the family with inline IPS is great. For the camera systems, being able to have a Web Application Firewall and brute force protection is valuable, especially considering the Mirai botnet is mostly IP Cameras.\n [You might also like: From BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks.]\nNext we invested in more of the smart things, so almost every light in the house is a smart light bulb. With an app on the phone, Apple Home Kit, Siri, Alexa and If This Then That (IFTTT), we were able to build a large Zigbee Mesh network. All of the lights act as repeaters for the Zigbee wireless transmission. So the âMan Caveâ (my office in the yard) is properly named as such. When the lock gets unlocked, it sends a signal to the digital smart lock system to IFTTT, which tells it to turn on the âMan Cave Light Groupâ. This is the same for the front door: unlock the front door, and the lights come on in the front room. Alexa (Amazon Echo) is around the house, so âAlexa, turn on kitchen lightâ is the way the lights go on in the kitchen. With IFTTT, we did some integration to have Alexa flash lights when the timer is over. âAlexa, set timer for 10 minutesâ results in the kitchen lights flashing when the timer is done and our food is ready.\nWith smart smoke detectors, we were able to change the colors of the lights, or flash the lights in the house if smoke or carbon monoxide is detected, as well as make audio alarms run all over the home. We can have the system send alerts to text messages, or have the app put alerts onto the phone directly, and this allows me to know if thereâs a problem at the home. All of the integrations for this can tie into the smart alarm systems as well, so a monitoring company can also know if youâve got an issue at the house. One of the things that really was frustrating with the smoke detectors was that I wanted the motion alarm on them to trigger events. They have lights that you can program, so they become motion-sensing night lights. I wanted to set them up so that on motion (near the stairs), the color light strip going down the stairway would turn on for five minutes. They have triggers for smoke detection, but no API extension for the motion. So, I had to punt, and programmed at dusk, to turn on the stairs lights and at dawn, turn them off.\n\nMany of the new smart alarms today have ZigBee wireless, so you can integrate motion sensing cameras, water leak detectors, glass break sensors, etc. The better systems have integration directly with a number of smart home systems, so that should you decide to start programming your smart home, youâll have an easier path. One of the things that Iâve yet to see is a wave of new âsmart homeâ tech integrators that will know the answers to many of your questions. For now, it seems, a lot of it is market adoption for smart devices and smart things, and a few of the tech giants are starting to build their ecosystems. Amazon, Apple, and Google are some of the leaders in the automation space today and many more are going to be coming.\nOne of the things we have not done (yet) is investing in smart blinds for the windows. When the sun comes up, the blinds can start to let natural light into the rooms you choose. This can be very cost-effective for heating and cooling if you do it right. The idea of being able to say âAlexa, open living room blindsâ and having them all move is exciting to me. Currently, for the system we want, itâs a little cost prohibitive, so we may wait for more competitors to hit the market.\n [You might also like: IoT Threats: Whose problem is it?]\nThe most important thing weâve done along the way is to make certain that we are aware of what and where the connections are going. As a security person, these systems can be very vulnerable. Consumer-based products tend to not get patched frequently. All of the firewall, IPS, and WAF rules for every system might seem a bit overkill, but it would not be funny if my printer was the cause of a full âHomePocalypseâ hacking meltdown. For devices like our SCADA network (solar and electrical grid), it has no need to talk to my lights or alarm, so it got its own DMZ and rules. The cool factor was being able to get a unique view of the solar eclipse this year, from a solar panelâs perspective on a smart phone:\n\nWhen I think about how to penetration test my network, I look at the threat surfaces. Can I break into the cameras, can I break into the cloud accounts, can I poison the smart TV, can I wirelessly attack the network?Â  For the cameras, my strategy was simple: VPN in and then access them. That proved to be more difficult for everyone to use. So, moving to the next phase: use high ephemeral ports instead of well-known ports, and use brute force protection, Web Application Firewall, Server Cracking Protection, inline IPS signatures, and use VERY strong passwords like âFrostAndSullivan2017Winner!!!â for an admin username that is no longer âadmin.â This will shut down most botnets attempting to log into the cameras.Â  Is it impossible to break in?Â  No, but itâs going to be very expensive to accomplish it, and thereâ are easier attack surfaces. The Wi-Fi uses full active defense with spare radios being used for scanning for nearby attackers.Â  Passwords are 30-40 characters long.\nIn a way, we planned this out as if we were responsible corporate Security Engineers. Not everyone today is going to have the time, knowledge, or resources to do this, and this is why the IoT has been such a threat. Home automation and the Internet of Things is fantastic and very fun. Playing Security Engineer at home can also be fun, but this is mandatory if you want to sleep well at night about having so many smart things in your home.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'Smart Technology\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/09/smart-homes-iot/');

Data security and application availability are essential when a patient’s medical information is on the network. Hospitals and medical practices are digitizing healthcare applications like x-rays, CAT scans, medication distribution and surgical procedures using interactive video. In addition, patient care staff are accessing all of this medical information on tablets, phones, and other devices in real-time.\n\n\nEvery second really counts when we are referring to healthcare IT infrastructures. In addition, the security of the data is essential as the most personal and identifying information is within the protected health information (PHI) within an individual’s records. The networks of the healthcare industry have to be the most resilient and protected considering the possible catastrophic outcomes that lead to loss of life.\nDigital transformation means IT transformation\nThere are five items that any IT professional in the healthcare industry should address when designing and managing their digitized medical infrastructure.\n\nLatency is deadly – If the medical information is not available when the healthcare professional needs it, there is an impact to the patient’s well-being. Applications and their data need to be up 100% of the time or lives are at risk.  The quality of the patient care decreases exponentially the longer it takes the medical staff to access the records.\n\n\nOperational visibility is critical – Medical facilities must have SLAs defined for application and data access. Different applications will have different SLAs defined for them based on their design and importance towards delivering quality healthcare services.  Once the SLAs are defined, the IT organization must have tools to monitor the IT infrastructure’s adherence to the SLAs and tools to identify and implement solutions to fix the problems.\n\n [You might also like: Hospital Stays Can Take Out More Than Your Organs]\n\nMedical data is bulky – Many of the applications and diagnostic tools used in the healthcare industry are visual and contain large amounts of data within high-resolution images. Medical exam files are large. An average x-ray is 8MB and other imaging systems can produce files over 100MB in size.  An average patient exam is approximately 200MB.  This means the network infrastructure must support high bandwidth file transfers.  These transfers must be done quickly and securely.  The application delivery technologies must provide high-performance encryption and application acceleration technologies to make the access to medical records timely.\n\n\nHackers want the data – Endpoint protection as well as perimeter and network security solutions must be used to restrict the access to the PHI only to the professionals that have the proper credentials. IT organizations must implement the latest encryption standards like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).  Malware, specifically ransomware, is rampant.  Security means the medical facilities need an outbound SSL inspection solution to protect their assets from malicious sites, email, and exploits.\n\n\nAvailability rules them all – All of this data is flying through the medical facilities through wires and wirelessly from monitoring machines and diagnostic equipment to storage systems, servers, tablets, phones, and a plethora of other devices. A robust IT architecture can eliminate single points of failure and ensure that anyone, anywhere, can access the information at any time.  Technologies like server load balancing (SLB) and global server load balancing (GSLB) create an environment that can guarantee application and data access.\n\nEvery second counts when lives are at stake\nWhen the business literally affects peoples’ lives, it is essential to make sure that there is no loss of service. The digital transformation of healthcare means that the network infrastructure must be built to be robust and resilient. Any negative impact to the delivery and security of the medical information can have profound repercussions for patient privacy and ultimately their well-being.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Encryption\', \'Healthcare\', \'load balancing\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/09/digital-transformation-healthcare/');

All of that is available today on the Darknet, and you don’t need to be a sophisticated hacker to get access and start “enjoying” it all.\n\n\nIn this past year, they’ve taken it a huge step further – Internet of Things (IoT) botnets.  Hackers are taking control of all those relatively insecure IoT devices out in the world and leveraging them to create even more powerful, more sophisticated attacks.  These recent IoT threats have spawned the largest DDoS attacks in history, propelling the market into the 1Tbps DDoS era.\nThese hackers are leveraging Burst attacks and Advanced Persistent DDoS (APDoS) campaigns to launch multi-vector, blended campaigns that combine high volume network vectors with sophisticated, application-layer attacks.\nSo, yes, it does feel like hackers got it easy.\nThat’s not the case for the rest of us – the good guys – trying to stay protected and keep our networks, applications, and information secure.\n [You might also like: 2017’s 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 1)]\nWe have a challenge to keep up with these hackers and continuously evolve protections.  Protecting from the “common” DDoS attacks is no longer enough.  You need to ask yourself if your organization is prepared to handle Ransom DoS (RDoS) attacks, DNS Water Torture attacks, SSL floods, APDoS, application layer attacks and more.\nWhen choosing a DDoS protection solution, make sure it can protect from these threats.

Everything from hacktivist motivated ransomware attacks to Internet of Things (IoT) assaults targeted the financial sector, resulting in hundreds of millions in lost revenue.Â  Much of this is in the noise among the large national and international banking headlines.Â  However, the vulnerability gaps for smaller financial entities, and the corresponding opportunity for Managed Security Service Providers to provide them protection is incredible.\nA report by Beazley Breach Response (BBR) Services found that in 2016 banks and credit unions with less than $35 million in annual revenue accounted for 81 percent of hacking and malware breaches at financial institutions in 2016, a major increase over the 54 percent of incidents they represented the year prior.\nPerhaps more than any other industry, security professionals at financial service firms truly are on the frontlines of todayâs cyberattacks, combating everything from ransomware attacks to SSL-based attacks.\n [You might also like: Hospital Stays Can Take Out More Than Your Organs]\nThe Plexi Glass at the Currency Exchange is Not Enough\nIn the simplest cases cyber-criminals will attack small banks and credit unions to steal money. Â For example, in Battle Creek, Michigan a fraudulent wire transfer of $121,000 was reported by the Kellogg Community Credit Union. In this case police indicated that the attacker hacked the credit union records for another member and changed the contact phone number so when credit union officials called to verify the transfer they talked with the suspect and not the actual member.Â  Attacks can run the gamut of very straightforward and simple to extremely complex.\nMany financial entities deploy a firewall to protect infiltration from outside their internal network.Â  However, the majority of Distributed Denial of Service (or âDDoSâ) attacks are beyond what a firewall can protect against. When stateful devices like firewalls are used in an attempt to prevent DDoS attacks, there is a significant architectural vulnerability. Security attacks may trigger a large number of new connections in state tables, which requires internal resources to manage the load. These internal resources can easily be overrun in an attack scenario. Additionally, DDoS attacks arenât simply about connections â they may also include attacks within applications.\nWhy should Small Money care? Because they are prime attack targets.\nAs institutions continue to offer more services through the web, the mix of applications that must be supported to service customers and employees grows more complex.Â  Branch bank managers, risk and compliance officers and contact center agents have new job requirements and must stay on top of the inherent issues associated with the “new way” of conducting business. Applications need to be consistently available and performance cannot waver. Security is vital. Confidentiality is not only expected, it’s legally required to comply with regulations that require the safeguarding of information such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the California Senate Bill 1386.\nCyber criminals are focusing on attacking smaller banks and credit union computer systems because once inside the firewall the number of connected stakeholders they have access to multiplies â to end customers, parent banks, partners, etc. According to a Boston Globe report, âCyber-criminals are already testing this route. About a year ago, a small Boston-area bank discovered during a routine check that hackers had invaded its computer systems, Montgomery said.

This is the least risky of the options, and requires no upfront capital. Itâs also the fastest way to bring a service to the market. The carrier gets to focus on sales, marketing, and back-office support, but delegates the security expertise and the technology to a partner. This can be sold as a part of connectivity or compute/storage services as part of a high-value bundle.\nBuild your own service. This takes the most time, capital, and resources, but also offers the highest margins and overall NPV. If you have an in-house IT team that can operate and manage a network security solution, you can maximize your return on investment.\nGet the best of both worlds. A third option is to start with a white-labeled service before transitioning to managing it in-house. You forego large capital expenditures up front so you can focus on marketing and selling the service while building back-office operations and expertise.

To read Part 1 of the series, click here. Let’s dive back in with Attack Type #4:\n\n\nATTACK TYPE #4: Fire & Forget: PDoS â Permanent Denial of Service\nA permanent denial-of-service attack (PDoS attack), also known loosely as phlashing in some circles, is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. By exploiting security flaws or misconfigurations, PDoS can destroy the firmware and/or basic functions of system. It is a contrast to its well-known cousin, the DDoS attack, which overloads systems with requests meant to saturate resources through unintended usage.\nOne method PDoS uses to accomplish its damage is via remote or physical administration on the management interfaces of the victim’s hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. In the case of firmware attacks, the attacker may use vulnerabilities to replace a device’s basic software with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware imageâa process which when done legitimately is known as flashing. This therefore “bricks” the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced. Other attacks include overloading the battery or power systems.\nWhy Bother with Temporary Outages when you can Achieve Permanent?\nImagine a fast moving bot attack designed not to collect data but rather to completely prevent a victimâs technology from functioning. Sounds unlikely, but itâs possible. Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attacks have been around for a long time; however, this type of attack shows itself spectacularly to the public only time to time.\nThe most recent example was BrickerBot, which Radware discovered in April, 2017. Over a four-day period, BrickerBot launched thousands of PDoS attempts from various locations leveraging Telnet vulnerabilities to breach a victimâs devices.\nIn a recent article published by Help Net Security, they detailed how a new USB exploit can be inserted into a computer and render a computer bricked.Â  In fact, according to Help Net, the latest PDoS USB attack âwhen plugged into a computer â¦ draws power from the device itself. Â With the help of a voltage converter, the device’s capacitors are charged to 220V, and it releases a negative electric surge into the USB port.â\n [You might also like: From BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks.]\nAnother example, covered in a 2008 article in Dark Reading, additionally highlighted a tool uncovered by HP Labs called PhlashDance. Â This tool was leveraged to find vulnerabilities in often forgotten firmware and binaries that sit localized on computing devices.Â  The risk lies in the lack of patches and upgrades made to the devices.\nThis article goes on to say that âremotely abusing firmware update mechanisms with a phlashing attack, for instance, is basically a one-shot attack.Â  Phlashing attacks can achieve the goal of disrupting service without ongoing expense to the attacker; once the firmware has been corrupted, no further action is required for the DOS condition to continue.â\nAssessing Risks & Taking Action\nThe following behaviors and trends may increase the risk of a PDoS attack targeting your organization.\n– Running a highly virtualized environment that leverages a few hardware devices, but powerfully overloads software functions. One PDoS on the platform can create a disaster recovery situation. This includes Software Defined Networks (SDNs).\n– Organizations highly dependent on IoT. âThingsâ are highly susceptible to PDoS as they are often simple devices with little to no inherent security measures.\n– Organizations with centralized security gateways. One powerful PDoS can punch a hole in your attack detection and mitigation capabilities.\n– Organizations that are considered critical infrastructure.\nThe clear action to take is to conduct an assessment on the type of technology you are running at or below the operating system level. Develop a clear understanding of the different firmware versions, binaries, chip-level software (like ASICs and FPGA) and technology that is in use in your environment. Also consider batteries, power systems and fan system vulnerabilities.\nAssessing the likelihood and risk of a PDoS attack can help your organization take the necessary precautions and onboarding controls to protect your most critical assets. Education is an important step in evaluating your risk of PDoS attacks.\n [You might also like: Chatting With IoT Bots]\nATTACK TYPE #5: IoT Botnets and the Economics Of DDoS Protection\n2016 brought a long-feared DDoS threat to fruition: cyber-attacks that are launched from multiple connected devices turned into botnets. Botnets are one of the fastest growing and fluid threats facing cyber security experts today and have propelled us into the 1Tbps DDoS era.\nFirst, here is a timeline of the most notable attacks in 2016/17 that propelled botnets into the front pages and onto the desks of C-suite executives.\nJune 28, 2016: PCWorld reports that â25,000 digital video recorders and CCTV cameras were compromised and used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, flooded targets with about 50,000 HTTP requests per second.â Though impressive and startling, this attack said nothing about what was still to come.\nSeptember 20, 2016: Around 8:00 pm, KrebsOnSecurity.com becomes the target of a record-breaking 620Gbps volumetric DDoS attack from a botnet designed to take the site offline.\nSeptember 21, 2016: The same type of botnet is used in a 1Tbps attack targeting the French web host OVH. A few days later, the IoT botnet source code goes publicâspawning what would become the âmarqueeâ attack of the year.\nOctober 21, 2016: Dyn, a US-based DNS provider that many Fortune 500 companies rely on, is attacked by the same botnet in what is publicly known as a âwater tortureâ attack (see below). The attack renders many services unreachable and causes massive connectivity issuesâmostly along the East Coast of the United States.\nApril 5, 2017: Radware discovers BrickerBot, which over a four-day period, launches thousands of PDoS attempts from various locations around the world. BrickerBot uses Telnet brute force â the same exploit leveraged by Mirai â to breach a victimâs devices.\nThe Appeal of Internet of Things (IoT) Devices\nFor hackers, IoT devices are attractive targets for several reasons:\n\nIoT devices usually fall short when it gets to endpoint DDoS protection implementation.\nUnlike PCs and servers, there are no regulations or standards for secure use of IoT devices. Such regulations help ensure secured configurations and practices. Among them: changing default passwords and implementing access control restrictions (for example, to disable remote access to administrative ports).\nIoT devices operate 24×7 and can be in use at any moment.\n\nAccording to Radwareâs 2016 â 2017 Global Application & Network Security Report, 52% of security professionals indicated that they do not believe IoT botnets complicate mitigation or increase detection requirements.\nFigure 1: IoT threat impact as perceived by cyber-security professionals.\nBotnets: Making Use of Different Attack Vectors\nThe Mirai botnet provides a perfect example of the various attack vectors one IoT botnet can unleash on its victims. We can all thank a user named âAnna-senpaiâ for publishing the Mirai source code to a public and easily accessible forum. In short order, the code spread to numerous locations, including several GitHub repositories, where hackers began taking a closer look. Since then, the Mirai botnet has been infecting hundreds of thousands of IoT devicesâturning them into a âzombie armyâ capable of launching powerful volumetric DDoS attacks. Security researchers estimate that there are millions of vulnerable IoT devices actively taking part in these coordinated attacks.\n [You might also like: The offspring of two comic book giants bring us the Bot Squad! Super freaky!]\nIn a surprising departure from previous record-holding amplification attacks, attackers did not use DNS and NTP. Instead, these attacks consisted mainly of TCP-SYN, TCP-ACK and TCP-ACK + PSH along with HTTP and non-amplified UDP floods. In the case of KrebsOnSecurity, the biggest chunk of attack traffic came in the form of GRE, which is highly unusual. In the OVH attack, more than 140,000 unique IPs were reported in what seemed to be a SYN and ACK flood attack followed by short bursts over 100Gbps each over a four-day period.\nThe Economics of Botnets\nWhile much has been discussed around Mirai, IoT, âthe rise of the machinesâ and other catchy buzz-phrases, we believe one of the most disruptive changes is the new economics model of IoT botnets.\nNot so long ago, hackers were investing a great deal of money, time and effort to scan the Internet for vulnerable servers, build their zombie bots army and then safeguard it against other hackers who might also want to claim ownership of them. All the while, hackers would keep continual watch for new infection targets that could join their zombie army.\nThings have changed: There are now millions of vulnerable devices sitting with default credentials. Bot mastersâthe authors and owners of the botnetsâdo not even bother to secure their bots after infection. After all, as Mirai demonstrates, it does not even persist infection to disk, so a simple device reboot brings it back to clean and healthy state.\nFor a bot master, gaining control of powerful servers would cost hundreds of dollars every month. Often he or she would gain illegal access to it and work diligently to hide it from others. Finding these servers was and still is difficult and expensive.\nNow with IoT botnets, instead of spending months of effort and hundreds of dollars to control a few powerful servers and several hundred infected PCs, bot masters can take control of millions of IoT devices with near zero cost.\nKnowledge is Power\nBotnets will be an ongoing tale as threats, detection and DDoS mitigation solutions continuously change. Knowledge is the key to staying ahead of the menace.

For example, the defensive advantage of the Greek phalanx was eventually outmaneuvered by the Roman legion. Later, improvements in fortifications and armor led to castles and ironclad knights, until the invention of gunpowder made them obsolete. In the 20th century, fixed fortifications and trenches were rendered outdated by highly mobile armored forces. In all these examples, the common denominator is that one sideâs tactical advantage spawned new ways of thinking among its opponents, eventually degrading that advantage or reversing it completely.\n\nEnter the digital age, where lines of code and terabytes of information determine who has the tactical advantage. Of late, the pendulum has swung in favor of cyber-attacks. Rate-based technologies, once considered adequate to handle the most advanced distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) threats, have fallen obsolete as tech-savvy adversaries move beyond the static concepts of most conservative corporate budgets and know how to overcome name-brand mitigation technologies. These ultra-adaptive hackers have given rise to the top five nastiest attack techniques in 2017.\n\nATTACK TYPE #1:Â  Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS):\nWikipedia defines APDoS as:\nââ¦a clear and emerging threat needing specialized monitoring and incident response services and the defensive capabilities of specialized DDoS mitigation service providers. This type of attack involves massive network layer DDoS attacks through to focused application layer (HTTP) floods, followed by repeated (at varying intervals) SQLI and XSS attacks. Typically, the perpetrators can simultaneously use between 2 to 5 attack vectors involving up to several tens of millions of requests per second, often accompanied by large SYN floods that can not only attack the victim but also any service provider implementing any sort of managed DDoS mitigation capability. These attacks can persist for several weeks.â\nIt becomes clear that APDoS requires an array of technologies to stop the network floods, HTTP application-level DDoS and encrypted threats. Moreover, Radware is witnessing these attack techniques manifest into SMTP attacks (a relatively new vector) and secure-SMTP such as TLS over SMTP.\nAPDoS attacks assume many forms, but typically attackers will switch tactically between several targets to create a diversion to fool mitigation tools, all the while eventually concentrating the main thrust of the attack onto a single victim. To successfully mitigate these threats, organizations must understand the threat and make certain it has certain protections in place (e.g. high caliber detection and mitigation). To start, characterize APDoS threats into the following classes:\n [You might also like: Dry Lighting Cracks against the Cloud: The Rise of the Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)]\n\nÂ âAdvanced reconnaissance (pre-attack OSINT and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)\nTactical execution (attack with a primary and secondary victims but focus is on primary)\nExplicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)\nLarge computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth resources)\nSimultaneous multi-threaded ISO layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)\nPersistence over extended periods (utilizing all the above into a concerted, well managed attack across a range of targets)â\n\nThe task is daunting and real. As the next generation of DDoS threats emerge, organizations must be diligent and proactive. Companies must rise above the normal corporate culture of security controls and become obsessive about removing risks and compulsive about action. After all, these organizations may literally be holding life and death decisions in their hands â and this makes their actions rather profound and very unique.\nATTACK TYPE #2: DNS Water Torture Attack\nA DNS NXDOMAIN flood attack, which is also known as a water torture attack, targets an organization’s DNS servers. This type of attack involves a flood of maliciously crafted, DNS lookup requests. Intermediate resolvers also experience delays and timeouts while waiting for the end target’s authoritative name server to respond to the requests. These requests consume network, bandwidth and storage resources. They can also tie up network connections, causing timeouts.\nBy understanding the threat, an organization can comprehend two of the largest problems in solving this attack vector:\n\nFirst: The attacker is coming from a known legitimate source and canât realistically be blocked while still maintain healthy DNS resolution operations over the long term\nSecond: The attacker source is actually also querying legitimate requests at the same time illegitimate requests are being sent.\n\nTo counter this resource-draining threat, organizations should monitor their recursive DNS servers, keeping a keen eye for anomalous behavior such as spikes in the number of unique sub-domains being queried or spikes in the number of timeouts or delayed responses from a given name server.\nAny DNS attack mitigation tool must meet unique challenges. Beyond a limited set of vendors, there is no real automated solution to mitigate this threat, as the tool must contain the following attributes:\nMitigation tools must have deep knowledge of DNS traffic behavior â The tool must understand DNS traffic and âlearnâ or establish baseline behaviors continuously to immediately identify abnormal DNS traffic. Moreover, the tool or technique must analyze every field in DNS traffic to identify abnormal packets and to create real time signatures.\nMitigating high rate of DNS packets – The tool must be able to challenge large amounts of DNS queries per second and to process up to â often in larger circuits – 10- 35 million packets per second of attack traffic. The attack traffic does not affect legitimate traffic while under attack.\nMitigation accuracy â With unique DNS challenges and accurate analyzing of DNS traffic behavior, an organization must be able to accurately distinguish between legitimate DNS traffic and attack-based DNS traffic to minimize false positives. This enables the service provider to continue and serve its legitimate users even under severe attack.\nProvide best quality of experience even under attack â Obviously the idea of operating a service is that you must have an architecture that can guarantee minimum latency to all processed traffic, and especially to the legitimate traffic. This guarantees a best quality of experience to legitimate internet users even under attack.\n [You might also like: To stay secure: Four new SSL implementation thoughts]\nATTACK TYPE #3:Â  Friend Turned Enemy: SSL-Based Cyber Attacks\nThere is a new set of challenges facing organizations leveraging encryption technologies. Cyber-attacks, including DDoS attacks and advanced web application attacks, continue to plague businesses as they continuously shift operations online. For both types of assaults, those leveraging encrypted traffic as an attack vector are on the rise, further challenging current security solutions. Most mitigation technologies do not actually inspect SSL traffic, as it requires decrypting/encrypting traffic. Recent surveys show that between 25% – 35% of enterprise communication sent via an LAN and WAN is SSL-encrypted traffic.\nSSL-based attacks take many forms, including:\n\nEncrypted SYN Floods: These attacks are similar to standard, non-encrypted SYN flood attacks in that they seek to exhaust the resources in place to complete the SYN-ACK handshake, only they further complicate the challenge by encrypting traffic and forcing resource use of SSL handshake resources.\nSSL Renegotiation: These attacks work by initiating a regular SSL handshake and then immediately request the renegotiation of the encryption key. The tool repeats this renegotiation request until all server resources have been exhausted.\nHTTPS Floods: These attacks generate floods of encrypted HTTP traffic, often as part of multi-vector attack campaigns. Compounding the impact of ânormalâ HTTP floods, encrypted HTTP attacks add several other challenges, such as the burden of encryption and decryption mechanisms.\nEncrypted Web Application Attacks: Multi-vector attack campaigns also increasingly leverage non-DoS, web application logic attacks. By encrypting the traffic masking these advanced attacks, they often pass through both DDoS and web application protections undetected.\n\nIn the same way SSL and encryption protect the integrity of legitimate communications, they effectively obfuscate many of the attributes used to determine if traffic is malicious or legitimate. Identifying attack traffic within encrypted traffic flows is akin to finding a needle in a haystack . . . in the dark. Most cyber-attack solutions struggle mightily to identify potentially malicious traffic from encrypted traffic sources and isolate that traffic for further analysis (and potential mitigation).\nThe other major advantage that SSL attacks offer to attackers is the ability to put significant computing stress on network and application infrastructures they target. The process of decrypting and re-encrypting SSL traffic increases the requirements of processing the traffic, in many cases beyond the functional performance of devices used for attack mitigation. In a recent report, Gartner Research notes that less than 20% of organizations using common security technologies (firewall, IPS) are inspecting inbound or outbound encrypted traffic.\nEven the most advanced mitigation technologies have gaps in their encryption-based protections. Few of these solutions can be deployed out-of-path, which is a necessity for providing protection while limiting the impact on legitimate users. Many solutions that can do some level of decryption tend to rely on rate-limiting requests, thereby resulting in dropped legitimate traffic. Finally, many solutions require the customer to share actual server certificates, which complicates implementation, certificate management and forces customers to share private keys for protection in the cloud. Here are some tips to consider when considering DDoS protection from encrypted attacks:\n\nStateless mitigation: As previously mentioned, many security technologies are stateful in nature, meaning they maintain state throughout a session. This requires additional computing resources and poses the risk of filling session tables, at which point the device will fall over. Be sure the technologies youâre depending on for encrypted attack protection are stateless in nature to ensure ability to scale to the higher demands of these attacks.\nAsymmetric deployment options: Most security technologies rely on a symmetric deployment model, meaning they are in the path for both inbound and outbound traffic. This has key benefits for some aspects of security, but in the case of encrypted attack mitigation, adds unnecessary computational strain on the solution. Look for DDoS attack prevention technologies that can support an asymmetric deployment where only ingress encrypted traffic passes through the mitigation engine.\nCertificate management: Some security technologies that claim to cover encrypted attacks do so at the burden of operations teams that manage server certificates. Specifically, these technologies require the sharing of the actual web server certificates, meaning any change to these certificates have to be replicated in the security solution. Look for a DDoS service that can manage the inspection of encrypted traffic through use of certificates legitimately issued to the organization but not tied specifically to the web server.\nEnsuring integrity of the trust model: One of the principles behind website authentication through certificates is the confirmation to the end customer that they are engaged in a âprivateâ communication with the intended organizations. Some service providers offer SSL capabilities that break this trust model and actually initiate a secure channel between the unknowing end user and themselves. In so doing, they essentially dup the end user into trusting them with the shared information (as well as the service providerâs certificate management).\nOptimizing legitimate user experience: As is so often the case, IT and security professionals are left to strike a balance between having lightweight security and creating such a locked-down user experience as to chase away customers. This balancing act plays out in encrypted attack mitigation as well, where some technologies employ something of an on/off switch for decrypting all encrypted traffic when a potential attack is detected. Look for technologies that can selectively apply challenge-and-response specifically to traffic identified as suspicious, thereby maintaining user experience for legitimate users sending through encrypted traffic.\n\nThe fact that many organizations are seeing an increase in encrypted traffic is, in general, a good thing. It is however, a complicating factor when it comes to encrypted cyber-attacks. The bottom line is that to provide effective protection, solutions need to deliver full attack vector coverage (including SSL), high scalability to meet the growing demands of the consumer, and innovative ways to handle management of encryption technologies (today predominantly SSL/TLS) in a manner that can be operationalized effectively and efficiently.\nTo learn what #4 and #5 are in this list of the top DDoS attacks and how to mitigate them, stay tuned for Part 2 of this series.\n\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"2017âs 5 Most Dangerous DDoS Attacks & How to Mitigate Them (Part 1)\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/09/2017-5-most-dangerous-ddos-attacks/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Carl Herberger\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/top-5-ddos-attacks.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1261,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-09-12\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-09-12\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'apdos\', \'ddos\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/09/2017-5-most-dangerous-ddos-attacks/');

The group distributes the malware and leverages the infections to sell different services. Additional modules can be easily added to spread spam, worms and downloaders, and possibly information stealers – depending on the buyer’s intent. One of the latest modules that we saw in numerous installations (the tool is widely spread amongst different businesses in various geographical locations) is a Monero miner. Monero is a digital currency, perhaps the only one that can be mined on a regular PC CPU and does not require a more powerful hardware.\n\nCodeFork is a cautious group that invests in stealth. Their malware distribution campaign sheds some light on the dark halo where hackers operate. While it seems that security solutions are posing new challenges to them, and can easily protect against simple and novice attacks, wide operations are thoroughly planned well in advance, where tools are carefully evaluated and chosen. The modular, systematic behavior of the program reflects the composure of the hackers who operate it. A great endeavor is put forth by the group into evasion.

The initial infection is most likely done via an email attachment with a Microsoft Office document containing a malicious macro. Next, they take advantage of Window OS executables for the installation process, leaving no tracks on the disk.

This method bypasses local execution policies that might restrict running unrecognized PowerShell scripts. The script downloads an RC4 Encrypted DLL Executable and decrypts it. It then loads the malicious script reflectively from memory PowerSploit modules.\nUp until this point, there are no tracks left on the infected machine. Before proceeding, as another simple anti-analysis mechanism, the module checks for the path C:\\python27 on the machine, which normally indicates a security researcher’s machine or sandbox environment.\nTo remain on the infected machine after rebooting, two registry values are stored under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\[Random String]\n\nThe Powershell script for the next stage in base64.\nA new RC4 encrypted DLL module.\n\nThis is only artifact that remains on the machine.\nThe next module is a wrapper for the real malware.

This tactic makes it difficult for security solutions such as NGFWs and Secure Web Gateways to detect and block outbound communication to the C&C server. After the domain is generated, an HTTPS GET request is sent to download a malicious file, masquerading itself as a Googlebot crawler.\nCalculating a seed for the domain generation function\nCodeFork uses the same algorithm repeatedly in different modules, but with minor modifications each time. These are few examples:\n\nChanging the seed of the DGA function\nAdding an extra letter at the beginning of the domain\nRemoving two letters from the end\nMultiply the first letter\nUsing various subdomains\n\nThis has allowed us to identify domains that are being used now, and in the future, by CodeFork’s different modules without having to retrieve and fully analyze all of their modules.\n [You might also like: Network Security Does Not Matter When You Invite the Hacker Inside]\nIn the next step, the program executes an instance of the infamous Gamarue malware.

The group made sure to use process hollowing again – within another legitimate Windows process, before conducting its malicious behavior. To deter analysis of the module, the executable file does not possess an import table, making it hard to understand which Win APIs it uses.\nJMP instruction to the address of the original API\nUpon ongoing analysis of this and former CodeFork campaigns, we have seen Gamarue being used to download different modules (for different purposes) such as:\n\nNecrus Malware\nA USB-INFECTOR module for lateral infection\nUsing Microsoft’s cdosys.dll for spamming\n\nThis time, we discovered a new behavior, which is the Monero mining – the servers will instruct the Gamarue malware to download and execute a Monero Digital Currency CPU Miner, earning attackers cash.

When asked how easy they thought it would be for a student in grades 1-6 to hack a school, 15 percent of respondents said it was either somewhat easy (6 percent) or very easy (9 percent). The numbers rise with age. Some 57 percent think a high school student could easily hack a school, and 63 percent think an undergraduate would have no problem. These responses were part of a survey of 1,000 Americans conducted by SurveyMonkey on behalf of Radware.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason Americans think it is so easy for students to hack a school is that they do not have any idea whether schools are equipped to defend themselves. When asked to grade schools on their ability to protect students’ personal information, privacy, and safety, 45 percent simply selected “I don’t know” instead of assigning a letter grade.\n\nThat perceived lack of competence in protecting privacy could stem from personal experiences with school communications. Respondents reported that schools often aren’t educating students on how to better secure themselves online. Nearly half (48 percent) said they had never received communications from a school containing cyber-security tips or counsel on protecting themselves, students, and devices.\nStill, 76 percent of respondents said they were not aware of any schools or universities being affected by a cyber-attack, despite countless examples reported in the news.\n [You might also like: School Networks Getting Hacked – Is it the Students’ Fault?]\nOf course schools are often victims of cyber-attacks, in large part because they’re more vulnerable than the typical organization.

Of course that may be because schools estimate the cost of an attack at only $200,000, a fraction of the $500,000 expected by financial firms, the $800,000 by retailers, and the $1 million price tag foreseen by health care, government, and tech organizations.\nBut the relatively low estimated cost of an attack doesn’t mean attacks are any less disruptive. Nearly a third (31 percent) of attacks against schools are from angry users, a percentage far higher than in other industries. Some 57 percent of schools are hit with malware, the same percentage are victims of social engineering, and 46 percent have experienced ransom attacks.\nYet 44 percent of schools don’t have an emergency response plan.\nAs the new school year begins, and cyber-attacks inevitably delay class registration, expose students’ personal data, and disrupt online testing, schools and universities should not only revisit their cyber-security budgets, but do a better job of communicating with parents, students, faculty, and staff about staying safe.\nAnd if grade-schoolers are hacking their schools, their parents and teachers might want to pay closer attention to how they’re spending time online.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Education\', \'Hacking\', \'school\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/09/can-grade-schoolers-hack-schools/');

In their 2017 Data Breach survey, Verizon found that ransomware has jumped up from the 22nd most common type of malware in 2014 to the 5th most common. The report also discovered that 72% of all healthcare attacks in 2016 were ransomware and the only industry targeted more than health care is financial services.\n\nSmall hospitals, doctor’s offices, and clinics do a great job at making us well, which is their primary focus.  Cyber-attacks on electronic health records have historically not been top of mind.  Although the black market value of a health record is decreasing as compared to other stolen assets such as credit cards or social security numbers, it is still considered more profitable for the cyber-criminal. Healthcare entities have taken small steps in protecting sensitive data, but attacks continue to get more and more complex and can initiate from both the outside and inside of an organization. Just as small enterprises everywhere are searching for ways to shore up their protection and avoid business disruptions, healthcare organizations have an obligation to protect their business and their patients’ sensitive information.  Hospitals and doctors’ offices need help keeping their data secure.\n\nWhile that is concerning enough, the medical scare also goes a level further and could become a matter of life and death. What would happen if someone hacked into your pacemaker or insulin pump?  Cybersecurity expert Josh Corman, in a recent ABC news article, shared findings from a yearlong investigation citing that “about 85 percent or more of the hospitals don’t have a single qualified security person on staff.”  Add that to the fact that the operating computer is using an old, unsupported system like Windows XP and you have a lethal combination. The threat is so real that former Vice President Dick Cheney revealed on CBS’s “60 Minutes” in 2013 that he had the wireless capability on his pacemaker turned off.\n [You might also like: The Money Behind DDoS Managed Security Services]\nGood help can be hard to find, especially when it comes to experts in the complex field of cybersecurity.  Carriers who already are experienced (either by themselves or with partners) in protecting their infrastructure and offering services to small and medium business can benefit from new revenue streams by offering security solutions to the healthcare sector.\nA Prime Opportunity for the Service Provider – How to get started with MSSP\nThere are three major ways a Service Provider can get into the business of selling an MSSP service:\n\nWhite label an existing service. This is the least risky of the options, and requires no upfront capital. It’s also the fastest way to bring a service to the market. The carrier gets to focus on sales, marketing, and back-office support, but delegates the security expertise and the technology to a partner. This can be sold as a part of connectivity or compute/storage services as part of a high-value bundle.\nBuild your own service. This takes the most time, capital, and resources, but also offers the highest margins and overall NPV. If you have an in-house IT team that can operate and manage a network security solution, you can maximize your return on investment.\nGet the best of both worlds. A third option is to start with a white-labeled service before transitioning to managing it in-house. You forego large capital expenditures up front so you can focus on marketing and selling the service while building back-office operations and expertise. You’ll be able to quickly serve customers and gauge enthusiasm while planning to migrate operations in house over time to recognize the large profit streams in the later years.\n\nThis is the third in a series of papers from Radware on the topic of the Compelling ROI for Service Providers offering Security Services.\nPart 1: Could Your Local Car Dealer, Bank or Doctor’s Office be Next?\nPart 2: Small and Medium Businesses in the Spotlight for Hackers\n\n\nRead “Cyber Economics: Validating DDoS Managed Service Delivery Models” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'carrier\', \'Healthcare\', \'Service Provider\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/healthcare-cyber-threat/');

They are sending attacks inside the security protocols that are designed to protect the application.\nSecrecy is a two-way street\nOrganizations use secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt their internet communications. The encryption protocols are utilized to ensure privacy and ensure data integrity. Unfortunately, the encryption protocols secure all application data, whether it is legitimate or malicious.\nHackers are using the SSL/TLS protocols as a tool to obfuscate their attack payloads. A security device may be able to identify a cross-site scripting or SQL injection attack in plaintext, but if the same attack is encrypted using SSL/TLS, the attack will go through unless it has been decrypted first for inspection.\nHackers have also been able to find vulnerabilities within the SSL/TLS protocol itself. As an internet protocol, SSL/TLS is vulnerable to bugs and exploits. Hackers have taken advantage of renegotiation flaws, the POODLE vulnerability, and Heartbleed to name a few.\n [You might also like: Outbound SSL Solutions Protect Assets in the Wild]\nDefending against your own security tool\nOrganizations are in a quandary, having to use SSL/TLS technologies to protect their applications, but also needing tools to protect against the same protocols because the hackers are using them against the business.\nPerimeter security defenses need to process SSL/TLS traffic and determine whether the connections are legitimate or part of a DDoS or application attack. Ideally, the system can manage the SSL/TLS traffic at a performance level that does not impact the network and application availability.\nBecause of the heavy resource requirements to manage encrypted SSL/TLS connections, the security solution must have a methodology to process and triage the connections. When necessary, the solution can offload the SSL/TLS connection to a high-performance encryption system that can perform a proper challenge/response to validate the SSL/TLS connection.\nIn addition, this encryption system can inspect and validate the content when necessary. The SSL inspection solution must be out-of-band to ensure that it does not become a bottleneck when the number of SSL connections increase.\nDefenseSSL for inbound protection\nInbound SSL inspection and mitigation solutions are an important and essential part of the perimeter DDoS mitigation and application security solutions.

They are focused on who has the valuable IP and how do they obtain it. In fact, according to the Verizon 2017 Data Breach report, 61% of victims last year were small and medium businesses. So not only are hackers not exclusively targeting large businesses, the opposite is true. More often than not, victims today are small and medium businesses.\nWhat hackers understand is that in our information-based economy, the amount of valuable data a business holds is independent of the number of employees. Data centers may have terabytes of valuable records but only dozens of employees to maintain the servers. Auto dealers are another good example of a business with few employees but many valuable records.\n [You might also like: Could Your Local Car Dealer, Bank or Doctor’s Office be Next?]\nThink about the last time you went to purchase a car. You handed over your driver’s license and auto insurance information, and if you were financing the car, which you probably were, you also gave financial information like annual wages, social security number, credit history, and bank account information. Plus, if you’ve been servicing your cars at the dealership, they also know the repair records and values of all your vehicles.\n\nAbout a year ago, I went to speak with a group of dealers about IT security and here is what I learned: The average dealership in the U.S. is typically a family business worth $4M USD. It typically has a first- or second-generation owner and about 12-14 employees, including not more than one IT person. So all of these sensitive records are swimming around inside this dealership and there is literally often only one person securing them. After I spoke about security, one of the dealer owners came up to me to tell me he didn’t get it. As he put it, “I care about three things: selling cars, making money and selling cars.” He said he couldn’t even tell me the name of this IT person and questioned why he should care. I asked him who founded the dealership that bore his family name.  “My father,” he said. What did he ultimately want to achieve with the business? “Give it to my son,” he said. So I asked him what would happen if the people of the town where he lived found that all their financial and bank account information had been stolen from the servers in his dealership. “My dealership reputation would be mud, I’d be ruined.” he said.  I explained, “that’s why you need to care.”\nMultiple articles have been written about how cyber criminals see auto dealers as great targets, information-rich businesses that are lightly defended.\nIn fact, major breaches in auto dealerships have already occurred. Last year, a shared database containing social security numbers and dealership employees’ information from 128 dealerships was found unsecured online.\nIn all of this, there is a solution. Nearly every dealership is connected to the internet via a service provider and consumes information services via cloud providers. These businesses are in a fortunate position to already be trusted by the auto dealership and many other small businesses with much greater resources to secure sensitive information. In fact, based on our recent survey of global enterprises, 30+% said that they want to purchase security services from their service provider, and the number was even higher, almost 40% for Europe.\n [You might also like: The Money Behind DDoS Managed Security Services]\nRecently, Radware worked with industry analysts at Heavy Reading to demonstrate the business case associated with service providers offering DDoS managed security services. Based on conservative assumptions over a 5-year period, we found that a DDoS managed security service could generate $460M in revenue and $317M in net cash with 74% margins in the outer years. You can download the paper here.\nEvidence is growing daily that hackers are primarily focusing on small and medium businesses that have valuable records and are typically lightly defended, if at all. Service providers are well-positioned to provide this service, as 30% of businesses are currently asking their service or cloud provider to offer a managed security service. Lastly, independent analysis by analyst firm Heavy Reading demonstrates that this is a $400+M million-dollar opportunity with impressive margins and cash flow.\nIt’s time for the service providers to give small and medium businesses the security services they desperately need, and enable them to focus on their core business. Protect the auto dealerships’ customers and let the dealer owner focus on what he does best: Selling cars, making money and selling cars.\n\n\nRead “Cyber Economics: Validating DDoS Managed Service Delivery Models” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'automobiles\', \'managed services\', \'Service Provider\', \'small business\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/small-medium-businesses-hackers-targets/');

Since then users around the world have flocked to these sites in search of drugs and other illicit services. Due to the high demand and availability for these items many marketplaces began to spring up across the Darknet. Most of these marketplaces feature drugs, but after the Silk Road takedown, marketplaces began offering items Silk Road wouldn’t allow. These items included weapons, credit cards and other malicious services like malware, DDoS-as-a-service and data dumps.\n\n\nToday, there is an estimated 2 million daily users on the Tor network alone. This popularity is largely due to the amount of funding and academic review that the network has received over the years. Accessing the Onion network is also extremely easy and does not require an expert’s knowledge. The same goes for hosting and running a hidden service on the Onion network. But with this ease of access comes real life consequences. Many people look to the Onion network for anonymity and obfuscation. They use these tools so they can carry out their activities with little to no trace. But this is not always the case. Criminals are humans too and they are prone to mistakes just like an average user. \nSo far, 2017 has been an eventful year for the Onion network. Raids and takedowns have become common on the Dark web as federal agents across the world step up enforcement. In parallel, market operators and vendors are not only targeted by law enforcement but they are also being targeted by competition, rogue users, vigilantes and extortionists looking to profit by exposing the administrators’ personal details and vulnerabilities in their marketplace. \nFreedom Hosting 2 takedown\nAt the beginning of February this year, a vigilante hacker took down over 10,000 hidden services, a fifth of the Onion network, that was running on Freedom Hosting 2. Freedom Hosting 2 was one of the largest Dark web hosting providers and a hacker discovered that it was hosting child pornography. The hacker not only took the hosting provider offline but also leaked the databases and private keys in a public dump.\n [You might also like: Darknet 101: An Introduction to The Darkest Places Online]\nFreedom Hosting 1 had a similar issue in 2013 when law enforcement took over the network due to child pornography. Agents at the time had deployed a network investigation technique using a piece of malware designed to obtain a user’s real IP address. Normally law enforcement does not immediately take down a marketplace. Agents normally seize and take control of Darkweb sites or hosting providers so they can identify more users and build a bigger case.\nThis is exactly what we saw in the global takedown of the Hansa and AlphaBay marketplaces.  On July 20th Hansa was shut down following the takedown of AlphaBay on July 4th. During a press interview on July 20th it became known that Hansa was originally taken over on June 20th but law enforcement officials did not immediately take the market offline. Instead they operated Hansa for several weeks, quietly collecting login user names, passwords and activities of the users and vendors.\nAlphaBay\nAt the same time, agents around the world worked on compromising AlphaBay and on July 4th the marketplace went offline. The trap was set. Users and vendors began frantically searching for a new marketplace, and in the process used Clearnet sites like Reddit to advertise their new markets. Vendors and buyers quickly began moving to Hansa as suspected, which was under control by law enforcement at the time. \nHansa\nAgencies around the world worked together to make this possible. The intel gathered from such an operation gave law enforcement a deeper insight into the threat landscape. Agents were able to capture credentials and monitor activity. During the Department of Justice’s press release, Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, said that the Darknet is not a place to hide. He is correct. The Darknet is not a silver bullet for keeping you out of jail. It’s simply a tool used in a series to help protect your identity. But at the end of the day, humans are still susceptible to error and the marketplaces were ultimately taken down due to failures in personnel and operational security. \n [You might also like: Cyber Attack Market Place]\nAs a result of these failures, the largest Darknet marketplace in history was taken down. Shortly after his arrest, the alleged founder was found dead in his jail cell in Thailand. Currently the alleged founder of Silk Road is serving a life sentence in the United States for computer hacking, laundering and the conspiracy to traffic narcotics and fraudulent identities.  It was reported that AlphaBay was ten times larger than Silk Road and generated a billion dollars in sales in its three-year history. AlphaBay at the time of its takedown had over 200,000 users and 40,000 vendors selling everything from drugs to attack services. AlphaBay’s forum was also a hotbed of illicit activity involving users buying and selling leaked databases and stolen credit cards. \nThese kind of takedowns are digital perp walks meant to generate media attention. They are also designed to send a message to the community that agencies are paying attention to a verified problem. It also shows how active these agencies are in targeting the marketplaces themselves. In my opinion these takedowns are great for a number of reasons on the surface, but what is the end result? Unfortunately, this is only going to motivate vendors and operators to evolve through trial and error, making marketplace and forums harder to gain access to. \nOld Forum – GroundZero\nMarketplaces will soon begin incorporating trust tests seen in the previous version of GroundZero, a Darknet hacking forum.  To gain membership on this forum, you were required to target a site and send the site’s credentials to the administrators of GroundZero. Once the hack was verified, the user was granted access. This technique is similar to mafia trust tests and will slowly edge researchers out as they become more widely adopted by marketplaces and forums on the Darknet.  \nVendors and operators are going long because business is profitable and within an acceptable level of risk for them. They are looking to evolve these hidden services into becoming secure and resilient to takedowns. They are also looking for ways to prevent researchers and law enforcement agencies from entering their marketplaces in the future.\nIn the end, another Darknet marketplace will rise to the top and become bigger than AlphaBay. And again, in the future this marketplace will also be taken down. Someone is always going to rebuild when there is this much money on the table. They will evolve through trial and error until someone figures out a temporary recipe for success, but they too will be targeted. Not only by law enforcement and researchers but also by criminal hackers looking to extort administrators.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Alphabay\', \'Dark web\', \'Darknet\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/dark-web-evolution/');

Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nInformation Security Challenges of Financial Institutions\nData Protection\nAccording to Radwareâs latest Application and Network Security Report, protecting sensitive data was the top concern for organizations. Financial institutions guard a large variety of sensitive information â PII, account credentials, and credit cards, but also market predictions, interest analysis, investment portfolios and much more. Sensitive data is highly valuable in the Dark markets, where there is a prospering trade in such records. Thus, data is lucrative for both businesses and hackers. These hackers build sophisticated programs to evade protection mechanisms and get ahold of sensitive information. From a defenderâs point of view, a clear distinction needs to be made between bot and human activity (using baselines and behavioral analysis) as well as interception of communication with Command and Control (C&C) servers.\nMobile Banking\nHow do you maintain an easy and user-friendly experience in the most secure way? Letâs be honest with ourselves. How many businesses secure their mobile applications as much as they protect their network or web-based services and applications? What about all the APIs these applications use? Now think of mobile banking â the complexity becomes larger. Many smartphones are vulnerable to all sorts of malware and sensitive information (even usernames and passwords) might be exposed to data harvesting tools. In addition, the mobile application usually interacts via APIs with social media, location and other applications that are installed on the device.\nThe SSL Challenge\nThe obvious answer would be to use encrypted data. Indeed, many websites and businesses today go towards 100% SSL/TLS communications. However, it requires quite a large investment in hardware upgrades as processing encrypted traffic requires a lot more computing resources. While new ciphers may result in high latency and challenge legacy systems, old ciphers are insecure. It is important that businesses understand that just SSL is not a replacement for security but it has to be monitored as well, as there are many SSL-based application and DoS attacks (like floods or key renegotiation).

If such institutions fail an audit or worse â get breached, they will have to carry very high costs for not securing their system properly (up to $4 of the total annual revenue according to the upcoming enforcement of GDPR in May 2018). So while the cost for hackers to launch an attack (a handful of U.S. dollars is the current street price for a simple Cyber-Attack-as-a-Service tool on the Darknet). It is a challenge for both financial institutions and regulators to follow the rapid evolution of adapting agile and efficient methodologies of information-sharing and cross-platform integration in order to be able to think of all risks and provide guidance.\nHere are a few thoughts on how to significantly reduce the attack surface and reduce costs associated with cyber-attacks (the five âEâs):\n\nEncryption – TLS is required to secure the communications between the client and APIs for transport confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.\nEmployee education â To prevent insider threats and specifically BEC (Business Email Comopromise), make sure employees comply with internal and industry regulations and are attentive to suspicious emails and communications, and handle data with care.\nExchange of information â Integrating 3rd party application services must not pass along any sensitive information if thereâs no clarity on what happens next. Just as well â it is important to challenge incoming data streams and filter possible injections, exploitations and contamination attempts.\nEntity access to data â Strong authorization and multi-factor authentication mechanisms are to be applied on HTTP requestsâ behavior.

For C-suite executives around the world, striking a balance between safeguarding their organization’s data and meeting government regulations without adversely affecting day-to-day operations has always been a careful balancing act.\n\nIn light of recent high-profile cyber-attacks in 2016 and 2017 and changing government policies regarding data privacy and security, Radware wanted to gauge executives’ views on privacy – both as individual consumers and as business leaders. To find out, Radware surveyed over 200 IT executives throughout the United States and Europe. This article provides an overview of the key findings from Radware’s Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite report.\n\nOverall, while most respondents agree that privacy is compromised by current laws and legislation related to information security, 80% feel the government should do more to protect personal information. That is true whether they were responding as business leaders or as individual citizens – and regardless of their home country.\nEurope: Committed to Privacy?\nSince the mid-1990s, legislation that protects the information privacy of individuals in the EU is primarily based on EU Directive 95/46/EC: the Data Protection Directive. This legislative act set out minimum standards on data protection—offering guiding principles without specific instructions or harsh penalties for non-compliance. Each country within the EU has taken Directive 95/46/EC and transposed it into its own, local data protection laws.\nFigure 1. Is privacy compromised by current laws?\nIn January 2012, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the data protection rules in the EU. Known as GDPR, it is the largest reform in data protection law in the past 20 years. The goal: to return control over personal data to EU citizens and simplify the regulatory environment for business through greater cross-EU consistency.\n [You might also like: How Do You Create a Flight Plan to a Never-Ending Journey?]\nSlated to take effect on May 25, 2018, GDPR aims to provide protection concerning the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. It represents an entirely new set of regulatory rules and measures to comply with and implement by any organization that controls or processes any form of personal data. Under the GDPR, “personal data” is to be interpreted in the wide sense of the term—and pertains to any information relating to an individual, whether his or her private, professional or public life. Personal data can include anything from a name, picture, email address, financial details, posts on social networks or even a computer’s IP address.\nNot abiding with the GDPR will be met with enforced action including fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the offending organization’s annual worldwide revenue when facing a breach of the data protection rules. The GDPR includes provisions that promote accountability and governance that can be audited with non-compliance, leading to administrative fines of up to €10 million (or 2% of annual worldwide revenue).\nWhenever a company wants to trade or do business with one or several of the EU member states, it will have to prove adequacy. In other words, virtually any company that does business in the EU will need data protection standards that are equivalent to the EU’s GDPR starting in May 2018. This virtually makes GDPR a global, worldwide regulation affecting organizations and businesses around the globe—and that is poised to have a huge impact on the competitiveness of US companies in EU markets.\nIn France, companies also face a specific law from 1978, Loi Informatique et Libertés, which strictly supervises the use of personal data and the consolidation/filing of extensive databases containing personal, private data. For German companies, the shift to the GDPR will likely be less traumatic, as national laws already mandate prompt and thorough reporting by any organization deemed part of “critical infrastructure.” For companies in the UK, the road may be a bit rockier as they face massive uncertainty related to Brexit. Initial signs seem to suggest that most companies will still work to meet GDPR requirements, as those will govern any data that large, UK-based companies may hold in other EU countries.\nUndoing New Protections in the U.S.\nAt the end of the last presidential administration, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a set of rules designed to increase protections for consumer privacy. As explained in an FCC news release, “The rules separate the use and sharing of information into three categories and include clear guidance for both ISPs and customers about the transparency, choice and security requirements for customers’ personal information.”\nOpt-in: ISPs are required to obtain affirmative ‘opt-in’ consent from consumers to use and share sensitive information. The rules specify categories of information that are considered sensitive, which include precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information, social security numbers, web browsing history, app usage history and the content of communications.\n [You might also like: Is the Internet Rolling Back our Freedoms?]\nOpt-out: ISPs would be allowed to use and share non-sensitive information unless a customer ‘opts-out.’ All other individually identifiable customer information – for example, email address or service tier information – would be considered non-sensitive and the use and sharing of that information would be subject to opt-out consent, consistent with consumer expectations.\nExceptions to consent requirements: Customer consent is inferred for certain purposes specified in the statute, including the provision of broadband service or billing and collection. For the use of this information, no additional customer consent is required beyond the creation of the customer-ISP relationship.”\nBefore the FCC could actually enact those rules, however, the then-newly elected presidential administration rolled them back—signaling the US’s shift away from Europe in terms of privacy laws. In a similar signal of deregulation, on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted to begin repealing what are commonly referred to as “net neutrality” laws. “[Net neutrality is] the idea that phone and cable companies should treat all of the traffic on their networks equally—no blocking or slowing their competitors, and no fast lanes for companies that can pay more,” as an NPR article succinctly explained.2 Enacted in 2015, these rules had placed ISPs under strict FCC oversight. Now it appears that the FCC will be taking a lighter touch in regulating phone and cable companies, potentially easing the regulatory burden for business but creating more privacy risks for consumers.\nThe Privacy Pendulum\nWhile the EU and, in all likelihood, the post-Brexit UK, are tightening the reins on consumer privacy protections, the U.S. appears to be headed in the opposite direction. How these competing forces will affect cyber security—and global competitiveness—remain to be seen.\nResults by Region\nIn Europe, 67% of executives agree that privacy is compromised by current privacy laws and legislation related to information security.\n\nIn the U.S., the finding was similar, with 66% indicating that current laws are putting privacy at risk and 75% looking to government to do more.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'c-suite\', \'GDPR\', \'privacy\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/c-suite-priorities-privacy-profit/');

The inefficient consumption, not to say waste, of energy to generate Proof of Work is pretty much orthogonal with the premise of IoT devices, which have to consume less energy and are in some cases battery powered. POW comes at a severe cost and it does not add much value to the use case of a distributed ledger used within a consortium of partners. Hence the implementation based on Proof of Stake provides a better starting point for any attempt to chainify an IoT ecosystem where a consortium of partners is adopting a new business application. The security would then be based on a limited number of centralized nodes or cloud servers and by design it does not rely on independence of central trust as do the public cryptocurrencies. Most blockchain use cases I came across start from the assumption that there is a set of parties or a consortium of partners that have a common interest in a specific ledger, and while it might serve the larger public in terms of better quality and faster service, the consumer is not directly concerned with or interested in the ledger itself, only the parties who provide the service and rely on the ledger for remuneration will be.\n\n\nA world of hashing\nIBM, in partnership with Samsung, unveiled a concept ADEPT or Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry that uses technology such as blockchains to create distributed networks of autonomous devices in a decentralized IoT ecosystem. As they introduce in their whitepaper, any protocol used by autonomous systems within the IoT ecosystem should be secured, authenticated and distributed, and the foundational communication functions which each node in the ecosystem should be able to perform in a distributed fashion are messaging, file sharing and coordination. As such, IBM and Samsung used three protocols for their concept: Bittorrent for file sharing, Ethereum for smart contracts, and Telehash for peer-to-peer messaging.\n [You might also like: Internet of Things or Internet of Threats?]\nThe first foundational function is obvious. IoT devices will typically interact with their environment through actuators or collect information of their environment from sensors. Whenever a change in the environment is sensed, a messaging system should provide a means to relay that information to other autonomous systems such as devices, servers or services. Such messaging must be distributed, secure and authenticated corresponding to the sensitivity of the information transported. Current IoT messaging systems, such as MQTT for example, use a central broker design and while they can be secured and authenticated, they will never provide the scale for millions or billions of devices without complex hierarchical designs. In the highly distributed, highly unreliable (I)IoT environments with low bandwidths, fluctuating latencies and regular disconnections, new peer to peer messaging systems are required which provide communication using encrypted messaging and transport, guaranteed delivery and store and forwarding of messages with ‘hop-on’ to other devices. Technology such as Distributed Hash Tables (DHT), used by the Bittorrent network, enables peers to search and find other peers in the network using a hash table of (key, value) pairs. Every peer generates and stores its own unique hashname in the DHT and uses the DHT to find peers to send and receive encrypted messages with in the network. Telehash is an open source messaging protocol based on a DHT implementation. Telehash provides distributed, secure messaging and routing through the Kademlia DHT implementation.\nDistributed File sharing between nodes in an IoT ecosystem could provide for the exchange of larger chunks of non-real-time information such as configurations, global policies, and firmware/software updates.  Bittorrent is well known as a robust and performant peer-to-peer file sharing protocol and its trackerless torrents are based on the same DHT implementation of the Kademlia protocol as Telehash.\nWhen there is a need for transactions in the IoT ecosystem, then blockchain is the technology which provides the decentralized ledger where autonomous nodes in the network can verify the validity of each transaction without relying on a central authority. Every node in the system keeps a complete history of all the transactions performed in the whole ecosystem. Because of its distributed nature the ledger is tamper-proof, robust and not prone to man-in-the-middle attacks. Using blockchain, IoT devices become true autonomous smart devices which perform payments, agreements with other autonomous systems in the same ecosystem such as providing resources in return for certain services, provide history and support entitlements throughout the whole ecosystem without requiring a central entitlement server or service. Imagine smart devices part of a larger IoT ecosystem being able to place orders for repairing other parts of the ecosystem, using the blockchain for proof of support entitlement or paying directly with a global pools of tokens for replacement parts or interventions: a self-sustaining, self-supported, self-maintaining smart ecosystem that does not require any human intervention to operate and maintain. Blockchain as a technology is able to provide any functionality that requires a trusted ledger of transactions, which can also include events for compliance and regulatory management of Industrial IoT applications.\nThe ADEPT PoC successfully demonstrated four use cases using functional Samsung products:\n\nA W9000 Samsung washer autonomously reordering detergent (B2C)\nA W9000 Samsung washer autonomously reordering service parts (B2C)\nA W9000 Samsung washer autonomously negotiating power usage (B2C)\nSamsung Large Format Displays (LFDs) autonomously displaying advertising content (B2B)\n\n“By empowering devices to engage autonomously in markets – both financial and nonfinancial – and react to changes in markets, the IoT will create an ‘Economy of Things’. Virtually every device and system can potentially become a point of transaction and economic value creation for owners and users. These capabilities will be crucial to everything from enabling sharing economies to energy efficiency and distributed storage.”\nThe ADEPT whitepaper cited that certain issues, including scalability and the nature of cryptocurrency development today, are potential challenges should the concept ever be applied on a grander scale. They address the issue of network scalability within the context of a distributed IoT, and according to the authors, there are no clear paths forward to scale the system as-is to incorporate billions of devices, but work in this area is promising. As they cite in the paper: “Multiple efforts like sidechains, treechains, and mini-blockchains are ongoing to address this problem. While each approach has its merits and demerits we are yet to see consensus on a common approach across the board. A blockchain to cater to hundreds of billions of devices needs to be scalable.” Also notable is the distinction of three broad categories of devices. Depending on their computing and storage capabilities, devices can be light peers which retain a light wallet with their blockchain addresses and balances, and perform minimal file sharing. To obtain its blockchain transactions, a light peer will turn to a trusted peer. The authors start from the assumption that in the next few years the cost of general-purpose computing will decline and more manufacturers will turn to devices with increased computing power and storage to create the ‘standard peers’ of the concept. A standard peer retains a part of the blockchain, based on its capabilities. The third category of devices, the ‘peer exchanges’ are high-end devices with vast computing and storage capabilities. These (cloud server) peers are owned and operated by the organizations and host the marketplace components such as analytics, payment exchanges, trade, legal compliance solutions, …. and are capable of interoperating and interacting with other business solutions. The peer exchanges are also the (only) repositories retaining a complete copy of the blockchain.\n [You might also like: From BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks.]\nHigh-profile, high-reward targets for hackers\nWhile public cryptocurrencies provide inherent resistance against traditional DDoS attacks, interfaces have to be formed between blockchain systems and third party services, between the systems and its users. Those interfaces will most conveniently be solved by providing web APIs and/or web applications, reaching back to the centrally brokered cloud solutions. Even if the technology behind the service is highly distributed and resistant to DDoS attacks, the entry-points and bridges between the ecosystems will represent high-profile, high-reward targets for hackers. Consider the recent DDoS attacks on the Bitfinex and BTC-e Bitcoin exchanges. The DDoS attacks were targeting and impacting the web service of the exchanges, not the blockchain nodes. There are also recent examples of hackers compromising these service points by stealing cryptocurrencies through redirecting web domains. such as here. Again, not exploiting vulnerabilities of the blockchain but the entry-point or service-point which provides end-users convenient access to the backend blockchain.\nVulnerabilities ahead\nUntil now we considered the blockchain to be perfect and not vulnerable to attacks, and while the algorithm might not be flawed, the implementation or the application (such as a smart contract) on top of the blockchain could be. Ethereum provides a programming language embedded in the blockchain to enable smart contracts and applications on top of the blockchain. On June 17th, 2016 a hacker used a weakness in the DAO code (a smart contract written on top of Ethereum blockchain) to drain 3.6 million ETH ($53m), essentially a third of the fund, into his account, within just a few hours.\nIn July 2015, Bitcoin activated the BIP66 soft fork. Pieter Wuille then disclosed that BIP66 fixed a consensus bug in OpenSSL that could cause a chainfork. Since many sidechains, including Namecoin, were based on Bitcoin and hadn’t yet activated BIP66 at the time of disclosure, this resulted in a serious 0day opportunity on the sidechains.\nHajime – the first distributed, multi-platform IoT software in production\nRemember the IoT botnet malware? The botnet is estimated at a whopping 300,000 compromised IoT devices that communicate through a distributed peer-to-peer trackerless Bittorrent network, leveraging DHTs and using rotating info_hashes with RC4 public/private key for authenticating and encrypting communications. Hajime has support for a large range of IoT platforms based on arm5, arm6, arm7, mipseb and mipsel architectures. It provides automatic silent updates and modularity through extension modules. It even solved the distribution problem as it proliferates through common IoT vulnerabilities and exploits and aims at securing the devices from further compromise by IoT botnets – except for BrickerBot which aims its crosshairs at any infected IoT devices in an attempt to brick them.\nThe only feature Hajime is missing today is a blockchain implementation, which could bring new business applications to the botnet through a proper payment system for victimized devices and owners that could get ransomed by it… Joking… I hope….\nAs the future for scalable IoT is moving into autonomous, decentralized systems, providing new applications through Blockchain and growing into an Economy of Things, we all need to keep our mindset on security first. If we want to make the Economy of Things a profitable reality, our first priority should go to improving the overall state of security of all things connected, new and existing.\nSources:\nhttps://www.infoq.com/presentations/namecoin-monero\nhttps://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/iot-blockchain-use-cases/\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\nhttps://namecoin.org/\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-proof-of-work\nhttps://keepingstock.net/explaining-blockchain-how-proof-of-work-enables-trustless-consensus-2abed27f0845\nhttps://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/GBE03662USEN.pdf\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'Blockchain\', \'Hackers\', \'Hajime\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/blockchain-iot-part-3/');

In order to create a blockchain shared between autonomous devices that fulfills the security properties required to ensure operation of the ecosystem, the ‘good’ devices need to accumulate a minimum 51% share of the compute power in the system. To put this requirement in perspective, consider a Raspberry PI version 3, which represents a fairly well equipped IoT device in terms of memory, storage capacity and CPU power – know that most of the current IoT devices are far behind in terms of their computing capabilities. A RPi3 is able to generate about 10 hashes per second for the Ethereum POW. Your kid’s gaming rig, equipped with an Nvidia GTX1070 GPU, is able to perform this task at a rate of 25.1 million hashes per second. Meaning that in general, to have the same probability of completing the Proof of Work before any hacker with a modern day PC, the system needs to be composed of at least 2.5 million RPi3 devices. Or to put it differently, any IoT system using the same distributed trustless consensus paradigm used by Bitcoin needs to be larger than 2.5 million devices before it could be deemed secure from DoS and reverse attacks by individuals. This is not even taking into account government-sponsored or organized crime hackers as they have access to far more powerful systems, or people who have purposefully built hardware based on FPGAs typically used to efficiently mine Bitcoins.\n\nAnother consideration for enabling IoT devices as full nodes in a Blockchain is the storage requirement. Depending on the number of transactions and the size of each transaction in the ledger, the storage requirements will be growing faster than linear as nodes get added to the blockchain. A Bitcoin Core client, for example, requires more than 100GB of storage for downloading the blockchain and that is a real deal breaker for the limited bandwidth and limited storage devices that make up most of the IoT systems.\nConsidering this, I would argue that a blockchain based on Bitcoin technology, or more generally spoken based on Proof of Work for implementing trustless consensus, will not be able to provide the required levels of security with current gen IoT systems, at least not in a fully distributed and autonomous way. Solutions present themselves in terms of adding centralized cloud servers and cloud storage to accommodate the compute power and storage needs of the blockchain, and as such, reverting back to a more centralized solution while IoT devices become light clients such as proposed in the light client protocol for Ethereum.\n\nHard and Soft Forks\nVulnerabilities are a fact of digital life. A hard fork on a blockchain is a software upgrade that introduces new consensus rules that aren’t compatible with the older software. New consensus rules can be required to fix vulnerabilities, extend the capabilities or add new functionality. Consider a new rule to allow a block size of 4kB instead of the previous 2kB block size. In a distributed system, not all nodes will be upgraded at the same time and at some point there will be a critical amount of nodes running the new software and another amount in the old software. Because blocks generated in the upgraded nodes are 4kB, they will not be validated by nodes running old software. At that point the blockchain will break into two chains that will start an independent life. For cryptocurrencies, the entity in charge of the blockchain software will have to agree with the majority of the miners to upgrade to the new software and hope other miners follow their lead. If there is no incentive for miners or no human relation to leverage, the hard fork could result in a split. If the majority of the miners agree to upgrade however, the others will be stuck on a chain that is split off from the main blockchain and will start to lose incentive. The economics of the blockchain currency will push the miners back to the new chain through upgrading to the newest software, until the next hard fork. There might be a conflict of interest between two2 major stakeholders in the blockchain. While one wants to go in a certain direction, the other wants to stay and has other plans for the future. This might result in a permanent hard fork where two separate blockchains continue their independent lives. This is what happened to Ethereum in July 2016 when it split in two separate chains and currencies: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, both of which have different currency and ethos.\n [You might also like: How To Buy Bitcoin]\nA soft fork happens when there is a backwards compatible change in the software. Continuing on our previous example, imagine a new rule allows a block size of max 1kB while the previous rule supported 2kB block sizes. Non-upgraded nodes will accept blocks from the newer versions as they respect the consensus rules, however any new blocks mined by non-upgraded nodes will be refused by the newer version nodes and as the number of new software nodes increases, the older version miners will not be rewarded for new blocks and will be incentivized to upgrade in order to profit again.\nUpgrading software and breaking backwards compatibility is fairly delicate, but without innovation becomes inhibited. In a blockchain environment where one needs to convince third parties to prevent the system from splintering, breaking backwards compatibility became even more delicate. Most of the convincing in blockchain is based on economics: the incentives are driving miners to follow the lead and vision of the blockchain developers.\nMerge-Mined Sidechains – piggy-backing on established blockchains\nDifferent blockchains are emerging, each of them solving different problems, providing less or more flexibility and extensibility, and some of them are public while others are kept private. It is clear that there will not be one blockchain that will cover all use cases and solve all our distributed problems. Bitcoin is the godfather of all blockchains and still today is considered the most secure and most mature, while having the highest commerce volume, the most developers, the highest market cap, the most code review, the highest mining hash-rate and the most academic analysis. So why not leverage the existing Bitcoin blockchain for new applications? It would help a great deal of new applications, because the idea of distributed trustless consensus and the proof-of-work requires a 51% share in computing power to secure its ecosystem against attacks. Piggy-backing on the oldest existing, most elaborate, established blockchain such as Bitcoin seems like the great idea for new and innovative applications.\nTechnically spoken, the Bitcoin blockchain can accommodate for any data, not only currency transactions. This was the initial idea behind the BitDNS proposal: a project to extend Bitcoin’s technology to a domain name service, expanding the software to support transactions for registering, updating, and transferring domains. The proposal was released by Vincent Durham, a pseudonymous author who later disappeared – much like Satoshi. The project eventually became an altchain with its own altcoin, known as Namecoin. The reason BitDNS morphed into an altchain project was because Satohsi Nakamoto objected to this idea, based on the paradigm that Bitcoin is a social contract: users agree to pay the cost to store the Bitcoin blockchain and in return they get to use the currency that results from it for free. If Bitcoin users will have to store non-currency data such as DNS information, that would violate the social contract. Satoshi did however propose a modified Proof of Work system that would allow miners to mine Bitcoin, BitDNS, and any other ‘BitX’ blocks that might come later, without performance loss. This idea, called Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW), allows an auxiliary blockchain to accept Auxiliary Proof of Work from one blockchain as their own Proof of Work. Satoshi argued that this would allow multiple blockchains to co-exist without being a danger to each other if many chains’ miners ganged up on one chain. This proposal resulted in a merged-mining specification and merged-mined sidechains such as Namecoin.\nMerge-mining incentivizes miners by providing them not only the reward of the main currency but also the sidechain’s currency with little extra effort, again an idea driven by the economics of the system. For the sidechain developers however, it means that they need to provide a version of software that is interoperable with the main chain, e.g. Bitcoin, and their own chain (the sidechain). This severely impacts and limits the developers of the sidechain as they are completely dependent on the advances on the main chain. When Bitcoin does a hard fork, for example, all sidechains need to provide a new version of their software that is compatible with the new Bitcoin core client or they risk losing the miners that accepted to run their version of software. So, while merge-mined sidechains provide the additional security through a critical share of compute power (securing and protecting them through the economics that an attack will be too expensive to perform), they will have to follow closely any changes in direction of the blockchain they are merge-mined with, even if they do not agree or see the incentive of doing so.\n [You might also like: The Current Surge of Bitcoin Prices]\nProof of Stake\nEven if the theory is still catching up and the system works better in reality than on paper, Bitcoin has proven that Proof of Work provides the ability to reach consensus in a distributed system as clients simply pick the longest valid chain, which corresponds to the highest amount of work, as the correct chain. Proof of Work however is very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, one of the economic foundations it is based upon to secure the chain from malicious nodes in the trustless system. A property that also led miners to centralize their hashing power, which obviously is not in line with the spirit of a network whose intent was to minimize the dependence on few trusted parties.\nProof of Stake (POS) is not about mining but about validating. With proof of stake, every participant in the network gets awarded an amount of shares, and depending on the amount, their probability of being allowed to add the next block on the chain will be higher or lower. In POS blockchains the blocks are said to be ‘minted’ rather than ‘mined.’ Minting of blocks does not reap any rewards, hence in POS based cryptocurrencies the total number of coins typically does not change over time like it does in POW based cryptocurrencies.\nProof of Stake is non-trivial for public blockchain implementations, but is supposed to be useable as a consensus algorithm in private and consortium chain settings. Ethereum (ETH), one of the most trusted and experimented blockchains by enterprises, is preparing to move to the Proof of Stake model by the end of 2017. The expert’s opinions are differing though as some claim that Proof of Stake will never be able to provide the same level of security as is provided through Proof of Work and its inherent economic impact on the attack.\nStay tuned for Part 3 of our series tomorrow.\n\n\nDownload “When the Bots Come Marching In, a Closer Look at Evolving Threats from Botnets, Web Scraping & IoT Zombies” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'Blockchain\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/08/blockchain-iot-part-2/');

One way to look at it is on-demand service vs. an always-on service.  The on-demand model monitors specific data streams during specified times.  This would appeal to smaller organizations that don’t feel the need for continuous DDoS protection.  The always-on option would be attractive to larger enterprises that house sensitive data, like financial or medical records.  In order to determine the best model, probe your customer to determine their true needs.  Is their data critical or proprietary?  Does your customer need something that runs in the background all the time?  Will their budget cover 24/7 support?\n [You might also like: Enterprises are asking for help to protect their data.

It is also no secret that there are more threats and more solutions to stay on top of. While it makes me wonder if we are reaching the limit of the capabilities of the human mind when it gets to efficient information analysis for proper decision-making, I am quite certain we can agree that as far as information security professionals go, we are definitely getting to that point, subject to day-to-day constraints.\n\nIn the ever-evolving search for the more precise, more efficient operation, we break up the information units (whether these are consuming, storing or processing units) to perform more specific activities.\n\nThis way, many services today run thanks to a set of functions that are consumed individually and use APIs to synchronize. This way, business operations are delivered more efficiently, and are being put together much faster as the flexibility and scalability of API utilization make the architecture simpler.\nHowever, as many APIs are mission critical and involve major functionalities and business processes, APIs introduce a wide range of risks and vulnerabilities. The combination of growing adoption and security risks was the major driver for the inclusion of under-protected APIs to the 2017 OWASP top 10 list.\nSo on one hand, we have a great advantage to the modern DevOps environment that is constantly under the pressure of continuous delivery (to maintain the service optimally at all times), and on the other hand a security challenge. You can’t avoid APIs – to be as elastic and resilient as possible, there is no choice but a complete-process automation starting with provisioning and management, to platform management applications, to the staging and production environment where the service runs.\n [You might also like: Agile, DevOps and Load Balancers: Evolution of Network Operations]\nRapid FaaS evolution is driving API adoption\nWhen functions are consumed to form an operational unit that is a set of function containers rather than a web server, we are talking on a new architecture which is being referred to as “Serverless.” These functions are actually APIs exposed for the client side application, which may invoke these APIs upon relevant client side event. That yields in a greater complexity compared to using virtual machines, because the containers are on a ‘need’ basis – they are created and demolished to perform a certain role when required only, and then go extinct, allowing efficiency and cost savings.\nThe API Security Challenge\nIt also grounds for trouble. Traditional application security assessment tools used for scanning and testing will not invoke the API because they cannot generate the request properly or provide the right data in many cases (even if it knows whether to use JSON or XML).\nIn a typical API, third-party frameworks and libraries use custom methods to read a JSON or XML document from the HTTP request and pass it over to the API code for handling. These methods are subject to constant changes, limiting the success rate of such tools.\nRisks:\nThe risks within APIs are not essentially different from any other application, and can be categorized by various methods of authentication, injections, misconfigurations and data encryption.\nThe focus should be on the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit but not solely that. Attackers can violate access permissions and hijack the session to eventually trick an API (or the service that consumes it) to perform a series of unwanted actions like leaking sensitive data, for instance. Protocol evasion techniques (HTTP Null byte, TCP packet reordering and more) or manipulations of the JSON/XML parameters (like large element values), as well as bot activity (brute force, scraping or even DDoS) against the API are major concerns to pay attention to.\nWhen using a Web Application Firewall, it is recommended to see if it implies the same security on APIs as well as it does on regular web applications. Access restrictions, XML/JSON schema validation, limiting identical attempts, guarding data and keys, message size policy etc. should be implemented and monitored.\nGenerally, combining a positive and negative security model will provide a robust protection to the API infrastructure. Knowing the normal behavior of the API as well as bad behavior patterns will lead to a more secured environment with an extremely low rate of false positives, thus facilitating continuous delivery.\n\nRead “Creating a Safe Environment for Under-Protected APIs” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'API\', \'API security\', \'OWASP\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/security-apis-continuous-delivery/');

Clients are sent to different pools of servers based on the uniform resource identifier (URI), cookies, or other types of content in the client request.\nContent on the Internet and within many private networks is encrypted. Over 50% of the traffic on the Internet is encrypted and that number continues to grow.

This function, known as SSL offload, is designed to allow the ADC to manage the encryption overhead for these secure applications in an efficient and easy to manage manner.\n [You might also like: The World is Changing]\nTo decrypt the content and make load balancing decisions, the ADC needs to have a copy of the encryption keys associated with the application.

For the industry, large-scale DDoS attacks can result in network outages or service degradation and has become an everyday occurrence. In 2016 Lizard Squad and Poodle Corp launched repeated attacks against EA, Blizzard and Riot Games, resulting in service degradation and outages for users around the world.\n\nThe main motivation for attackers in most situations is the simple thrill of disrupting game play and tournaments. A secondary motivation is disrupting crucial moments when gamers are trying to take advantage of new expansion packs or in-game specials.\n\nAttackers targeting the gaming industry can range from users who pay for DDoS services to experienced attackers who possess the ability to launch large scale spoofed attacks. Experienced attackers are able to sustain high volumes of attack traffic. The advanced attackers are also able to consistently change attack vectors in an attempt to defeat mitigation systems.  These vectors often include SYN floods, ACK floods, TCP reset attacks, UDP floods and fragmented UDP floods. The determination and systematic targeting of these services show how motivated attackers can be to knock a game offline.\n [You might also like: SMB Vulnerabilities â WannaCry, Adylkuzz and SambaCry]\nOver the last month several gaming companies have been dealing with a series of Denial of Service attacks. Final Fantasy XIV specifically has been dealing with an advanced and persistent denial of service attack that has included changing attack vectors. These attacks that have flooded Square Enixâs networks resulted in intermittent service degradation and disconnection for over a month. Square Enix in a recent statement confirmed that they have experienced a series of attacks from a third party since mid-June. The attacks appear to have started in parallel with the release of the second expansion pack, Stormblood, for Final Fantasy XIV on June 16th. These attacks have now transferred from targeting Square Enixâs game servers to their upstream providers. \nDDoS attacks and natural floods on the gaming industry also have an impact on network providers who must deal with potential Internet pipe saturation.  As attacks continue to increase in quantity and volume they will not only pose a threat to the gaming operators, but also effect network providers who have to absorb these massive floods of traffic.  \nOne of the biggest challenges for mitigating a DDoS attack against gaming platforms is distinguishing the difference between legitimate and malicious users. Attackers will often launch DDoS attacks during the release of a new title due to an increased load on the network. False positives and false negatives at moments like this can create major problems for gamers and providers. If a gamerâs traffic is falsely identified as malicious, it results in a loss of connectivity for that user. If the traffic is malicious and deemed legitimate, it allows the user to continue carrying out their attack.\nOnly advanced anti-DDoS solutions can successfully distinguish the difference between malicious traffic and legitimate users. An advanced anti-DDoS solution that includes behavioral analysis and challenge responses allow users to access gaming content during an attack. With a behavioral analysis algorithm, a baseline of application behavior can be established so when an attack is launched the traffic can be compare to the baseline allowing the system to detect and drop suspicious traffic. When looking for a solution, organizations should look for one that can accurately detect attacks in a very short timeframe without denying legitimate users access to network resources. \nIn addition, a challenge response (C/R) mechanisms can also help prevent malicious traffic from targeting networks. If the source is suspected to be suspicious, a challenge will be presented to the source so it can be determined if the request was legitimate. \nOrganizations should reevaluate todayâs DDoS protection systems, and more specifically, solutions that rely on traditional, rate-based detection methods. \n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'Denial of Service\', \'Gaming\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/gaming-legitimate-vs-malicious-users/');

U.S. banks and financial institutions around the world have come under cyber-attacks at a high rate. We’ve seen everything fromÂ DDoS attacks to waves of ransomware.Â \nSo, why was this? Is it because they didnât have enough resources or serious professionals dedicated to program management?Â  Not likely. The true answer is a bit more uncomfortable, but worthy of exploration.\n\nThe true reason is that attack mitigation is not a core competency of modern day security programs.\nFor example: Have you, Mr. or Mrs. Security Professional, ever tested your environment for a cyber attack?Â  Do you know how to mitigate these animals (no these are not modern-day Pen Tests, which donât test âservice disrupting techniquesâ)?\nDoes this question seem strange?

Ah, that question is easier to answer, more comfortable.\nOk (humor me a little longer), suppose we now asked, what tools and technology do you leverage to mitigate todayâs threats? Oh, this one is easy.\nHmmm, have you noticed that todayâs risks are not about individual threats or single vulnerabilities, but rather a cacophony of trialed threat and exploit vectors – – something we term as an âattack?â\nSo, given the fact that the cyber security world has changed over the past two years to an attack-based model which has its own new attributes, have you changed to adapt your control infrastructure to these new techniques?\n [You might also like: How to Prepare for the Biggest Change in IT Security in 10 Years: The Availability Threat]\nSo, hereâs the call to action: itâs high time we begin the process of not only dealing with individual vulnerabilities, but also diving deep into popular attack types, schemes, and tools (e.g. platforms) so that we might be able to prepare ourselves with better and more competent responses. Yes, attacks are unique and represent a new entrant in the dealings of information security programs. So, let me explain this concept deeper via the picture below. As you notice, if we just take the information security domain of availability-based problems, as opposed to the confidentiality or integrity domains, we can clearly see how vulnerabilities correlate with common attacks.Â  However, also notice that attacks are normally complicated ârecipesâ of attempts to exploit both known and unknown (only make preconceived responses to the numerous attack techniques or recipes successfully leveraged against).\n\nPoint One: Tomorrowâs Risks are Here Today.\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  BYOD\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Hacktivist Cyberattacks / Anti-DoS\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  APT\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Zero-Day Threats / Polymorphic Malware\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Social Engineering Risks\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Application-Level Vulnerabilities\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next-Generation DoS (e.g. HTML 5, ReDos, AJAX Injection, etc.\nPoint Two:Â  Have you been able to integrate a risk model to address these threats?\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next Generation Architecture (NG AV, NG Perimeter Defense, NG FW, Zoning)\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next Generation Forensics (Netflow, PCAP, Signaling, etc)\n–Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next Generation Defense â Counter Attack Concepts\n [You might also like: 2017 Considerations before Buying an Attack Mitigation System]\nPoint Three:Â Security is hard, exploring the âtough questionsâ in your environment will expose risks better than todayâs standards-based and compliance-based models.\nAs we continue into 2017, I canât help but be astonished on how effective attacks by hacktivist group Anonymous have been.Â  Vast majorities of targeted organizations have been left licking their wounds and posthumously responding to numerous queries on what happened and why they werenât protected.\nIn fact, the perpetrators of these effective attacks have gotten used to just suggesting that they are going to be angry at an organization in order to get their desired behavioral changes. This was notable when they put Sony, GoDaddy and Nintendo on their target lists for supporting the proposed U.S. Privacy Act (SOPA) only to have each of these companies publically change their positions to reduce the risk of attacks.\nSo, given the efficacy of Anonymous and other hacktivist organizations over the past few years, I thought I would take a stab at highlighting the top six key attributes Anonymous looks to exploit in targeted victims:\n1. Failure to Consider Security-Related Availability Threats. Every certified information security professional understands the principle that ALL security-related activities need to be accomplished in pursuit of one or more of the following: Confidentiality (e.g. Privacy), Integrity and / or Availability. That is, security is DRIVEN by one or more of these principles. It is also no secret that over the past ten years, nearly all security professionals have become intimately engaged with the concepts, theorems and infrastructures required to protect organizations from Privacy and / or Confidentiality leaks, however most of these security professionals have never either thought about or experienced an availability-based security problem. This availability-based threat, or what we call âattacksâ is largely a foreign concept requiring different behavior, infrastructure, reporting and actions. Therein lies the problem and opportunity for hacktivists! Anonymous loves the fact that scores of security professionals fail to realize just how vulnerable their organization is to an outage from simple volumetric threats!\n2. Overreliance on Cloud / ISP Scrubbing Capabilities.  âSign up with your telecom provider and doneâ has been the philosophy for so many organizations for years that the idea of scrubbing enterprise-level data centers has been a remote concept. In fact, so many companies have considered DDoS a check box fulfilled by their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that they paid very little attention to both the complexity or severity of the threat until recently. Well, instead of technically illustrating how insufficient cloud-based DDoS scrubbing is in todayâs world, I will leave with you the illustrations of legions of organizations who were both customers of ISP scrubbers and today have suffered some at the very least, embarrassing, and the very worst, debilitating outages and loss of institutional product and service integrity.\n [You might also like: 2017 Considerations before Buying an Attack Mitigation System]\n3. Never Tested Internal Availability Protections / Vulnerabilities.  âConduct the Vulnerability Assessment without Causing Service Disruption.â Thatâs the verbiage most contracts use when being signed by information security consultants. In other words, conduct a vulnerability assessment; however please donât evaluate our âavailabilityâ vulnerabilities. Everyone knows that for years, organizations have been testing their control infrastructure in almost every way imaginable. They have been conducting technical assessments such as Penetration Tests, Network and Application Vulnerability Assessments, Code Reviews, Architecture Engineering Assessments, etc. They have also tested compliance against regulations and best practices such as GLBA, HIPAA, SOX, PCI, ISO 27001/2, HIPAA HiTECH, etc. However, what most people donât realize is that nearly all of the results of these tests were evaluating security programs and models against threats represented by integrity and confidentiality based attacks, not availability attacks. In fact, to prove this point even further, most modern day vulnerability scanners have either removed âinvasiveâ or availability-based scans from their initial scan profiles, or have made the scans very difficult to launch by a lay person. This has resulted in a mass of organizations who are blissfully ignorant to the vulnerabilities associated with availability attacks (e.g. malformed UDP floods, dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, HTTP POST attacks, etc.) and the probability of success of said attacks.\n4. Inability to Triage Attack for Effective Matching of Priority-Matched Mitigation.  As illustrated in the graphic below, attacks come in multiple layers and frequently in complex (e.g. many vulnerabilities packaged into one lengthy attack). Although most ISPs and Service Providers have established models to âscrub their pipes,â most enterprise security models do not adhere to this model and instead are set up to address each attack sequentially and without a priority assessment to properly allocate resources. Anonymous knows that enterprises suffer from this âvolumetricâ attack profile and frequently bury numerous vulnerabilities into attacks with the assumptions that normal enterprises cannot distinguish between the attack types (e.g. SYN ACK floods with a SQL injection attack â ref: Sony Attacks).\n\n5. Over-reliance on tools â not talent (Static Perimeter Protection Model). We all know that tools will eventually fail us â they donât evolve quickly to match a changed landscape. As with all tools, the assumptions which go into the model are often the first attack vector for a perpetrator. For example, if the enterprise does Data Loss Prevention, well then, just encrypt the traffic and this way you get around the data scrubbing model. When dealing with integrity or confidentiality a company has the luxury of after-action analysis and forensics, however when dealing with âavailability-based âattacks, organizations donât have the luxury of long-drawn out forensic analysis. The capability to determine what is going well, and what is not going well needs to be determined in real time, which means that the deployed detection and mitigation tool set needs to be closely aligned with expert technicians and engineers who can properly configure and reconfigure the tools to avoid and disrupt emerging and changing threat landscapes. Moreover, as illustrated in the slide below, expert skills in the âavailability securityâ disciplines of Network Behavioral Analysis, DDoS Prevention, and Web Application Firewalls are in serious deficits. Hacktivists around the world understand this concept and bank on companies having no intelligent resources to counteract their advancing and evolving techniques. Organizations require instant access to a team of supremely talented individuals – – something we call our Emergency Response Team (ERT)!\n\n6. Failure to recognize / understand application-layer threats. Application-level is Pandoraâs box for hacktivists. Just to give you a quick example of the types of understanding of the complexity of application-layer threats, the following is a list of the questions in which all application-layer security professionals must have on hand AFTER reviewing application vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms about their applications at all times to ensure proper AVAILABILITY of their operations.\nHow many web servers\\web applications?\nWhat type of web applications?\nHow many active connections?\nWhat are the current idle time settings for every web application?\nHow Many Transactions per Second?\nIs acceleration such as a caching used?\nDoes the web sites are public or via CDN?\nWhat is the required CPS?\nDoes the application leverage caching or not?\nIs a response check needed (e.g. Safe Reply filter)?\nAnonymous understands how difficult it is to not only assess the vulnerabilities to a website, but also to run the website in a secure manner without making the site susceptible to a DDoS attack!\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber Security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/security-professional-how-do-you-mitigate-attacks/');

An RDoS campaign is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack motivated by monetary gain. Attackers typically start with an email or a post threatening to launch an attack at a certain day and time unless a ransom in Bitcoin is paid. In some cases, attackers will launch a mini-attack or sample attack on the victim’s network as evidence that the threat is real.\n\nRDoS campaigns can be financially rewarding to a cyber-criminal who enjoys making large amounts of money for little to no investment. Because of this, many hacking groups now imitate this modus operandi and spam similar ransom threats using other group names, with no intention of launching an attack. In 2016 many opportunists emerged using infamous names like the Armada Collective, Anonymous and Lizard Squad to spread fear and gain credibility for their threats.

In South Korea, a number of organizations that received the ransom email also experienced sample SYN and NTP floods ranging between 5-20Gbps. In this campaign, the attackers did not follow through with their original threat even though sample attacks were launched.\nCurrently Radware’s ERT team is tracking a similar campaign in the United States.

And while we are not there yet, it’s clear that the cloud will drive the future of service innovation. However, in my view, the very definition of service innovation is also extended in the cloud environment.\nA prime example in my mind is the expansion of managed services to a cloud managed services model which drives profound business and technical change. While this cloud managed services model continues to be defined in real time, it’s readily apparent that cloud-based managed security services will play a prominent role.\n\nIn fact, they are already a key consideration for enterprise customers of all sizes who face increasing numbers of more advanced and sophisticated cyber threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\nIn response, progressive CSPs are positioning themselves as Managed Security Services Providers (MSSP) leveraging the cloud to deliver a suite of security services, including DDoS, to enterprises that strategically have come to the realization that the cadence of DDoS attacks requires them to partner with a CSP who has the skillset and budget reach to provide the most advanced threat mitigation services. In many respects, adopting this stance and ultimately trusting a CSP for security enforcement represents a logical extension of existing models that enterprises currently utilize with CSPs for network connectivity and specialized enterprise services.\n\nIs the MSSP model monetizable? \nEven though there is pent-up demand for MSSP services, like any cloud deployment business case, the demand must be validated and quantified based on revenue potential vs. offsetting capex and opex costs. In this respect, in theory, traditional engineering economic modeling benchmarks such as Net Present Value (NPV) continue to apply, even though the outputs differ considerably since they reflect the transition to a software-driven model.\nAs a result, it’s vital that CSPs fully understand the business fundamentals before committing to becoming MSSP. Stated another way, potential MSSPs really must conduct due diligence to understand the service-side fundamentals in a DDoS context.\n [You might also like: Enterprises are asking for help to protect their data. Here’s the answer service providers should provide.]\nIn order to answer this vital question, Heavy Reading recently collaborated with Radware to create an MSSP model. The model adopted a bottom-up build methodology incorporating realistic monetization assumptions related to capex and opex, including software licensing and revenue streams.\nSince revenue streams can vary based on enterprise size and scope of DDoS services delivered, we created two DDoS service models to reflect different pricing attributes. The first service model, which we referred to as the On-Demand model, was targeted for small to midsized enterprises, while the Always-On model was designed for larger enterprises. The main difference between the two is that in the On-Demand model, selected data streams are monitored out of path, rather than monitoring every data flow in real time, which is the essence of the Always-On model.\nBased on the modeling assumptions, including revenue streams, we calculated based on known commercial pricing models. We confirmed the MSSP model can deliver strong financial returns. For example, as shown in the tables below, after five years the On-Demand model generated a net cash position of $317.5 million, while the Always-On model generated a net cash position of $348 million. Also worth noting is that in both models, by the end of the first year, the original costs of capex necessary for initial launch had been recovered.\n\n\nIn summary, based on what we consider conservative modeling estimates, it’s clear that for early MSSP adopters the service side of DDoS services already represents a strong and sustainable business opportunity. And looking forward, given the aggressive growth of threat vectors, it’s very likely that MSSP will be an even greater business opportunity as the scope of threat complexities are amplified and more enterprises adopt a managed service model.\n\n\nRead “Cyber Economics: Validating DDoS Managed Service Delivery Models” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'carrier\', \'ddos\', \'managed services\', \'MSSP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/service-side-denial-service/');

While today’s corporate risk assessment certainly involves the aspect of availability, it is focused on redundancy, not on security.  Penetration tests, a result of the corporate risk assessment, also fail to test on availability security.  In fact, pen testing and vulnerability scanning contracts specifically avoid any tests which might cause degradation of service, often leaving these vulnerabilities unknown until it’s too late.  Availability is commonly handed off to be addressed by network engineering to design and build resilient networks.  Common risk mitigations in this arena include redundant power, internet links, routers, firewalls, web farms, storage, and even geographic diversity with use of hot, warm and cold data centers.  You get the picture; there is a ton of money invested in building network infrastructure to meet corporate availability requirements.\n\n\nWhile these investments in infrastructure are meaningful, they are not impervious to attack. In fact, attacks are often complicated and even exacerbated by the inherent resilient design of the network. For example, let’s consider a few common myths:\nMyth 1: DDoS attacks consume lots of bandwidth and are noisy. We will add additional bandwidth if we come under DDoS attack or we already have enough bandwidth to absorb any attack.\nA recent study by Radware’s ERT and other competitors report a significant change in the threat landscape, from noisy volumetric floods (TCP SYN or UDP Floods), to application layer (HTTP GET and DNS query floods) and low-and-slow attacks. A volumetric attack can consume any amount of bandwidth you can afford. Admittedly, additional bandwidth may delay the outcome and if significant (100Gbps +), it might even deter an attacker. However, a targeted attack is one in which the attacker is after your business, not your competitor or the guy down the street. He will shift gears to find weakness in your defense; more than likely at the application layer.\n [You might also like: How are IoT Skills different than IT Skills?]\n\nMyth 2: Route traffic through secondary data center or split the load across data centers.\nLet’s take a DNS flood targeting a DNS server as an example. Some folks I’ve chatted with might consider failing over to a redundant data center in the event they are flooded at the primary, or even operating off a different IP address range for the secondary. However, let’s not underestimate our enemies – unfortunately the attack would follow in either event. You might ask why or how the attack would migrate. For one, if you reroute your traffic, the attack will simply follow the target. While changing or using different IP address ranges might buy you some time, security by obscurity is proven not to prevail. In addition, many attacks today target domain names, so you would find the attack simply following the DNS change.\nMyth 3: We are safe from this threat because we use a CDN or cloud DDoS scrubbing solutions.\nWhile CDN and cloud scrubbing centers serve their purpose and can be used as mitigation technique, they are also not conclusive of an attack mitigation system. By nature of the CDN, it can be bypassed by several tools (HULK, LOIC, HOIC, and more) which were purposely built to bypass such protections and utilize dynamically changing URLs. In fact, the CDN will not only leave one wanting for Anti-DoS, it’s known to amplify the attack as per recent blogs by my colleague, David Hobbs, CDN as a Weapon and You Cant Hide Behind the Clouds. In addition, neither the CDN nor cloud scrubbers can protect against encrypted attacks, unless of course you are willing to share your encryption keys with outsiders. Hmm, that doesn’t sound like a good idea…Does it? Another disadvantage of the cloud scrubbing center is that it is usually an on-demand service which requires rerouting traffic once under attack. Cloud scrubbing typically consists of several steps upon an attack. It begins with detection, alerting, route change, attack mitigation, verification of legitimate traffic, and finally detecting once the attack is over to put traffic back in its normal state. This detection is not a simple feat, even in the case of a network flood where an administrator may be alerted via email of bandwidth usage on a circuit. What if they don’t get the email because the email server is being DoS’d? What if the attack is over the weekend and no one notices, except your customers who are trying to purchase equipment from your ecommerce site?\nTargeted attacks are driven by humans utilizing sophisticated tools, C&C and botnets, which require attack mitigation tools that can adapt to the threat and mitigate based upon abnormal behavior. In conjunction with tactical tools, a sound perimeter counter-defense strategy will also include a human factor. As with all layers of security, availability security is like a game of chess with the enemy that requires strategy and tactics. Use available tools to learn the normal behavior of your environment, detect, alert and mitigate anomalies, known and zero day intrusions in real time. Properly tuned tools will keep the enemy at bay for a limited time however it is inevitable they will adjust their attack campaign and identify weakness in your defense. Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) provides the human factor of knowing the enemy, reverse engineering the attack tools and identifying the opponents’ next move.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite” to learn more. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'availability\', \'CDN\', \'Cloud\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'DNS\', \'IT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/prepare-for-change-it-security-availability-threat/');

They target the network layer up through the application layer, where attacks are more difficult to detect since they can easily get confused with legitimate traffic.\nA denial of service attack generates high or low rate attack traffic exhausting computing resources of a target, therefore preventing legitimate users from accessing the website. A DDoS attack can always cause an outage, but often they have the stealth impact of slowing down network performance in way that enterprise IT teams do not even realize the network is under attack and simply think the network is congested, not knowing the congestion is actually caused by an attack.\n\n\nType of attacks\nThere are many types of DDoS attacks targeting both the network and the application layers. They can be classified upon their impact on the targeted computing resources (saturating bandwidth, consuming server’s resources, exhausting an application) or upon the targeted resources as well:\n\nAttacks targeting Network Resources: UDP Floods, ICMP Floods, IGMP Floods.\nAttacks targeting Server Resources: the TCP/IP weaknesses -TCP SYN Floods, TCP RST attacks, TCP PSH+ACK attacks – but also Low and Slow attacks such as Sockstress for example and SSL-based attacks, which detection is particularly challenging.\nAttacks targeting the Application Resources: HTTP Floods, DNS Floods and other Low and Slow attacks as Slow HTTP GET requests (e.g. Slowloris) and Slow HTTP POST requests (e.g. R-U-Dead-Yet).\n\nMulti-vector attacks target all layers of the application infrastructure\nWhy are they hard to detect?\nDDoS attacks are hard to detect and block since the attack traffic is easily confused with legitimate traffic and therefore difficult to trace. A distributed denial of service attack usually comprises more than three unique attack vectors, thus increasing the attacker’s chances penetrate its target and escape basic DoS mitigation solutions.\n [You might also like: Eliminating Single Points of Failure, Part 1]\nWhat are the common DDoS attack mitigation approaches?\nRecent DDoS attacks have taught us that traditional network security solutions such as firewall, IPS and WAF cannot stop DDoS attacks. They are all stateful devices and their session tables get full under a network flood. In addition, DDoS attacks are not simply about volume. Some sophisticated techniques can cause network outages while completely evading conventional detection – such as Low and Slow, or SSL- based attack.\nOrganizations that want to guarantee the availability of online services from DDoS attacks should consider a dedicated DDoS attack mitigation solution that is specifically designed to deal with today’s emerging threats, combining volumetric protection with behavioral mechanism that identifies application attacks on real time and puts a best case filter in place that blocks the attack while letting legitimate user traffic through and maintaining the SLA.\nThere are three approaches to DDoS attack mitigation:\n\nOn-premise – When a DDoS solution is deployed on premise, organizations benefit from an immediate and automatic attack detection and mitigation solution. Within seconds of the start of an attack, the online services are well protected and the attack is mitigated. However, on premise DDoS solutions cannot handle volumetric network floods that saturate the Internet pipe of the enterprise. Such attacks must be mitigated from the cloud.\nCloud – Often referred to as “clean pipe,” this type of mitigation is guaranteed to block network flood attacks from ever reaching the organization’s network or data center, as attacks are mitigated before they reach the connection between the ISP/MSSP and the organization. However, cloud-based DDoS mitigation services cannot block application DDoS attacks nor do they provide the detection layer as they are focused on mitigation.\nHybrid – Hybrid DDoS solutions offer best-of-breed attack mitigation by combining on premise and cloud mitigation into a single, integrated solution. With a hybrid solution, attack detection and mitigation starts immediately using the on premise mitigation device to prevent availability-based attacks from harming the application layer. In case of a pipe saturation threat, the hybrid solution activates the cloud mitigation and the traffic is diverted to the cloud, where it is scrubbed before being sent back to the enterprise. An ideal hybrid solution also shares essential information about the attack between on premise mitigation devices and cloud devices in order to accelerate and enhance attack mitigation once it reaches the cloud.\n\nIn the last 10 years, cyber security attacks have become significantly more sophisticated. We have seen the rise of application specific attacks that target the applications on a network (HTTP, DNS, SIP/VoLTE, other) and try to overwhelm the server application, not the connectivity pipe. Detection algorithms needed to evolve to keep up.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Firewalls are a necessary first step in protecting IT networks, however its protection is limited to create the first line of defense – marking the border between the internal network and the outside world. As we have discussed, DDOS attacks are a very common form of attack which is easily launched that cannot be protected by a firewall. DDOS attacks can cause outages or congestion in the network and many of the most sophisticated attacks cannot be mitigated by conventional solutions.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/07/eliminating-single-points-failure-part-2/');

Allegedly, an ex-employee retained access to personal identifying information and sold data records to people who filed fraudulent tax returns using the data. Federal criminal charges were filed against the ex-employee.\n\n\nThe first question that pops out on this is:  If the ex-employee committed a crime and illegally accessed the data, why did the hospital get such a hefty fine? According to the report from the Office of Civil Rights, “At the root of this breach was MHS’s failure to follow its own polices and deactivate the login credentials of a former employee from an affiliated physician’s office. Over the course of roughly a year, these credentials were repeatedly used to gain access to MHS’s data systems and client ePHI.”\nThis isn’t the only case of the office of Civil Rights issuing fines over HIPAA violations.  We’ve seen numerous violations and breaches resulting in multimillion dollar fines.   Many organizations didn’t believe that data breach would ever result in them getting a fine.  Some organizations thought that data breach insurance would cover them and used that instead of actually securing their systems.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s Cottage Health System in December 2013 notified 32,755 of its patients whose protected health information had been compromised after the health system and one of its third-party vendors, inSync, stored unencrypted medical records on a system accessible to the Internet.

Many don’t believe that GDPR will actually leverage fines against their business. The GDPR implements a two-tiered approach to categorizing violations and related fines. The most significant breaches of the GDPR’s obligations can result in a fine of up to 4 percent of a company’s annual global revenue, or €20 million (whichever is greater). These higher-tier violations include failing to obtain the necessary level of customer consent to process data, failing to permit data subjects to exercise their rights including as to data erasure and portability, and transferring personal data outside the EU without appropriate safeguards. For less serious violations, which include failing to maintain records of customer consent or failing to notify the relevant parties when a data breach has occurred, the maximum fine is limited to 2 percent of annual global revenue, or €10 million (whichever is greater).\nCompanies not located in the EU but that process the data of EU customers will have to appoint a representative in the EU under the GDPR. In relation to enforcement, we can take a look at the USA and determine how this might work in Asia. The GDPR directs EU authorities to develop international cooperation mechanisms to support its extraterritorial reach, which could potentially build upon existing treaties and mutual investigative assistance agreements the EU has in place with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in the United States.  Companies should be aware that the EU is increasing its efforts to work with and through American authorities to investigate American targets, which may yield increased scrutiny on companies with an EU web presence.\nIf we look at India for a moment, the Indian outsourcing industry nearly stands at over 150 Billion USD, contributing nearly 9.3% to the GDP. More than 100 Billion USD of revenues comes from overseas, largely attributed to cross border data flow, that too from majority of countries of western regions and European Union (EU). With factors like data privacy and security becoming an important determinant in outsourcing, the global landscape on data flows is likely to be impacted.\nOther industries you may not think about, such as airlines, car rentals and hotels which allow booking from the internet, may be impacted. Will the HITECH Act fines become the harbinger of much larger fines to come?  Which countries will have cooperation with the EU, and which might get banned? Would banning nations from doing business with EU citizens force compliance?  Would “content filtering” the internet for offenders cause a large disruption in their business?

Well it might be good for your everyday life – obviously, you don’t need to extract the most out of your brain and muscles for the day-to-day to-do’s, but there is no guarantee that there is nothing there that negatively impacts your performance, or may be silently growing.\n\n\nIn the information age, businesses rely more than ever on the speed and accuracy of data. It needs to be secured, and it needs to be clear for whoever receives it (man or machine). While most of us who generally feel ‘good’ do not worry so much about health checks – certainly not on a daily basis – as long as we manage to do what we need to do, IT teams invest most if not all of their time making sure the information system performs at its best. Why? Because time is money.\nFollowing information-security media outlets for the past year, one may think that there are IoT botnets in every corner bringing enterprise networks down on their knees, but the reality is different. Despite the record-breaking volumes we have seen in 2016, non-volumetric DDoS is still prevalent. This denial-of-service technique is still proven to be very efficient in exhausting network and server resources. Moreover, a non-volumetric attack can evade detection mechanisms and consume bandwidth and resources without the target knowing—affecting service-level quality.\n56% of internet traffic is bots\nSource: https://areyouahuman.com/downloads/GoodBotsvBadBots_FINAL.pdf\nSome are good and regulated for the most part, like search engine crawlers, automated trading and instant media updates – yet a significant part of internet traffic is generated by bad bots – from spammers and click-fraudsters to vulnerability scanners and malware spreaders. Traffic used to form DDoS attacks falls under that category as well.\n [You might also like: How Do You Create a Flight Plan to a Never-Ending Journey?]\nAttack Size: Does It Matter?\nNot everyone can generate such astonishing amounts of traffic. In 2016, less than 10% of server attacks qualified as extra-large (10Gbps or higher). Seven in 10 server attacks were below 100Mbps, of which 50% were 10Mbps or less. Despite the notorious IoT botnet attacks, those ranging from 10Gbps to 50Gbps decreased from 8% in 2015 to 3% in 2016. Why?\nDDoS attackers are becoming more sophisticated and more familiar with the security solutions in the market today. They know that most protections limit the rate (with or without being able to distinguish between legitimate user traffic and bad traffic) so they choose other techniques (for instance, low-and-slow attacks or alternatively, short bursts). Perpetrators – be those hackers, hacktivists, business competitors etc. – do not always intend to completely take the network down, but understand that they can cause a sensible impact by launching attacks of a lower profile that in many cases the targeted organization will absorb without even noticing or knowing.\nThree in five respondents report a cyber-attack that is 10 million packets-per-second (PPS) or less, and about one fifth indicated they suffered an attack between 10 million PPS and 100 million PPS. The number of attacks that were 100 million PPS or less increased from 76% in 2015 to 82% in 2016. Those with 10 million PPS or less increased from 50% in 2015 to 63% in 2016.\nBusinesses lose\nUnder such conditions, unfortunately, the network is not at its optimized performance. Consequently, the business is not at it top performance. While it may run well enough for the most part – sometimes feeling good can be deceiving. Even if most of the information flows accurately and securely, resources of the organizations are still consumed, whether this is a share-of-pipe serving dirty traffic or man hours in log analysis. Users today expect a prompt response of any application or web page. If the attack doesn’t trigger any control, it goes below the radar and the company doesn’t always understand that they are not at their best.\n(Healthy) Food for Thought:\nTo avoid losses of time, revenue and reputation, business should be aware of the situation and try to assess what is the impact of rubbish traffic on their operation, and what their customers experience. It is clear that these attacks do not reach the threshold of most rate-limit DDoS protection, and therefore go undetected. Traffic purification can only be done by a DDoS solution that leverages a behavioral analysis algorithm that learns baselines and patterns of legitimate requests in peacetime, and maintains the peace by cleaning unwanted requests as they come in.\nGetting the network health back into shape will immediately translate into a better performance, and a ‘good’ feeling.\nRead “How to Evaluate a Vendor for DDoS Protection”\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Bots\', \'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'DoS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/06/network-high-cholesterol/');

Firewalls have evolved considerably over the years, with the advent of next-generation firewalls to add application-aware filtering and intrusion detection capabilities and help customers improve their first line of defense. However, DDoS attacks are one vector where Firewalls are commonly the point of failure. In fact, Radware’s own research shows that the firewall is the cause of downtime during DDoS attacks roughly one-third of the time. The reason for this is the stateful nature of these devices, required to keep track of open sessions and transactions on the network. Maintaining session state requires use of session tables as well as other CPU resources that are finite and also responsible for other security features. Therefore under attack, the session table can be exhausted causing the firewall to fail.\n\nMyths about Using the Firewall or IPS for DDOS Protection\nA common misconception is that traditional network security devices, such as a firewall or IPS can be used protect from DDoS flood attacks. Network DDoS attacks trigger large numbers of new connections require stateful resources to manage the load. In addition, Firewalls cannot determine legitimate versus malicious users when under application DDoS attacks. An HTTP flood attack, for example, since it can be made up of millions of legitimate HTTP sessions, can fill the firewall or IPS state table and overwhelm the device. Some may suggest that investing in a larger firewall will address this problem, but in the long term the resources available to attackers to launch high traffic attacks with a large number of connections will always be greater than the capacity of even the largest of firewalls.\nDDoS in Review\nA Denial-of-Service DOS attack is an attack targeting the availability of network resources and applications. Unlike other kinds of attacks, DoS attacks’ primary goal is not so much to infiltrate data, but rather to slow or take down altogether a network device, an application, and/or a website. The attackers’ motivations are diverse, ranging from simple fun (simply to show they can), financial gain (to make a profit), and ideology (political hacktivism).\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with a high volume of traffic. It can target a wide variety of important network and application resources and presents a major challenge to users’ ability to publish and access important information. \nA Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is the most common variant of Denial-of-Service attacks where an attacker or a group of attackers employ multiple machines to carry out a DoS attack simultaneously, therefore increasing its effectiveness and strength. The “army” carrying out the attack is mostly often composed of unknowingly infected zombie computers manipulated as (ro)bots and controlled as a botnet by the attacker via a remote Command and Control Server. A botnet is powerful, well-coordinated attack and could count millions of computers. It also insures the anonymity of the original attacker since the attack traffic originates from the bots’ IP addresses rather than the attacker’s. In recent years, attackers have the ability to use spoofed IP addresses or use content delivery networks thus disguising their origin.\nDDoS attack illustration: A DNS flood attack\n [You might also like: How Do You Create a Flight Plan to a Never-Ending Journey?]\nThough DDOS attacks may not be thought about on a daily basis by the general public, there are a number of these cases every day in the news:\nHacking in Education\nCase Study: Augusta County Public Schools, Virginia\nThe Virginia school was unable to maintain uninterrupted access to online resources for testing and SOL.\nSummary: Technology coordinator Gary Bryant cites an attack in 2015 consisting of a UDP flood from a botnet, which completely swamped the school system’s inbound network pipe. The attack impacted the technology center, which is responsible for providing and maintaining just under 7,500 devices across the county’s 20 elementary, middle and high schools, as well as maintaining a Web presence for the school system.  The attack threatened the school’s ability to satisfy government standards for online testing systems, which require uninterrupted access to Standards of Learning (SOL) information and testing hosted by the Virginia Department of Education.\nDDOS for Hire\nCase Study: Fiverr Testing Stresser Services\nSummary: DoS for hire services often refer to themselves as ‘stressers,’ services that are intended for people to stress test their own websites and servers. But since these stressers don’t require users to prove website ownership prior to these so-called stress tests, stressers have become a simple way to aim a DDoS attack at any website a user wants.  According to www.informationsecuritybuzz.com, in 2015 the average cost of using a stresser was $38 per hour, and the low end of the pricing spectrum was around $19.  However, recently it has become even cheaper to inflict major harm on businesses, as according to the Underground Hacker Marketplace Report, using a stresser on the Russian underground is just $5 per hour.\nOpensource DDOS\nDDOS attacks can be inexpensively bought or available through Opensource.  Reportedly, one of the tools that has enabled the WikiLeaks organization is the open source Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), an open source network stress testing and denial-of-service attack application written in C#.  WikiLeaks has been a mainstream reporting organization wreaking havoc on political figures and parties, most recently at the US Democratic Party National Convention.\nMore recently released into the public domain, the High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC), has been made available as a denial-of-service attack application written in BASIC and designed to attack as many as 256 URLs at the same time.\nDecoy Attacks\nAccording to www.esecurityplanet.com, there is a clear link between DDOS attacks used as a decoy to mask the primary intent of stealing personal or corporate data.  The report cites that 55 percent of all DDoS targets were also victims of security breaches where attackers stole funds, customer data or intellectual property. Nearly half the time the victims had viruses or other malware installed or activated on their systems during the DDoS attack.\nMalware-infected Mobile Bot Attacks\nWe have even seen the rise of smartphone botnets over the last few years. Malware like DroidJack is easily leveraged to target mobile users via malicious 3rd party app stores that are offering popular games like Pokémon Go, but with a surprise waiting for them inside the unverified Android application package, APK.

These tools included FuzzBunch, an exploitation framework similar to Metasploit. Inside of FuzzBunch there was an exploit called EternalBlue and a payload called DoublePulsar. EternalBlue is an exploit that targets Microsoft’s SMB Protocol. The exploit allowed the attackers to send a specially crafted message to gain unauthorized access to machines around the world. Once accessed, the payload DoublePulsar is delivered and triggered to download WannaCry. After being infected with WannaCry, the worm scans nearby machines it can target in the same way and begins to move laterally within the network, transferring the malicious payload to more and more endpoints.\nFuzzBunch via Miguel Diaz Lirahttps://github.com/mdiazcl/fuzzbunch-debian\nOn May 10th, CVE-2017-0144, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64) – ‘SrvOs2FeaToNt’ SMB Remote Code Execution was added to ExploitDB and leveraged exploits disclosed in MS17-010. Two days later the WannaCry campaign broke out and infected computers all around the world. Upon infection, WannaCry ransomware executes a file that sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded domain. This is a killswitch. If the request for the domain is successful, WannaCry ransomware will exit and not deploy. If the request fails, it continues to infect devices on the network. When the campaign began on Friday, a security researcher, @MalwareTechBlog, noticed the killswitch domain was unregistered. He promptly registered the domain and directed the requests to a sinkhole, thereby effectively preventing this variant from spreading further.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n@MalwareTechBlog\n [You might also like: WannaCrypt]\nOn May 13th another researcher, @msuiche, discovered a second variant with a different killswitch. @msuiche also registered the domain and directed the request to his own sinkhole, preventing the spread of the second variant. Around May 17th the sinkhole operators reported DDoS attacks targeting the sinkholes, a likely move to take the domain offline so the WannaCry variants could infect their victims. A third variant even surfaced that did not rely on a killswitch. A few days later, decryption tools started coming out for Windows. As individuals and corporations patched their systems around the world, infections decreased but we are still seeing scans against port 445 as the number one attack against our honeypots. At the time of writing the original Bitcoin wallets received 326 payments totaling 51.618 BTC or $144,095 and targeted over 100 countries.\n@actual_ransom\nWhile investigating WannaCry, Kafeine reported that an exposed ProofPoint honeypot vulnerable to EternalBlue was attacked within 20 minutes of exposure. Expecting to see WannaCry, they were actually infected with a cryptocurrency miner, Adylkuzz. Infection of Adylkuzz ultimately caused service degradation for infected devices. It was revealed by ProofPoint that this campaign leveraging the same exploits used by WannaCry predated the ransomware campaign. It was also revealed in ProofPoints’ research that Adylkuzz, upon infection, shut down the SMB protocol to prevent further infection from different types of malware using the same exploit. In parallel with mitigating WannaCry, users patching against the SMB vulnerability also were protecting their devices from Adylkuzz.\nKafeine’s research related to Adylkuzz\nSamba, an open source software that provides Windows file sharing access to non-Windows machine using SMB/CIFS protocol recently disclosed a similar remote code execution vulnerability to WannaCry that allows users authorized access via the SMB protocol. There is even a working exploit leveraging CVE-2017-7494 for Metasploit. Linux.MulDrop.14, as reported by Dr.Web, is a Linux Trojan that is currently delivering a crypto-mining program and targeting raspberry Pi’s that have default credentials. This piece of malware is exploiting the recent disclosure from Samba in CVE-2017-7494. It’s also reported that this strain of malware downloads zmap and sshpass so it can search the network for devices with port 22 open to infect.\nIn all cases, attackers are aggressively scanning the internet looking for vulnerable devices with port 445 exposed. The reason why so many machines were infected during the campaign was due to users neglecting to install security updates in a timely fashion. In the case of WannaCry, Microsoft’s security update was released a month before the Shadow Brokers leaked the FuzzBunch framework that included the exploits and payload used in the campaign. The best prevention for attacks in general is through maintenance and patching. Users need to get into a habit of patching their devices on a regularly basis, segmenting networks when possible and changing default credentials.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'malware\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\', \'WannaCry\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/06/smb-vulnerabilities-wannacry-adylkuzz-sambacry/');

All respondents represent organizations with at least $250 million (or the equivalent) in annual revenue. Our goal: to understand their greatest challenges, threats and opportunities when it comes to cyber security.\n\nWhen boarding a plane, have you ever wondered how much the pilot worries about the plane’s safety? His main job is to navigate through clouds and turbulence and land the aircraft at the right place at the right time.\nA couple of advantages pilots have over executives today is that A) they have fully automated visibility into almost all real-time events, so they don’t have to rely on the human staff to collect and feed the information, and B) their journey has a definite destination and end.\nWe asked chief officers (CxOs) about their flight plan, from their cybersecurity concerns perspective. 200 executives from Europe and North America have expressed similar concerns, as well as similar goals, but showed different flight plans to get there.\nCyber Security can be ignored no longer\nNeither can it be underestimated.\nExecutives today understand the importance of mitigating the risks posed by information security flaws to their business, and better yet – the opportunity in building cyber-resilience. Four out of five executives affirm that security threats are now a board-level concern. Further, almost all participants (94%) rate security as an extremely or very important priority. In addition, cyber-security is the number-one driver of their digital transformation programs, with 47% of executives citing improving information security as a major goal of their digital transformation.\n60% of executives confirm having been a victim to at least one cyber-attack.\nWhen the majority of the enterprises are under fire, no wonder this growing concern takes center stage at the board level discussions. While this finding is consistent with last year’s executive survey, it represents a much lower number than the 98% reported by information security practitioners in Radware’s Global Network and Application Security Report.\nAn interesting insight was the significant difference between European executives and their American counterparts – Europeans were more likely to report an attack than their American counterparts (75% vs. 36%). This is quite interesting and after scratching our heads for quite a while, we came up with few possible explanations:\n\nCultural differences in reporting and sharing information regarding ‘non-events’\nRegulatory requirements where reporting upwards is mandatory\nA relatively higher preparedness level in the U.S. to cyber-security incidents\n\n [You might also like: A View from the Corner Offices: New Research on C-Suite Security Mindset]\nWilling to Invest in Intelligent Technologies\nFour in five executives reported having already implemented more reliance on automated security solutions. Understanding the complexity of managing security these days, as the traditional network perimeter dissolves into an amorphous array of information hubs across platforms and third parties, and there is a need to facilitate and secure a growing number of data currents – this is becoming too demanding for organizations to try to handle themselves. The human factor is never ‘error-free’, and the need of the hour is automated solutions that dynamically update their controls and policies in real-time. Around the globe, two in five indicated that within two years, automated security systems—with machine-learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms—will be the primary resources to maintain cyber security.\n\nRadware’s research also points to a perceptional shift among C-suite executives—who seem to be warming to the idea of security supported by forms of automation rather than humans.\nHowever, they are open to the idea of getting hackers onto their IT security teams (58% in Europe, 27% in North America). In fact, in Europe inviting hackers to test security systems, network infrastructure and databases is already a common practice. At the end of the day, hackers tend to think out of the box and can help with vulnerability mapping and forensics. At Radware, we see tremendous value in tapping into that experience and perspective.\n\nCorporate Responsibility? Executives challenged with user privacy, despite a possible business impact\nTwo-thirds of executives agree that current laws related to information-security compromise privacy. Further, 79% think the government should do more to protect consumers’ personal information—and that is true even among those conceding that more stringent legislation could adversely affect their day-to-day operations.\nMost-feared cyber-attacks\nBusiness leaders worry mostly about corporate espionage, confidential data leakage or unknown, invisible impacts on their business. Concerning cyber-attack types, three in five executives claim that malware and bots or ransomware attacks would be extremely or very detrimental to their business. Other detrimental threats include Web application attacks and distributed denial of service, followed by APTs and socially-engineered infiltrations.\nToday, they view a weakness in their cyber posture directly correlated with a risk to their competitiveness, particularly if it results in bad customer experience, reputational damage or revenue loss.\n\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Recommendations from the C-Suite]\nRansom attacks: Reported decline \nThe survey took place before the worldwide WannaCrypt campaign on May 12th (read Radware’s full report on WannaCrypt here).\nGlobally, only 12% reported being the victim of such an attack. While the vast majority declare that they will not be paying any ransom if extorted, it is interesting to learn that this sentiment is stronger among executives who have already experienced a cyber-extortion attempt.\nAlthough we saw a decrease in the prevalence of extortion attempts in the cyber space, the WannaCrypt campaign reinforces Radware’s 2016-17 Global Application & Network Security Report’s indication that ransom was the top motivation behind cyber-attacks in 2016. Cyber criminals looking for financial gain will not let go of such a rewarding tactic so easily.\nAre we on the right track?\nReading the report, one can enjoy a sense of optimism, as despite the inevitable evolution of cyber threats, business leaders comprehend the challenge and take actions. These actions are to not only protect their organization by investing in cutting-edge defensive technologies, but also play a social role when guarding user privacy, collaborating with the regulators and sharing information within the community. With that notion, information security is becoming a top priority, and if organizations will implement dynamic mechanisms of continuously adaptive security, we may be able to stay close behind the cyber-delinquents.\nHowever, this notion is not fully absorbed by the majority of organizations, and there is still a long way to go until it will become the common practice, and all solutions will be successfully deployed to protect companies and individuals. We would like to believe that in five years’ time, we will see a different picture.\n\n\nRead “Cyber-Security Perceptions and Realities: A View from the C-Suite” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AI\', \'Artificial Intelligence\', \'automation\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'privacy\', \'Ransom\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/06/c-suite-flight-plan-to-never-ending-journey/');

This new uCPE market is resulting from enterprise demand that virtualized security functions reside physically inside the walls of enterprise locations.”  The trends that Howard cites are:\n\n\nExpectation of on-demand services\nNFV and SDN acceleration on COTS servers\nOperators’ need for revenue generation, capex savings, and opex optimization\nSD-WAN adoption by enterprises\nCompute at the edge of the network\n\n\nIn a recent study, IHS reported that 85 percent of operators plan to deploy physical uCPE at a location to run virtual network functions (VNFs).  Some well-known operators are leading the charge.\nFor example, consider most recently the announcement from AT&T that they are buying the Vyatta virtual router SW from Brocade for its uCPE strategy.\nThis move propels AT&T forward in its uCPE strategy similarly to the Verizon announcement I wrote about recently.  As with Verizon, this will enable AT&T to deploy uCPE in a generic Linux server and remotely provision VNFs, including the two most common: VPN connectivity and security.  IHS research has shown they expect uCPE to become a 750M USD market.\n [You might also like: Increased interest in Managed Security at Light Reading NFV and Carrier SDN event]\nAT&T’s strategy here is interesting in that they are buying the router OS and the R&D teams.

I do a lot of listening, honestly, and I get the chance to learn a lot from these conversations.\nOver the past few weeks, Risk and Risk Management have been common topics of discussion. They can be challenging because every business is different and we all face different risks or threats. Some of us have regulatory or compliance controls that we must operate within, which define how we handle certain risks. Others have customers who require that we maintain certain protocols and certifications as a method of protecting their data. Still, others have no programs in place at all.\n\nOne of the tasks of the CISO is to assess cyber threats and risks to the organization and to make recommendations on how to protect against them. So what are CISOs and security leaders concerned with right now? Here’s a recap of some of the messages I’ve heard over the past two weeks.\n\nSize and Scope Might Be Indicative of Your Risk Program\n“A risk program, you say?” Not all businesses have implemented a risk program. Others live by it. One CISO described how your risk program is likely influenced by the following:\n– The purpose of your business\n– How many employees you have\n– Whether or not you’re a public company\n– How long you’ve been in business\nFor example, a startup may not have a strong risk practice. Perhaps they’re more likely focused on growing a business with limited means. Do they hire a CISO? Probably not immediately (if at all), but maybe their idea, technology, or other intellectual property is the crown jewel of their business. Protecting those assets may be critical to the future of the business.\nOn the other hand, a multinational financial company could have dozens of regional regulations with which they must comply. These companies have a much more mature risk program. In fact, many global organizations have CISOs dedicated to specific regions to assist with this complexity.\n“Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time.”\nOne security leader recently referenced this quote from the movie “Sully” when discussing his risk program. While often used as inspiration, this quote is incredibly relevant in cyber security. Security practitioners share the task of keeping our companies alive, online, and safe.\nI think this quote stands on its own.\n [You might also like: From the Corner Office: Views from a Chief Information Security Officer]\nThe CEO Usually Doesn’t Want to Know the Details About Your Risk Program\nThe CEO wants to know how you’re dealing with risk, but they usually don’t want to know the exact details (unless maybe they need to understand or they are part of risk committees). That’s why they have you, the CISO. Instead, they need to understand how you are handling risk. Develop a clear and concise summary of your risk profile and what you are doing about it. The CEO needs to be able to tell Board members, shareholders, and customers if, how, and why you’re safe, but help him or her develop a clear way to explain your risk program.\nUse Internal Auditing as a Tool\nLet’s face it, nobody enjoys auditing. However, one CISO that I talked with recommends that you embrace it. It can be difficult, but if you trust the process and commit to it, an internal audit can help you reach your security goals.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nFor example, an internal audit can help find gaps in protections that would ultimately need to be defined as risks. From there, you can define the likelihood of the risk, the impact to the business, and finally make a recommendation to mitigate the risk. Some of this might include budget allocation, which may help you achieve other goals as well.\nTelecommuting Employees Are Bad at Backups\nDo you have remote employees or contractors? Do they have laptops? Are they backing up data? Several discussions focused on this topic recently, specifically because of the WannaCry outbreak. If you do have remote workers in your network, how are they backing up their laptops? Laptops are usually opened while working and closed while not, meaning the backups have to be completed while open.\nIf they are backing up, are they using home resources or a central corporate server/resource? If it’s the latter, are they on VPN? Residential internet links don’t always have fast uplink speeds, making remote backups a chore for the user. Even if they run during the day, with slow upload speeds, a user might notice the burden of a saturated uplink on their residential link during the backup and even perhaps abort it, or avoid it altogether.\nThis recipe creates two common scenarios; telecommuters who either don’t back up their data regularly or they back up to non-corporate resources. We would all agree that using non-corporate resources to store corporate data presents risk, but so does foregoing backups.\nTeach Your Employees About Risk\nThe CISO is accountable for cyber risk, but everyone should be invested in protecting the company. The good news is that threat awareness inside of organizations seems to be increasing. However, employees must also understand why cyber threats can also threaten the business directly. From safe internet browsing to developers coding with security in mind, everyone needs to understand how their activities impact the company’s risk profile.\n [You might also like: Ask Yourself: Do I Need an Emergency Response Plan? WHY?]\nIn the same vein, teach your employees that they need to trust you and the IT teams if something has happened. Be approachable and make sure employees understand that they can safely reach out to your team in the event of a suspected issue. We would all rather know about something immediately than finding out later, the hard way.\n40% of Businesses Don’t Have an Incident Response Plan\nRadware’s 2016-2017 Global Application & Network Security Report found that 40% of businesses do not have an incident response plan in place. Handling a security crisis can often come down to preparation. Even if you don’t have a security budget, you can still plan for what you will do if you encounter a security problem. Understand who needs to be notified, both internally and externally, as well as who will be involved in your response. Then practice it. Those first few minutes and hours will be critical to how you fare under duress.\nCyber Insurance Can Transfer Risk\nThe same report referenced above also found that 70% of businesses do not have cyber insurance. We also found that businesses tend to underestimate the cost of a cyber-event by 50%. A cyber insurance policy might be a way for you to transfer certain risks away from your organization. However, the feedback in the community is that policies vary drastically and you should have your legal team heavily involved if or when you decide on a policy.\nThe greatest observation from these discussions is that we all have different levels of risk tolerance. We also have different levels in maturity of our programs. But as security leaders, we understand that how we approach risk is critical to our business. Use risk assessments to help drive your security goals. Gain the attention of the senior leadership in your organization by defining risks that you face, their likelihood of occurrence, their impact to the business, and your recommendation to mitigate them.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'CISO\', \'incident response\', \'risk management\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/06/risk-management-ciso-perspective/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (126, 'The World is Changing', 'Daniel Lakier', '2017-6-7', 'The world is changing; it always has but the world is changing faster now than it ever has before. This general change is translating into even bigger changes in the cyber world. Some of the key areas that are evolving aren’t new, like availability or security. Others like automation are maturing quickly, and then there is the ever-present need for “easy.” Easy is a nebulous term, but in this case it refers to ease of procurement, ease of set up, flexibility in platform and ease of ongoing management.\nThis accelerated change is being driven by different market and business drivers. Some of the key market drivers are compliance, time to market, cyber loss risk, and increased competition around the user experience. This change is acutely felt in the ADC space.\nCompliance mostly affects security but in some cases touches on availability as well. Tied closely to compliance is the risk of cyber loss caused by a cyber-attack.  As the world’s IT infrastructures become less insular and more public (SAAS, public clouds etc.), organizations have had to move away from protecting infrastructure and a security model that protects data. The common standard for protecting web data and integrity while in motion is SSL/TLS. The usage of this encryption technology dramatically increased last year. According to Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, SSL encrypted traffic accounted for 50% of all internet traffic. This increased usage has several unintended consequences.\n\nFirst, SSL can protect our data but it also limits our visibility to data coming into our networks using the same technology. Why is this lack of visibility important? In the past, corporations usually ignored incoming SSL traffic. They made the choice that SSL traffic represented such a minute amount of all inbound traffic that ignoring it was an acceptable risk. This was not just a concept shared by most security vendors (the equipment that would need visibility to limit risk). So for example, if you bought/buy a firewall today, at worst you lose 85% of your throughput. At best you lose 70% of your throughput if you decide to inspect SSL traffic. Obviously that doesn’t allow you to cover enough traffic if 50% of it is SSL-encrypted. Compounding this problem is that most analysts agree that by the year 2020, well above 70% of the internet will be SSL encrypted.\n [You might also like: To stay secure: Four new SSL implementation thoughts]\nSo what’s the answer? Using an external device that was purposefully built to do SSL offload and inspection. For the past 15 years, ADCs have been doing SSL offload at high throughputs and have become a very cost-effective solution to the problem. However, pushing against this general need for visibility is our old friend, compliance. Yes, you need to secure your data but you also need to not violate a person’s right to privacy. This is a far trickier problem to solve and requires advanced capabilities in the chosen SSL solution that allows it to selectively choose what to inspect and what to ignore. This functionality has gone from a “nice-to-have” to a requirement as the different regional PII laws have come into place.\nIf this were the end of the data-in-motion protection story it would be complex enough, but it is not. Just like any other arms race (and cyber security is an arms race), the speed of adoption and complexity of said security is increasing exponentially. Most of us lived through the 1K to 2K key upgrade approximately two years ago. We got to see how that change affected our servers and other equipment performance (it was also recent enough that we remember). We had to make that change because the algorithms were no longer complex enough. Changes like this have always happened, but seldom at this pace. We are on the cusp of the second major SSL algorithm change in just three years, and given recent history, it’s likely there will be another within the next five years. The interesting thing about these SSL changes is that they are being driven by markets in general. Companies have to follow suit or be left behind. If, for example, TLS1.3 in its current form becomes the standard, everyone will have to change their SSL algorithm from RSA to ECC because RSA is not currently supported in the TLS1.3 standard. This change, like the change to 2K keys, will affect the performance of everyone’s existing infrastructure.  The good news is that some corporations have built purpose-built solutions with a forward-thinking view to help mitigate the risk for these changes. If you are wondering where this problem affects you, there are four key areas to bear in mind.\n1) Server offload (the application exchanges keys with the client, one of the most resource-intensive functions that takes place for the server point of view).\n2) SSL inbound inspection for security visibility purposes (you can’t inspect what you can’t see).\n3) SSL outbound inspection for security visibility outbound (similar to above but usually closely tied to DLP and needs to have intelligence to not view PII data).\n4) SSL inspection upfront for DDOS protection. This sounds like #2 and #3, but remember SSL inspection is very resource-intensive, so having a solution that has intelligence built in to allow for limiting how much inspection has to take place is especially key in a DDoS environment, lest the SSL appliance become the most likely place to be DDOS’d.\nAvailability has always been a key tenant of what ADCs were meant to do, and it remains the key function that most ADCs offer. I believe we will see a renewed interest in using ADCs as a tool for testing appliances/applications that are running disparate code on scale out environments in order to decrease time to market, but reduce risk, i.e. if there is an unexpected bug, we can easily reroute the traffic without an outage.  If we were to extrapolate this to a very specific example, think about if you were migrating IS vendors. No need to cut over or run both in parallel, or run two units from the same vendor with different code.\nThe other key area is easy. Easy can mean so many things, but if you tie it to the ever-growing movement of agile development and Devops, we can hone in on several key areas one should consider.  First, ease of procurement. Can I call up a partner and get an easy-to-understand quote? Are payment arrangements flexible, capex or OPEX? Can I buy in cloud marketplaces? Do templates exist for setup? Can I have a fully managed solution? If I want to manage it myself, is automation supported natively for set up and management? Is there a native framework that supports operational automation? Are there tools and components that save time for developers like HTTP2 gateways, application optimization tools, SLA management features and built-in web application security functions like web application firewall and authentication gateways?\nUltimately the world is changing quickly, with web applications at the center of this change. As a result, we need to do what we can to meet the challenges in the most effective way.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'Application Delivery Controller\', \'Encryption\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/06/ssl-inspection/');

For additional DDoS protection and web application essentials, you can also take a look at our ERT Alert: BrickerBot PDoS Attack: Back With A Vengeance.\n [You might also like: 5 Recommendations for IoT Manufacturers]\nBrickerBot only attacks compromised devices\nScared yet? As long as IoT devices stay clean from any of the known IoT bots, there is no reason to fear the BrickerBot. In this blog, Pascal shares the results of his research into how Brickerbot might identify and target victims. He also looks at how to detect compromised devices.\nHajime – Sophisticated, Flexible, Thoughtfully Designed and Future-Proof\nOn Oct 16th, Sam Edwards and Ioannis Profetis from Rapidity Networks published a report on a new malware they discovered and named “Hajime.” The report came in the aftermath of the release of the Mirai source code and Mirai’s attacks on Krebs and OVH. While Brickerbot was stealing the headlines, Hajime was still a subject many researchers were studying and analyzing, trying to determine its purpose and the intentions of its author. No attacks have been attributed to Hajime, but it is sophisticated, well designed and flexible enough to be repurposed quickly. In this blog, Pascal looks at the potential of Hajime and the future of IoT botnets.\nThe offspring of two comic book giants bring us the Bot Squad! Super freaky!\nRadware’s Carl Herberger likens some of the nefarious threat actors to comic book giants. The world of IoT bots and cyber security are giving birth to amazing characters in particular, AraknoiD, the j3ster and the janit0r. In this blog, Carl looks at these three individuals, as they make up a virtual “Bot Squad.”\n\nFrom BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks\nWhen BrickerBot was discovered, it was the first time we’ve seen a botnet that would destroy an IoT device, making it unusable. So what does this mean for the future of connected devices? Radware’s David Hobbs explores that question in this blog post, along with his predictions for the future of PDoS attacks.\nConclusion\nWith the growing use of IoT devices, we have to wonder: What if people’s homes become more and more permanently infected because of Phlashing attacks? David Hobbs speculates that that would be the next natural progression for botnets like Brickerbot. A vulnerability exists because most home users are not aware of the risks associated with these devices, and even the most advanced systems can be bypassed and evaded by malware. Our hope is that the manufacturers of these products will take steps to better secure existing and new products. If not, we will be left to rely on grey hat vigilantes like the author of Brickerbot.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Brickerbot\', \'Hajime\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'malware\', \'PDoS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/06/everything-about-brickerbot-hajime-iot-botnets/');

Then, the uCPE automatically connects to the orchestration and provisioning systems, auto-downloads the basic configuration SW and downloads the VNFs (let’s say SD-WAN, Firewall and DDoS) automatically based on the service package purchased by the enterprise. The CPE sets up the service chain for the purchased services and then begins to operate. All of this is completed without a truck roll or operations personnel working on site.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (129, 'ISP DDoS Protection May Not Cover All of Bases', 'David Hobbs', '2017-5-25', 'Most organizations cannot rely solely on on-premise solutions because of the volumetric aspects of DDoS attacks. Multi gigabit-sized attacks cause on-premise connection lines to fill up, and organizations to go offline. Vulnerabilities with CDNs also has limitations for organizations. On-premise and cloud-based solutions offer protections that most ISPs are not able to deliver effectively. Some ISP’s have much better detection and DDoS mitigation capabilities, and next-generation offerings may include WAF and DDoS automation and integration. Every ISP is different and actual protections will vary over time and with vendors.\n\n\nReasons Why an ISP May Not be Able to Provide Full Protection\n1. Many examples demonstrate that an organization can be a victim of collateral damage when the ISP fails during massive DDoS campaigns. Even when outsourcing to specialty providers like DYN for DNS, total outages are possible. Latency becomes an issue when your ISP is fighting off DDoS attacks of larger volumes. If your ISP has 100Gbps of total bandwidth and takes on 80Gbps worth via DDoS attacks, what happens to your organization if you are NOT consuming DDoS services from them?\n2. The ISP does not know your applications, so how can it profile web and app-based applications? Does it know normal HTTP, HTTPS and APPbased rates and normal behaviors? Unless it commits to doing a full proxybased WAF offering, legitimate users will be blocked during an attack. This does not take into account SSL and other encrypted protocols, which require escrow certificates and keys with the ISP. Many organizations have compliance requirements that prevent something along these lines, especially with noncompliant ISP’s.\n3. SSL Encryption is a norm for most applications. To effectively combat SSL DDoS attacks, mitigation requires some level of SSL inspection. Only one OEM has patented asymmetric SSL protection. SSL “proxy” or always-on decryption is a very latency-expensive proposition, and thus on-premise equipment only allows for “under attack” SSL challenge response. Other methods that use always-on SSL proxy style mitigation introduce a lot of latency or are extremely expensive for overprovisioning. This also causes issues with compliance if the payload is inspected in SSL-proxy mode.\n4. Many ISPs ‘blackhole’ traffic by routing it away from the intended target so its uplink capacity is not exceeded. However, this blocks traffic indiscriminately, effectively blocking off websites or apps. Roughly, 50% of ISPs utilize this method at one time or another.\n [You might also like: Why ISP DDoS Services Typically Fail]\n5. Burst attacks are short-lived DDoS attacks where the attacker knows that a DDoS “scrub” or traffic diversion will be put in place. Average time to mitigation with ISPs is over 15 minutes. Short burst attacks can be very damaging to environments, and by the time the ISP responds to the attack, it could be over (only to return again shortly). This method of attack has become common because of ISP scrubbing methods.\n6. Even if your organization isn’t paying for DDoS services, is it paying for bandwidth expansions because of DDoS being a normal way of life? Many ISP’s pass the buck to customers by expanding bandwidth capabilities. Prices could reflect this expansion of bandwidth, even if you don’t buy into this business model. The question to ask is: are they consuming new circuits from tier 1 providers who have the fastest circuit, or have they expanded with lower grade circuits for DDoS attacks? How would the latency of your applications be affected if their emergency circuits are utilized?\n7. ISPs are typically local to your physical geography. This means the attack generally has to come to your ISP’s network before they can scrub it. In larger scale attacks, this can disrupt their upstream ISPs and interconnects between countries. This can result in upstream ISPs blackholing legitimate traffic to protect their links, and thus impacting legitimate users. Global DDoS scrubbing uses larger networks, which can stop the attack before the ISP sacrifices your traffic to maintain their transit customers.\n8. Multiple ISPs – more than one ISP, you must buy services from all of them and they are not coordinated. The more ISPs that are used, the bigger the problem becomes. Finding effective strategies to deal with DDoS attacks and getting accountability between competing ISP vendors becomes a major challenge.\n9. Asymmetric scrubbing center models are generally how an ISP handles an attack, but protection from, certain kinds of attacks can be severely limited because they aren’t seeing the full conversation. This leads to overmitigation and false positives. Asymmetric issues compound with use of multiple ISPs.\n10. Brute force DDoS attacks and BotNet scrubbing attacks are generally not considered “DDoS” from ISP levels. The ISP may be completely blind to brute force attacks that consistently lock out legitimate users, or application- based botnet attacks that challenge applications. Imagine a hotel chain with all rooms placed on booking holds for 24 hours, every day. The same scenario happens with e-Commerce providers with inventory and shopping carts, airlines and railways with tickets, etc.\n11. Default ISP detection mechanism is based on Netflow. Neflow detection works based on thresholds, and typically if the pipe is 1Gbps. Typical enterprise threshold are TCP 90% (within TCP let’s say 75% Http, 20% Https) and 8% UDP and 2% ICMP. With this threshold approach, many of the low & slow attacks are bypassed and damage customer infrastructure.\n12. Lack of certifications – ISPs do not have certifications like ICSA and NSS Labs for DDoS and WAF.\nISPs Are Only Concerned with the Link, Not the Applications\n\nISP/Telco DDoS Scrubbing vs. Radware Hybrid-Enabled Cloud Scrubbing\n\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"ISP DDoS Protection May Not Cover All of Bases\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/05/isp-protection-may-not-cover-all-bases/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"David Hobbs\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \" https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/isp-ddos-mitigation.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1282,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-05-25\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-05-25\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'Internet\', \'ISP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/05/isp-protection-may-not-cover-all-bases/');

For more than a millennium, Byzantium had remained a bastion of the Orthodox faith, the great kingdom of the East. The hordes and barbarians that had caused the downfall of so many other empires had been unable to conquer this unconquerable city. Until one day when it all changed.\nThere are many reasons why Mehmed was able to break the great states’ formidable defenses, and why with this empiric victory an Empire that had stood for almost 2,000 years was no more. If you look back in history, the seeds of destruction were sewn years before and the cities’ betrayal by the Fourth Crusade and Richard the Lionheart’s followers did not help. However, the key to this unlikely event was the development of firearms, specifically the artillery. The Byzantium’s knew about it but were either unable or unwilling to change their defensive strategy to account for it. The walls that had withstood all the Huns, Bulgars and various Muslim empires could throw at them crumbled as did the defensive towers that formed the second line of defense. The problem wasn’t the will of the defenders to fight or the maintenance of those walls, it was the failure to acknowledge the risk the new threat posed, the failure to change a defensive strategy that had been successful for over a thousand years.\nThis crossroads is where we find ourselves in the changing world of commerce and industry today. The shift to a digital world is only accelerating. There are multiple reasons for this, and to some of us the cons of this move are so obvious. They should be obvious to everyone.\n\nI believe the two key reasons for the shift, and most would agree, are convenience/access and price.  Convenience is a state of mind and doesn’t mean the same thing to everyone. For example, I will buy any and every commodity I can online (as long as I don’t need it right now), however I wouldn’t consider making a house purchase online without seeing the house in person (unless there were mitigating circumstances). In other words, what’s convenient can change. There are several factors that influence what convenience is. They are no different in the digital world, and in the physical world we often forget that everything in the digital world maps to something in the physical world. Sometimes we think there is no direct correlation but that’s only because the digital world hasn’t matured to the point where it has a one-to-one equivalent yet, but it will and it is.\n [You might also like: Cloud WAF: Why a Checkbox Isn’t Enough]\nA good target industry for illusion purposes is retail. It is no secret that online retailers are growing at a much faster rate than their brick and mortar counterparts. Many traditional retailers are in fact shrinking. However, I think this trend will eventually slow down and maybe even reverse. Today it is an uneven playing field. Online retailers are not hamstrung with the same cost basis as a brick and mortar store. This is changing and it is changing quickly. Remember my original premise that nothing in the digital world exists without a physical world equivalent. In some cases the change is a change in how business is done, i.e. Amazon opening regional distribution centers (becoming more brick and mortar-like). In other cases it’s having to add more digital security (alarm systems, security guards, security tags in the clothing, video surveillance) follow more compliance (building codes, health inspections, fire codes, etc.) have more redundancy (multiple locations) or have better performance (location).\nChange in the digital arena started years ago but is gathering steam and importance. Over the past 10 years we have seen the rise of compliance and regulation (PCI, HIPPA, NERC etc.) that have increased cyber security readiness and stability. However, this is/was just the beginning. The digital world always follows the physical world. PII data laws have been coming out fast and furious, and it is our belief that the IT infrastructure will ultimately be subject to the equivalent of building codes (today there are IT frameworks that can be very comprehensive, but they are not enforced). As our economy, our wellbeing, and indeed our very lives continue to rely on technology more and more, frameworks need to make way for enforced compliance.\nMost of us will cringe at the idea that forced compliance can exist in our relatively free digital world, but when do risks outweigh the benefits? If you see this future in the same light as we do, then it is incumbent upon us as IT professionals, and in many cases a business leader, to take pre-emptive steps to be in control of our companies’ own destiny.\nTaking pre-emptive action in this case is not as complicated as one would think. We can always use an existing framework (ITIL COBIT etc. ) in order to say that we are doing our due diligence, and there are numerous tools in place to help audit our practices and make sure that the framework remains in place and updated. Alternatively, we can take a simpler approach and map all components in our digital environment to those things that exist in the physical world. Then do a gap analysis vs the physical world. This, while by no means being a comprehensive approach, would help give us a basis for building a solution and saying that we have taken due care in ensuring we have built a robust environment to meet standard business needs.\nWe all have a choice; be like the Romans and pretend that the defenses/systems that have protected us since time immemorial are good enough, or evolve and stay ahead of the curve. We can and should expect more from our technology partners and we should be looking for companies that recognize this evolution. We believe that a comprehensive approach to technology as opposed to bolt-on functionality is the way to go when possible. The key is to find organization that have asked the question from the customers’ point of view and make round pegs for round holes. Organizations that have a mission and a focus area can expand their core capabilities, but this expansion is always in place to enhance the company’s core messaging and solutions.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'digital\', \'digital transformation\', \'digitization\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/05/every-digital-yin-has-physical-yang/');

BrickerBot reacts to an exploit attempt by scanning the source of the exploit for a set number of ports, trying to secure the device (assumption based on Janit0r statements) and if not able to, ultimately attempting to brick the device using exactly 90 brick sequences over the telnet session.\nAs long as IoT devices stay clean from any of the known IoT bots, there is no reason to fear the BrickerBot. While Hajime might have the best of intentions and is trying to proactively protect IoT devices from known malicious bots, it inadvertently will trigger the wrath of BrickerBot.\n\n\nFirst contact\nOur first contact with BrickerBot was on March 20th. A total of 1,895 PDoS attempts rolled by in little over four days. Then BrickerBot was gone, and while we knew little about the origin of the attempts, Catalin Cimpanu was able to get in touch with the author, going by the name ‘Janit0r.’ It was not until April 10th that we got a new, more intense visit from BrickerBot on another honeypot. 1,293 PDoS attempts in less than 15 hours. Two different honeypots, not immediately correlated except for running the same honeypots.\nIn the meantime, the Janit0r made some statements that kept resonating in our minds. In his first interview with Catalin, the Janit0r said that ‘the Radware writeup made BrickerBot sound simplistic’ and that ‘if security researchers … hosted their honeypots on dirtier networks they would find even more interesting things going on…’ Soon after that first interview, Catalin got tipped by the Janit0r about an outage that affected Sierra Tel customers in the cities of Mariposa and Oakhurst, California. In that article, the Janit0r said ‘BrickerBot was active on the Sierra Tel network at the time their customers reported issues, but their modems had also just been mass-infected with malware.’ The Janit0r suggested the other culprit was Mirai.\nIt was not until last week, while correlating honeypot data with blocked infection attempts from dynamic analysis of Hajime in our IPS logs and looking for new patterns that we started to see some evidence of how BrickerBot might identify and target victims. There is no evidence of active scanning before the attacks, at least not from the same devices that were used during the attacks.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot.3: The Janit0r is back, with a vengeance]\nHow to detect compromised devices?\nFrom the BrickerBot data, it became apparent that a limited number of devices performed attacks, and most of them did exactly 90 of them and subsequently disappeared. The number 90 was even more apparent in the second BrickerBot wave. One big question remained: how does it detect infected devices? The answer was in front of us all the time, we just looked over it. Our honeypots are built to listen on known exploit ports, so what if BrickerBot did the same? What if it is passively detecting exploit attempts by botnets such as the Mirai variants and Hajime? Instead of actively scanning the internet for new victims, it could just be listening on port TCP/23 (telnet) and port TCP/7457 (TR069) for scans from infected IoT devices. This technique is more efficient and stealthier compared to actively scanning most of the internet from each device.\nDial 23 for BrickerBot\nUsing one of the more recently discovered BrickerBot source IP addresses, we performed a TCP connection test on port TCP/23. The connection got established and was immediately closed by the server. Within seconds, the honeypot deployed on the same internet connection started revealing BrickerBot sequences from the same BrickerBot source IP we just dialed. The same BrickerBot kept attacking until it reached exactly 90 attempts and then left.\nFurther testing of several BrickerBot infected devices from previous attack waves showed that more ports are open. Telnet to port 7547 and 19058 consistently triggered the BrickerBot attacks, which makes us believe that the bot is listening on most of the known ports used by IoT bot exploits.\nUpon poking a BrickerBot, it comes back with 190 probes to 22 different ports, all of them corresponding to ports known to be exposed or used in exploits on IoT devices.\nFigure: BrickerBot probed ports\nSlightly different brick sequence\nA slightly different sequence was seen in most of the new BrickerBot brick attempts. This might have to do changes in our honeypot code or improved BrickerBot code by Janit0r.\nFigure: New commands in brick sequence\nNotice new commands ‘mtd_write erase mtdX’ and the omission of ‘&’ in the last erase command. Assuming this is not erratic behavior, as per Janit0r’s statement “The bot’s every action has a statistically determined purpose and what might’ve seemed like buggy behavior in the honeypot really isn’t.”\n [You might also like: BrickerBot – The Dark Knight of IoT]\nWhat we know\nFor now, we know that BrickerBots operate in a larger botnet and that they are silent until poked. The passive detection allows BrickerBots to operate independently of each other, without a need for command and control (C2) servers.\nThe attack sequences change between waves, indicating adaptive behavior and more effective brick sequences depending on the victims’ hardware, software and/or state. The ‘sysctl’ commands to disable TCP timestamps and reduce the max kernel threads are consistent and do provide a signature allowing identification and detection of the BrickerBot.\nThe BrickerBot botnet is globally distributed and we were able to identify 223 active nodes. Using Shodan.io and zoomeye.org queries, it appears that nearly all devices are running an older version of the Dropbear SSH server and most seem to have outdated firmware, some with hostnames ‘HACKED-ROUTER-HELP-SOS-DEFAULT-PASSWORD’ and ‘HACKED-ROUTER-HELP-SOS-WAS-MFWORM-INFECTED’ indicating the devices known to be vulnerable.\nFigure: Geographic distribution of BrickerBot – 1 dot = 1 bot, 223 bots in total\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Brickerbot\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/05/brickerbot-attacks-compromised-devices/');

Letâs revisit some plausible cyberattack profiles or scenarios that we predicted at the end of 2016:\n1. 2017 will see the Rise of Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) as a serious consideration for data center and IoT operations:\nPDoS has been around for a long time; however, it only shows itself spectacularly to the public from time to time, most recently in the form of Brickerbot. Some other examples include how a USB exploit can be inserted into a computer and render a computer bricked, and a tool uncovered by HP Labs called PhlashDance that was leveraged to find vulnerabilities in often forgotten firmware and binaries that sit localized on computing devices.\nThere have been a lot of other examples where PDoS is becoming more of reality and reports are picking up, such as this one, to be focused on physical hardware performance leading to permanent shutdowns. There is also a rising concern, especially from the consumer electronic disaster of the Samsung Notes 7 device, of devices which can be maliciously set on fire.\nSo, what else should we be looking at as we continue on through 2017?\n\nIoT devices have exploits which can âjumpâ through the air to other devices and render them inoperable:\nSmart TVs have a PDoS Malware âBrickâ problem\nBotnets leveraged for PDoS / Bricking\n\n2. Telephony DoS (TDoS) will rise in level of sophistication and importance and many will be caught by surprise on this threat vector:\nCutting off communications during crisis periods can impede first respondersâ situational awareness, exacerbate suffering and pain and might increase the loss of life. A digital event of our time could consist of a physical attack, with a corresponding cyberattack component that targets the communications systems first responders use to contain and minimize damage.\nCan the day be far away where efforts such as these are a reality? This bulletin issued in 2013 by public safety organizations asked for assistance in cracking a Telephony Denial-of-Service (TDOS) attack against 911 systems.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot â The Dark Knight of IoT]\nSo, what else should we be aware of as we move into the rest of 2017?\n\nMassive cyber-attacks against 911 emergency response systems, like the attack on the 9-1-1 call centers of 12 states, and the arrest of a man who tweeted out a link that took over cell phones to flood 9-1-1 call centers in Phoenix.\nSeeing the vulnerability of these national call centers to attack, Sens. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., will introduce a bill to federally fund and hasten the national transition to next generation 911 (NG911) systems.\nWhatsApp is also vulnerable, as evidenced by this video showing how to crash the app.\n\n3. Ransom attacks become more segmented and more real. In 2017 – Ransom is not just for companies anymore.\nA) Ransom attacks to personal implanted health devices Â \nRansom is the fastest growing motive and technique in cyber-attacks, which could be life-threatening to those who have implantable health devices that are also at risk of being hacked. For those of you unfamiliar with these risks and U.S. Government-issued warnings in this category, please refer to the FDAâs Advice to Medical Device Manufacturers, a summary of FBI & DHS alerts on Internet of things, and these warnings on Cyber-Ransoming.\nB) Ransom of public transportation systemsÂ -In many ways, the ultimate hack – – the ability to hold hostage a community for criminal gain.\nWe all inherently understand that from trains, planes, buses to automobiles, our entire public transportation system is becoming more automated. Ironically, this automation is meant to provide us with increased safety, more reliable service and efficiencies.Â  But is it really providing those things? There have already been many attacks, some of which have distinguished themselves as harbingers of future attacks categories. In case you missed it, I have pointed out four real world examples which help punctuate the problem through example.\nIf transportation systems are vulnerable, could ransoming of these systems be far behind?\nC) Ransom of military devicesÂ \nThe military has long been big users of technology.Â  But with technology, particularly Internet of Things devices, come risks.Â  Once demonstrable vulnerabilities are validated, how much would the U.S. Government pay to say, regain control of a weapon?\nWhat else should we be aware of?\n [You might also like: From BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks.]\n\nAs most people know, the Bay-Area-Transit (BART) train system was cyber ransomed just as our original. predictions were hitting the newswire.\nRansomware hits political infrastructure hard â the computer systems of Pennsylvaniaâs Senate Democrats was shut down after a ransom cyber-attack\nDrones also need to be taken into account when it comes to ransomware\nHealthcare medical devices are increasingly being attacked for ransom\n\n4. Darknet Goes Mainstream – Including the Ability to cause Personal Financial, Health, Education and other personal Record Integrity Issues\nToday on the Darknet one has easy and affordable access to terrorize or otherwise alter oneâs personal âavatarâ or others for financial or other benefits.

On the morning of Friday May 12th, a ransomware campaign began targeting computers around the world. Once a computer was infected, a worm replicated itself across the network, targeting other computers as well. Worms use a computer network to propagate to other machines and infect them with the malicious payload.\n\nThe payload in this event contained what is known as ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to user data by encrypting the files on an infected computer. Once the files are encrypted the attacker demands the victim pay a ransom for the decryption key.\n\nThis campaign has spread itself across networks leveraging recently disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s SMB service. MS17-010, a Microsoft security update issued on March 14th, addressed and patched these remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s SMB services.\nCVE’s patched in Microsoft’s security bulletin, MS17-010:\n\nCVE-2017-0143\nCVE-2017-0144\nCVE-2017-0145\nCVE-2017-0146\nCVE-2017-0147\nCVE-2017-0148\n\nThese exploits were disclosed in April when The Shadow Brokers leaked the Equation Groups’ software, which included FuzzBunch. FuzzBunch is an exploitation framework similar to Metasploit. Inside of the FuzzBunch framework there are many remote exploits for Windows like EternalBlue and DoublePulsar which are being used in the current WannaCrypt campaign.\nIt was feared by many researchers that the Shadow Brokers’ dump would be used by criminals to target future victims. This fear became a reality later in April when researchers started noticing a backdoor from the Shadow Brokers’ dump called DoublePulsar infecting computers around the world.\nThe DoublePulsar SMB plant from the Shadow Brokers’ dump is a backdoor exploit. In the month of April, DoublePulsar infected close to 200,000 computers. This backdoor gives the attacker a persistent foothold in the victim’s computer and can be used to distribute malware, send spam, or launch attacks. EternalBlue is a remote code exploit affecting Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nAttackers are also using the EternalBlue vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and propagate WannaCrypt to other computers on a targeted network.\n\nIt appears the attackers are using publicly available tools like Fuzzbunch from the Shadow Brokers’ dump or Metasploit to run this campaign. On Github you can find the exploits, payloads and scanners needed to launch an attack against a computer using a number of vulnerabilities found in MS17-010.  The author behind the current campaign combined WannaCrypt with the delivery method of abusing a vulnerability in Microsoft’s SMB service for infection. This campaign targeted anyone who did not update their devices after Microsoft released patches for the vulnerabilities in security update MS17-010.\nUpon infection, WannaCrypt executes a file that sends an HTTP GET request to a hard coded domain. This is a kill switch. If the request for the domain is successful, WannaCrypt will exit and not deploy.  If the request fails, then it continues to carry out infecting the device and others on the network.\nWhen the campaign began on Friday, a security researcher, @MalwareTechBlog, noticed the kill switch domain was unregistered. He promptly registered the domain and directed the request to a sinkhole, effectively preventing this variant from spreading further.\nKill switches\n\niuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com (@MalwareTechBlog)\nifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com (@msuiche)\n\nAfter dropping the first executable and checking the domain for the kill switch, WannaCrypt will drop another executable to scan the IP addresses and attempt to connect to vulnerable devices via the SMB vulnerability on port 445. If there is another vulnerable device on the network, the worm will make the connection and transfer the malicious payload to that device as well.\nOver the weekend two other variants appeared: One that had the kill switch removed but failed to infect its targets with WannaCrypt, and the other had a new kill switch domain. This variant was successfully targeting other computers. This discovery was made by @benkow_ and @msuiche registered the domain. Once the domain was registered, he pointed it to a sinkhole to prevent it from spreading as well.\nThe Tor client is also embedded inside of WannaCrypt. The Tor client is installed on the infected machine so it can receive the encryption keys from the hidden c2 servers on the Tor network.\n\ngx7ekbenv2riucmf.onion\n57g7spgrzlojinas.onion\nxxlvbrloxvriy2c5.onion\n76jdd2ir2embyv47.onion\ncwwnhwhlz52maqm7.onion\n\nOnce infected, WannaCrypt users are presented with a notice that their files have been encrypted and demand the victims to pay a ransom of $300 in Bitcoin. Three days after the infection, the ransom increases to $600. When the clock expires after seven days, the victim loses the ability to pay the ransom and decrypt their files. The files on the infected computers are encrypted using a custom AES-128 in CBC mode. At the time of writing, 194 payments totaling $53,453.58 have been made to the Bitcoin wallets hard coded into this version of WannaCrypt.\n [You might also like: Ransom, Ransom Everywhere]\nWannaCrypt\nWannaCrypt BTC wallets:\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/12t9YDPgwueZ9NyMgw519p7AA8isjr6SMw\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/115p7UMMngoj1pMvkpHijcRdfJNXj6LrLn\n\nAt the moment there are no confirmed reports of victims receiving a key for decryption after making a payment. Normally ransomware campaigns have personalized BTC wallets to help identify who has paid the ransom. In the case of WannaCrypt, it’s believed the only way to identify to the author that you have made a payment is by sending the extortionist your transaction ID through their Contact Us section. The current version in circulation is WannaCrypt 4.0.\nFiletypes that WannaCrypt targets for encryption\nThis outbreak highlights an evolution in ransomware attacks. No longer does a malware author have to target large swaths of the population via a phishing campaign with the hopes that someone opens an infected document. With the WannaCrypt campaign leveraging EternalBlue, it shows that ransomware is evolving and leveraging different vectors of attack. With this method the author only has to target one vulnerable computer on the network. Once that device is infected, the ransomware will worm across the network, compromising other vulnerable computers.\nUsers should immediately patch their computers with the latest security updates from Microsoft. MS-17-010 will include the patch for this vulnerability. Microsoft has even pushed an update for Windows XP, which hasn’t seen an update since it went out of support in 2014. Users who cannot update should disable SMBv1 from allowing direct connections. To do this, open Windows features and uncheck the box “SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support.”\nWindows Feature\nIn addition, users should get into the habit of creating backups so in the event they do lose data, all is not lost. Ransom-based attacks are on the rise, and businesses face a growing threat from these financially-driven cyber assaults that hold their data or services hostage. In general, these attacks come in two primary “flavors.” Ransomware and DDoS-for-Ransom. In a DDoS-for-Ransom campaign an attacker will send their victims a letter threatening to attack their organization—rendering its business, operations or capability unavailable—unless a ransom is paid by the deadline. If a ransom is not paid, the attacker will take their target offline with a volumetric denial-of-service attack. In either case companies and users are advised not to pay an extortionist and to seek professional help when needed.\n\nDownload the “Cyber Ransom Survival Guide: The Growing Threat of Ransomware and RDoS – and What to Do About It” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\', \'Wannacrypt\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/05/wannacrypt/');

In other words, as soon as businesses build or strengthen a protective barrier, the “bad guys” find another way to get in. Attackers are constantly changing their tactics and strategies to make their attacks and scams as damaging as possible.  The good news is that it appears that attacks and subsequent defenses are breaking down in categories which can be measured systematically. The following areas are of a particular concern as we look towards 2017-2018 planning for attacks:\n\n\n1. Real-Time Protection Against Volumetric Attacks:\n According to Wikipedia, volumetric attacks are defined as the following: “involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, such that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered effectively unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. In general terms, DoS attacks are implemented by either forcing the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consuming its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately.”  We have seen a dramatic rise in the growth of these attack types, and even more ominous is the procurement of more capable ‘weapon systems’ or new application-based tools from which attacks can be launched. The following is a list to consider when making certain you are covering your bases in this category: \na.	TCP SYN floods\nb.	TCP SYN+ACK floods\nc.	TCP FIN floods\nd.	TCP RESET floods\ne.	TCP Fragment floods\nf.	TCP STOMP floods\ng.	Valve Source Specific Floods – Mirai\nh.	DNS Waterfall Attacks – Mira\ni.	GRE IP floods – Mirai\nj.	GRE Ethernet floods – Mirai\nk.	UDP Family of floods\nl.	ICMP Family of floods\nm.	IGMP Family of floods\nn.	Packet Anomalies\no.	Known DoS tools\n2. Application Layer (L7) Availability Protections: \nMalware is morphing in scale, scope and delivery payloads.  It has managed to renew itself as a top concern related to protecting your organization and has emerged as an imminent threat to Organizational Availability. In fact, attackers have shifted away from mass distribution of a small number of threats to micro distribution of large families of threats. These new strains of malware consist of millions of distinct threats that mutate as they spread rapidly.  In this category, the following is a list of attacks worthy of considering when choosing protection mechanisms for your enterprise:\nReal-time protection against: \na.	Bot-originated and direct application attacks – Non-IoT\nb.	Iot Bot Attacks\nc.	HTTP GET page floods\nd.	HTTP POST floods\ne.	Customized / Additional HTTP Method attacks\nf.	HTTP uplink bandwidth consumption attacks\ng.	DNS query floods (A, MX, PTR…)\nh.	Brute Force Attacks (HTTP, Telnet, POP3, SSH, IMAP, etc.,) – Brickerbot, Mirai & Haijme IoT Attacks\nAdvanced behavioral application monitoring:\ni.	HTTP servers real time statistics and baselines\nj.	DNS server real time statistics and baseline\n3. Data-Center Services Behavioral Protections: \n Trusted Web sites are the focus of a large portion of malicious activity.   As more and more users go online to take advantage of Web 2.0 applications — like social networking sites, blogs, and wikis — authors of ‘hacking and cracking’ software are right behind them, opening up yet another front in the constant cat-and-mouse game between security defenses and hackers.  These threats will become increasingly important with younger workforces who are proficient with these tools.  To thwart these attack types, consider very strong protections against these categories of attacks or threats:\na.	HTTP servers\nb.	Web vulnerability scans\nc.	Bruteforce\nd.	SIP servers (TCP & UDP)\ne.	SIP spoofed floods\nf.	Pre-SPIT activities\ng.	SIP scanning\nh.	SMTP/IMAP/POP3, FTP, etc.\ni.	Application Bruteforce\nj.	Application scans\n [You might also like: The offspring of two comic book giants bring us the Bot Squad! Super freaky!]\n 4. IPS & Reputation Services:\n The continued high volume of hacktivist attacks underscored the importance of various signature prevention technologies to prevent proper exploitation of an evolving tool landscape.  In fact, the heavy reliance on tools as part of hacktivist attacks have ironically exposed the over-reliance on the perimeter model of deployed security devices without IPS technologies on the VERY edge.  Most DDoS providers do not rely on signatures and frequently fail to uncover newly developed attack tools, and most IPS providers suggest deployments of their tools too deep in the infrastructure for them to be meaningful to stop attacks at the perimeter. The following is a shopping list of things to consider when procuring IPS & Reputational Management solutions to prevent perimeter attacks:  \nSignatures Protection against: \na.	Application vulnerabilities and exploits\nb.	IoT botnet protections\nc.	Web, Mail, DNS, databases, VoIP\nd.	OS vulnerabilities and exploits\ne.	Microsoft, Apple, Unix-based\nf.	Network Infrastructure vulnerabilities\ng.	Switches, routers and other network elements vulnerabilities\nh.	Malware\ni.	Worms, bots, Trojans and drop-points, Spyware\nj.	Anonymizers\nk.	IPv6 attacks\nl.	Protocol Anomalies \nSecurity Operation Center \nm.	 Leading vulnerability security research team\nn.	Weekly and emergency signature updates\n5. Network scanning and malware propagation protections:\n As mentioned above in the application-focused problem of bots and malware, the very same categorical problem exists at the network layer, however this time it is equally as important to protect the internal environment as well as the external in real time.  The following is a list of network protection considerations: \na.	Behavioral Real-time protection against Zero-Minute Malware Propagation and network scans:\nb.	UDP spreading worm detection\nc.	TCP spreading worm detection\nd.	High and low rate network scans\ne.	Scanning/spreading pattern identification\nf.	Infected source identification \n6. Encrypted Protections:\n  As mentioned above in the application-focused problem of bots and malware, these attacks can also be hidden in encrypted variants. The following is a list of encrypted -protection considerations: \na.	Ability to handle ALL SSL / TLS algorithms:\ni.	RSA\nii.	Diffie-Hellman (DH) Algorithms\niii.	Elliptical Curve (ECC)\nb.	Network-layer handshake protections and overflow considerations\nc.	Known SSL / TLS attack tool protections\nd.	Application-layer SSL flood protections\n7. Compliance Certifications:\na.	PCI – the gold standard in handling protected user-level financial information\nb.	GDPR – the new data protection standard for EU citizens worldwide\nc.	ISO 27001 – the standard for information security\nd.	IS0 27017 – the gold standard for cloud information security\ne.	EAL & ICSA Labs – the gold standard for component level security in CPE devices\nf.	NSS Labs Recommended – the gold standard for performance of vendor claims\n8. Enhance Service and at-time-need support: \n Cyber-attack protections are complicated and hard and often requires staff augmentation, the need for cloud-fail-over protection or augmentation needs.  The following is a list of considerations when selecting a Cyber Attack Mitigation Partner:\na.	Emergency Response Services – 24/7/365\nb.	On-Site ERT Services\nc.	Professional Services – worldwide\nd.	Depots – worldwide\ne.	Multi-lingual TAC support & worldwide\nf.	Cloud DDoS scrubbing centers which could offload peak loads on internal devices\ng.

It seemed like magic to me: A device that could compensate for bad coding or unexpected/unintended web application functionality. It could do this by learning expected application behavior and then enforcing said behavior, even if the application itself was capable of allowing the unwanted behavior. The business case for such a technology is easily recognizable even more so today than it was in the mid- to early 2000’s when it first came out: the ability to have a device compensate for human error.\n\nThe potential cost savings of this type of technology either in physical costs or brand protection is easily explainable. Consider for one second the cost a particular adult dating site has incurred; not due to actual funds being stolen but due to PR expenditures and legal fees associated with the hack. At the end of the day, we are all just human and yes we can fix errors when we find them, but sometimes things arenât even exploitable until they are. It is easy to see the value of a technology that can protect against this unknown risk.\n\nTo illustrate this unintended functionality risk letâs describe a simple SQL injection in the context of a story:\nThe year is 2003 and I have decided I want to break into your bank account. I donât know anything about you other than your name, your wealth, that you portray yourself as tech savvy and you bank at Wealthy Man Bank. So I open an account at Wealthy Man Bank too. I get online account access (if youâre tech savvy youâll be doing online banking) so I can see the syntax for the user name (now I know what your user name is). For argumentâs sake, letâs say it was first initial, last name. Knowing a user name doesnât get me in though, so nothing to worry about, right? Well, not quite true. I happen to be a budding SQL developer and I know that in the coding world 1=1 or a=a or 2=2 etc. means true. So in other words, I substitute this basic SQL statement for the for the password in the password field and voila! Iâm in, and all your money is gone (note this type of SQL attack would likely not work today because developers are generally smarter than that now).\nIn the above example the hacker tricked the application into doing something it wasnât programmed to do. This type of breach was recognized early on by the likes of the PCI-DSS council who decided to make secure code review and/or a WAF a requirement of credit card compliance in order to prevent it. Most organizations eventually chose to go the route of a WAF because although secure code review should be part of a best practice, it is usually a point-in-time static checkâ¦ and almost all code today is dynamic and ever changing. It doesnât help that we are human and we make mistakes. A true WAF, configured and managed correctly, solves that problem by enforcing only known good behavior. It has to have a positive and a negative enforcement architecture to truly achieve this.\nToday we are spoiled for choices when it comes to WAF. We have multiple options for on-prem or in the cloud WAF, and we also have several other devices like next-gen firewalls and some Proxy technologies that say they protect against the OWASP top 10 risks. What makes some stand apart from others and why do you still need a real WAF?\nFirst, letâs discuss what makes a WAF a WAF and where technology comes from. In the early days when companies like Terros first espoused this type of technology, our friends at Gartner labeled it as an IDS. The key thing that eventually differentiated it from and IDS/IPS with targeted OWASP signatures and still does is the ability to do positive application enforcement (enforce known good behaviors and block everything else). The WAF can and does have signatures, but the magic is in learning and enforcing the expected behavior. This official differentiation happened around the year 2006. The PCI-DSS council made their compliance requirement almost at the same time.\n [You might also like: WAF and DDoS â Perfect Bedfellows: Every Business Owner Must Read.]\nThe problem with a WAF then as it is now and has always been is that it is a very interactive product. Most other security devices are to some extent set and forget, but a WAF is always high touch. Every time the application changes I have to touch the WAF to avoid false positive âblocks.â To illustrate what I mean, if I add a new feature to an application, the WAF will block it if it hasnât seen it before and it should. A new feature would be unexpected behavior, a divergence from the baseline, so to speak. The only way to solve this is constant care and feeding. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the work or security team that runs the WAF donât actually write the application code. They have to see the error or false positive, then get hold of the development team, etc. Due to this complexity of management, we found the adoption of WAF outside of the PCI compliance realm rather stunted and the success rate of people using the WAF for more than a checkmark mixed.\nOver the past few years several changes have taken place in the WAF space. The biggest change has been the move to WAF as a service, both as a full SAAS offering and as a fully managed service. This change has been a boon for adoption as the complex setup and management has been greatly reduced. However, all is not as it seems. Remember the functionality that differentiated a WAF from an IPS or for that matter a next generation firewall, the ability to learn the application and enforce known good behavior? Well that doesnât exist in most Cloud WAFs. I would contend that in fact there are only two WAF-as-a-service companies that actually offer a true cloud âWAF.â Remember folks, just because you call something by a particular name doesnât make it so. What you get from the cloud hosting providers is often not a WAF, and what you get from anyone not offering positive enforcement capabilities is not a WAF.\nCompounding this obvious problem is the fact that most large enterprises are stuck in a hybrid architectural scenario, with some of the assets protected behind hard-to-manage on-prem devices and some in the cloud behind a service. Most players in this space offer either an appliance or a service, not both. Worse, when they do offer both itâs not the same technology. Most on-prem solution are to a greater or lesser extent a WAF. Most cloud WAFs are in fact IPSs with a signature set tuned to protect against the OWASP top 10 threats. The limitation of signatures is not the only problem. Itâs the fact that you will have to manage two different systems, pull reports form two different systems, etc. and not have a single point of contact from a support and management perspective.\nThe next-gen solutions that have come out over the past year have answered this challenge by offering a true WAF in the cloud that uses the same universal management and reporting console. On top of this, at least one Israeli-based organization offers a full managed services solution stack that covers both their physical appliances and their cloud SAAS offering. This allows organizations either transitioning to the cloud or who have a hybrid architecture to have a seamless experience. It also empowers organizations to now harness the full capabilities of a WAF, which were previously unattainable because of the high-touch, high-skill requirements.\nIn todayâs world where web attacks are becoming ever more common and the cost of these attacks when successful ever higher, it is not worth selecting a solution for its substance rather than its name. Especially when the solution is roughly the same price and globally available, and unmistakably alone in answering the customerâs true needs.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'Cyber Security\', \'WAF\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/05/cloud-waf-checkbox/');

Super freaky!', 'Carl Herberger', '2017-5-9', 'To state the obvious, two well-known comic book giants have lit the imaginations of generations of children. They brought to life the fantasy that humans could be ‘super’ or immortal, or somehow infallible.\nEach in their own way combined fantastical combinations of humans with unreal, unbelievable and incredible skills.\nIn the category of vision enhancement alone, there are legions of characters who have developed themselves in a surreal way, for example, through X-Ray vision, or super-acute vision (something akin to a hawk). Other superheroes were gifted with night vision or even eyes that fired deadly laser beams. However, did you know that these characters dreamt up in comic books all have somewhat real world equivalents? Well, maybe not in people, but clearly in video surveillance systems of the future.\n\nThese characters often blurred the lines between vigilantes and purveyors of good to having villainous tendencies or, at times were downright evil.\nIf you haven’t been following it, the world of Internet of Things (IoT) bots and cyber security are giving birth to amazing characters themselves which are often cloaked behind avatars, anonymous proxies and comfortable legal geographic domiciles.\n\nThe virtual worlds and characteristics have given them their fantasy world to be able to create, conduct and execute their vigilante, righteous, evil or just narcissistic desires as they see fit.\nIf you haven’t witnessed this yet, there is a long, long “perp” list of characters which have been taken into custody such as AKILL, Dark Dante, SoupNazi, the Homeless Hacker, etc., however let’s go with the most famous and add a few characters along the way to illustrate my point.\nLet’s consider these characters figures that work alone, but often seem to have similar values and joint enemies. Similar to a motley combination of surreal characters, let’s consider this the virtual “Bot Squad.” They use automated tools and techniques to take down their chosen enemies.\n \nth3j35t3r (the Jester) – the Digital Hero\nNo Bot Squad would be complete without the favorite of my geeks around the world – the infamous Jester. Now, I must caveat up front, that like Bigfoot, there have been many claimed sightings of Jester and many suggested known identities, however lore holds that he has still not been unmasked. Common belief is that the the Jester first appeared on Twitter, where he announced his attack on the Taliban website alemarah.info on January 1, 2010 and quickly thereafter established his WordPress blog “Jester’s Court.” The Jester also communicates via his I2P IRC channel #jester and cautions these are the only three authentic methods of communication from him: “As per usual, because of the large amount of imposters trying to pass themselves off as me I will only speak in THREE places, here via this blog, my twitter and the i2p IRC network outlined above where my nick (th3j35t3r) is registered to myself. If you see a ‘jester’ anywhere else it’s not me.”\n [You might also like: BrickerBot.3: The Janit0r is back, with a vengeance]\nTo be honest, I had what I believed to be a live chat session with the Jester at RSA back in 2012 during a time whereby his “contributions” to fighting some aspects of Wikileaks, TeamPoision and Lulzsec were much reported.\nAccording to the Jester, he has had stated that he was a former soldier and had served in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and many allegations have been made that he is a former defense contractor involved in U.S. Special Operations Command projects. In fact, many suggest that the Jester may not be a single person at all and is actually a group of people working as a form of a cybersecurity chaebol collective. In April of 2012, similar to the live session he had with me, the Jester gave a live chat interview to a class of Computer Science students at the University of Southern Maine where he confirmed his military service and stated he served four “operational tours.”\nThe Jester has many famous tool development claims, including the infamous XerXes DDoS tool. He claimed to have originally developed his DoS script as a means to test and harden servers, but after learning from an article that Jihadists were using the Internet to recruit and coordinate terror cells he weaponized his script.\nThe Jester has been known to have had many famous public battles with the likes of his nemesis Group Anon, Team Poison and Lulzsec among many others.\nArkanoiD – The St. Petersburg Hacking Club – A classic villain\nArkanoiD is closely linked to a St. Petersburg hacking collective that the infamous Vladimir Levin was reported to have been a part of. ArkanoiD’s story is like Ocean’s 11 or a digital Italian Job in real life. Allegedly (as he was never really convicted of the crime itself), Mr. Levin, working with three others, transferred a portion of $10.7M to his bank account from a handful of large Citibank accounts from all over the world—all while sitting in his apartment in St. Petersburg. Having said that, apparently gaining some inside information for $100, he didn’t use the Internet; instead he used telecommunications systems, and listened to customer phone calls to get their account numbers and PINs.\nAlthough ArkanoiD was unmasked by authorities, they were reportedly all but $400,000 from Levin’s theft after his accomplices gave him up when they were arrested. In 1998 he was ordered to pay back $240,000 to Citibank for a lesser charge and sentenced to three years in jail. His whereabouts are unknown today, however ArkanoiD is reportedly active from time to time.\nThis hack and the club has been romanced as there are now numerous games borrowing the name from the famous collective.\nThe Janit0r (the Janitor) – A new soldier?\nWhen one of my esteemed colleagues, Pascal Geenens, had discovered the now famous Brickerbot, he was tracking it for a few weeks and was amazed how this program attempted to kill devices in a seemingly relentless way. Since then we have witnessed numerous variants and have managed to replicate the effectiveness of the bot in a lab, and stood in awe as the bot essentially destroyed infected webcams and other IoT devices. They would not even respond to factory resets.\nThe Janit0r will go down, in my humble opinion, for building the first weapon of mankind designed to kill the machines which people are growing to hate en masse.\n [You might also like: From BrickerBot to Phlashing, Predictions for Next-Level IoT Attacks.]\nWho is the Janit0r? He is a hacker who has created multiple versions of a program called BrickerBot (also a name bestowed by my brethren at Radware), a system that searches out and bricks insecure IoT devices.\nThe devices all used a Linux package called BusyBox and had exposed telnet-based interfaces with default passwords. These devices were easily exploited by the Mirai botnet, which essentially turned them into denial-of-service weapons.\nBrickerBot finds these devices and renders them unusable. The first version attacked about a thousand devices and alternate versions attacked thousands more. It disabled the devices by formatting the internal memory.\nAccording to Bleeping Computer:\n“Like so many others I was dismayed by the indiscriminate DDoS attacks by IoT botnets in 2016. I thought for sure that the large attacks would force the industry to finally get its act together, but after a few months of record-breaking attacks it became obvious that in spite of all the sincere efforts the problem couldn’t be solved quickly enough by conventional means,” wrote the Janitor. “I consider my project a form of ‘Internet Chemotherapy;’ I sometimes jokingly think of myself as The Doctor. Chemotherapy is a harsh treatment that nobody in their right mind would administer to a healthy patient, but the Internet was becoming seriously ill in Q3 and Q4/2016 and the moderate remedies were ineffective.”\nThis sort of vigilante justice is fun and clever. If a user can’t secure their own systems, perhaps a bit of discriminate destruction is just what these things need to stop leaving admin passwords wide open.\nThis new tool gives arms to all of those displaced by automation and technology and who would like to act upon their frustrations by hitting back at the robots!\nThe Bots are coming!

It was a massive spoofed-IPs attack against the user authentication ports. After several attempts to mitigate the attack, the customer turned to a local cloud provider â who is a Radware partner – for help. As one the largest providers in APAC they took a stab at fighting the attack off, and called Radware to the battlefield.\n\n\nThis was sophisticated combat, as it turned out. The customer has experienced multi-vector attacks in varying rates and random bursts of hundreds of Gbps each peak. The vector blend was changing and it was clear that the attackers are not only determined to knock the service offline, but keep it down as well.\nFigure 1 â Traffic rates throughout the attack campaign\nFigure 2 â Traffic rates throughout the attack campaign\nWe gathered our Emergency Response Team (ERT) DDoS mitigation experts for a round-the-clock fight. This type of attack highlights the need to have experts on call in the moment of truth. The experience of a senior engineer pays off.\nAttack Characteristics â Why Spoofed IPs?\nThe attackers launched a sustained series of precise and high volume floods comprised of the following characteristics:\n\nProfessional â neither a novice hacker nor a plug-n-play DDoS-as-a-Service program carried out this attack campaign. The determination and methodic development of the campaign proved it to be a job done by networking experts.\nMultiple, constantly changing vectors – including SYN floods, ACK floods, UDP floods, TCP reset attacks and fragmented UDP floods on multiple ports simultaneously, in different blend compositions.\nGeographic distribution â to bypass any geo-location based protection\nBursts – A sustained high volume attack combined with high volume peaks every 5 to 15 minutes.\nSpoofed IPs â Most DDoS protection solutions use IP blacklisting mechanisms and cannot withstand a dynamic spoofed IPs attack. Not only these are limited by the capacity to store lists of IP addresses, in the case of constantly changing spoofed IPs, blacklisting â and ACL updates â are meaningless.\n\nThey probably expected the provider to drop the upstream router link at a certain high volume. But that didnât happen. Using a dedicated signature, we could block the malicious traffic regardless of its IP address.\nFigure 3 & 4 â Attack bursts of random durations every few minutes\n\nâMost DDoS Protection solutions use IP blacklisting mechanisms and cannot withhold a dynamic spoofed IPs attack. This is another indication that this campaign was launched by professionals who knew exactly how to breach through a typical cloud provider DDoS protectionâ\n [You might also like: Ask Yourself: Do I Need an Emergency Response Plan?

They made multiple network optimization actions and security tunings in order to control and manage the attack traffic, including network optimization actions to adjust to the attack volume and vectors. While the initial burst caused an interruption, it allowed us to refine the tunings further, resulting in an ultimate consistency of mitigation of nearly a 100% of the attack duration.\nFollowing the engagement of Radwareâs ERT, the burst attacks have become much more complex, frequent and of longer duration, presumably due to their recognized lack of success.\nAt the end of the day, there are three key elements in successful mitigation, where one cannot go without the other:\n\nThe technology â a behavioral analysis engine that detects anomalies in real time and protects legitimate users while blocking the attack traffic\nThe scrubbing capacity â a broad network of high capacity scrubbing centers in various locations. Yet. even an endless capacity cannot fully protect customer SLA without the ability to distinguish between attack traffic and legitimate requests\nThe human factor â against a team of sophisticated, determined professionals, you need a team of more sophisticated, devoted experts to win the cyber-battle\n\nThese subsequent bursts too, have been fully mitigated with no apparent or reported impact on game functionality â the SLA was protected!\nRadwareâs ERT remains on alert, believing the attackers will return with more sophisticated, aggressive tactics.\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud\', \'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/05/radware-mitigated-spoofed-ips-attack-of-several-hundred-gbps/');

This revolution is called the Internet of Things (IoT) and is transforming once-stodgy manufacturers into massive technology giants, old electric companies into the world’s largest interconnected network of lights, meters and transformer stations, and have the possibility to permeate nearly every aspect of our lives, including the ability to transform our love lives and the prospect of our health and quality of living.\n\nIronically, there is no uniform definition of the Internet of Things. It can be defined as the following from a technical perspective: Internet of Things is the network which can achieve interconnection of all things anywhere, anytime with complete awareness, reliable transmission, accurate control, intelligent processing and other characteristics by the supportive technologies, such as micro-sensors, RFID, wireless sensor network technology, intelligent embedded technologies, Internet technologies, integrated intelligent processing technology, and nanotechnology.\n\nSo given these massively disruptive changes, how does one foretell what skills will be the most in-demand as these old industries retool for tomorrow’s needs and new industries are given birth?\nAccording to the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union, the network architecture of IoT consists of five distinct layers:\n\nthe sensing layer\nthe access layer\nthe network layer\nthe middleware layer and\napplication layers.\n\nSensing layer: The main features of this layer are capturing the interest of information large-scale with various types of sensors, identifying intelligently, and sharing the captured information in the related units in the network.\nThe access layer: This layer’s main function is to transfer information from the sensing layer to the network layer through existing mobile networks, wireless networks, wireless LANs, satellite networks and other infrastructure.\nNetwork layer: This layer’s main function is to integrate the information resources of the network into a large intelligence network with the Internet platform, and establish an efficient and reliable infrastructure platform for upper-class service management and large-scale industry applications.\nThe middleware layer: This layer’s main function is to manage and control network information real-time, as well as providing a good user interface for upper layer application. It includes various business support platforms, management platforms, information processing platforms, and intelligent computing platforms.\nApplication layer: This layer’s main function is to integrate the function of the bottom system, and build the practical application of various industries, such as smart grids, smart logistics, intelligent transportation, precision agriculture, disaster monitoring and distance medical care.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot.3: The Janit0r is back, with a vengeance]\nIt’s anyone’s guess really on what will be the killer application and platform from which most of this new regime will be built, however early indications are that the IoT transformation will require deep cross-technology talent with a special focus on the following four broad areas:\n1. Networking (includes sensing)\n2. Applications & Automation (includes middleware)\n3. Data – especially Big Data\n4. Security\nLet’s see how each of these areas significantly depart from their traditional talent pools and understand what will be an acute focus item as the IoT world continues to grow.\nNetworking\nThere exists an almost bewildering choice of connectivity options for electronics engineers and application developers working on products and systems for the Internet of Things (IoT).\nFirst, much has been made about IoT running across Low Power Lossy Networks (LLN) exclusively.  For those of you not familiar, Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which both the routers and their interconnects are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and instability.  LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.  However the truth is that just some classes of more ‘sensor-like’ IoT devices are being planned for this type of network, and other IoT devices with more direct access to the internet are leveraging other more common or newer protocols.\nFor example, many communication technologies are well known such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and 2G/3G/4G cellular, but there are also several new emerging networking options such as Thread as an alternative for home automation applications, and Whitespace TV technologies being implemented in major cities for wider area IoT-based use cases. Depending on the application, factors such as range, data requirements, security and power demands and battery life will dictate the choice of one or some form of combination of technologies. These are some of the major communication technologies on offer to developers.\nHere are a number of communication protocols to watch for beyond normal IT communication protocols, which individuals can educate themselves on today:\n– Zigbee\n– Z-Wave\n– 6LowPAN\n– SigFox\n– Neul\n– NFC\n– LoRaWan\nOf course in the end, really understanding how devices can be communicated to in an efficient and reliable manner will be key! The more one understands the technologies listed above, the better chance they have of remaining relevant in today’s marketplace!\nApplications & Automation\nApplications are the heart and soul of how an IoT device is either used or deployed.\nApplications drive the use, efficiency, or novelty of the connected device.\nAlthough the debate will remain open for some time to come on what platforms for code writing will prove to be the largest adopted type, we can say for certain that automation will be a key element of the way IoT is deployed, managed and maintained.\nAutomation will most certainly mean technologies such as OpenStack and other SDN based automation systems along with Rest and SOAP API knowledge and the ability to code BOTS of all types.\nWhen it comes to code writing there are about ten different languages that float to the top of the consideration pool when it comes to programming embedded systems. They range from general-purpose languages like C++ and JavaScript to embedded-specific choices like Go and Parasail. Each offers advantages and disadvantages. After you’ve reviewed the following pages to see what we’ve come up with, meet us in the comments section below to let us know what your preferred language options are when you’re considering embedded and IoT development projects. The following is a powerful list to consider moving your knowledge base to:\n– C\n– C++\n– B#\n– Rust\n– JavaScript\n– Parasail\n– Forth\n– Go\n– Python\n– Assembler\nOf course in the end, these platforms all have pluses and minuses and were designed to solve some architectural problems in code writing. Gaining a powerful understanding of how each of these can be leveraged for the IoT community will be key! As with the networking technologies, the more one understands the technologies listed above, the better chance they have or remaining relevant in today’s marketplace!\nData Analytics – especially Big Data\nThe future of technology lies in data and its analysis. More objects and devices are now connected to the Internet, transmitting the information they gather back for analysis. The goal is to harness this data to learn about patterns and trends that can be used to make a positive impact on our health, transportation, energy conservation, and lifestyle. However, the data itself doesn’t produce these objectives, but rather it’s solutions that arise from analyzing it and finding the answers we need.\nTwo terms that have been discussed in relation to this future: big data and IoT. It’s hard to talk about one without the other, and although they are not the same thing, the two practices are closely intertwined.\nAs it relates to data, this disruptive technology requires new infrastructures, including hardware and software applications, as well as an operating system; enterprises will need to deal with the influx of data that starts flowing in and analyze it in real-time as it grows by the minute.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot – The Dark Knight of IoT]\nThat’s where big data analytics tools become a central piece to the IoT revolution, as they are capable of handling masses of data transmitted from IoT devices that produce a continuous stream of information.\nBut just to differentiate the two, the IoT delivers the information from which big data analytics can draw the information to create the insights required of it.\nHowever, the IoT brings data on a different scale, so the analytics solution should accommodate its needs of rapid ingestion and processing followed by an accurate and fast extraction. In the future, IoT companies will deliver real-time analytics on massive sized datasets, and essentially condense a full-rack database into a small server processing up to 100TB, so minimal hardware is required.\nThe next generation analytics database leverages GPU technology, allowing an even further downsizing of the hardware, i.e. big database in the car, or 5 TB on a laptop. This helps IoT companies correlate the growing number of data sets, which helps them get real-time responses and adapt to changing trends, solving the size challenge without compromising on the performance.\nThe next generation data base administrator, data scientist and data analyzers will all be advantaged keeping their finger on the pulse of these technological upheavals!\nSecurity\nRecognizing the massive problem of IoT, in early January 2017, the FTC launched a competition for security solutions to help solve the problem with a $25,000 reward. The five competition judges will grade submissions on how well the submitted IoT device’s security tools work and how user-friendly and scalable they are. The tool should focus on vulnerabilities in IoT device software specifically caused by out-of-date software or firmware, though additional features — such as default password settings — are acceptable, as well. The competition focuses the development of a tool to help with IoT device security, rather than policy or legislation.\nWhile the FTC’s effort and the efforts of many others to tackle security issues regarding IoT devices is laudable, it isn’t enough to ensure that we can leverage the full power of this new technology in a secure environment.\nSome of the biggest categorical security issues are the following:\n– Configuration and IoT Operational Security: There also must be a sound plan for installing security updates on IoT devices. Each consumer will likely soon own scores — if not hundreds — of connected devices. The idea of manually installing updates on so many devices is definitely out of the question, but having them automatically pushed by manufacturers also can be a risky business. Proper safeguards must be put in place to prevent updating interfaces from becoming security holes themselves.\n– IoT Gateways: Many IoT devices access the internet via consolidated software ‘gateways’ which act as controllers for their respective IoT networks. These gateways that connect IoT devices to company and manufacturer networks need to be secured as well as the devices themselves. IoT devices are always connected and always on. In contrast to human-controlled devices, they go through a one-time authentication process, which can make them perfect sources of infiltration into company networks. Therefore, more security needs to be implemented on these gateways to improve the overall security of the system.\n– Big Data / Data Security: We spoke above about the enormous potential for Big Data and Analytics with IoT, but there is an equally big problem created from this effort and that’s Data Security. More effort needs to be made to secure IoT-related data to ensure the privacy of consumers and the functionality of businesses and corporations. In addition, much more can be done to secure the growing repositories where IoT data is being stored, which can become attractive targets for corporate hackers and industrial spies who rely on big data to make profits. In the wake of massive data breaches and data theft cases we’ve seen in recent years, more effort needs to be made to secure IoT-related data to ensure the privacy of consumers and the functionality of businesses and corporations.\nWhat is evident is that the IoT will become an important part of our lives very soon, and its security is one of the major issues that must be addressed via active participation by the entire global tech community. Will we be able to harness this most-hyped, emerging technology that will undoubtedly revolutionize the world, or will we end up opening a Pandora’s Box that will spiral the world into a new age of mayhem and chaos? Let’s hope for the former.\nHopefully this helps give you a snapshot of the key technologies from which the IoT industry will be built and employ talent!\nBest of luck!\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'information technology\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'IT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/how-are-iot-skills-different-than-it-skills/');

Before Hajime was able to make headlines, Mirai was attributed to the attacks that took down Dyn on Oct 21st and lead to a large array of Fortune 500 companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, CNN, and Spotify being unreachable most of that day. Hajime evaded the attention but kept growing steadily and breeding in silence.\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, Hajime was not a headline, but rather a subject many researchers were studying and analyzing, trying to uncover the mystery behind its purpose and the intentions of its author. One week ago, Waylon Grange from Symantec published more quantitative research which assesses the size of the beast.\n(message written every 10 min on the terminal by Hajime)\nAfter the report from Sam and Ioannis, which found a vulnerability in the encryption code of the command and control channels, the author of the malware updated his botnet with a newer, improved version that is not vulnerable anymore and adopted the name âHajimeâ.\nNo attacks have been attributed to Hajime and it doesnât carry a payload to do so. But it is sophisticated, well designed and flexible enough to be repurposed in the blink of an eye. In my personal opinion, there are enough elements to believe there is a real and present danger in Hajime.\nHajime has been gaining considerable IoT market share for the last six months. Infection attempts by Hajime account for nearly 50% of the IoT bot activity in our honeypots. In a timespan of a little over five weeks, we counted almost 15,000 infection attempts from more than 12,000 unique IPs. We discovered that upon infecting, the Hajime bot sometimes leverages other infected nodes to download its malware, which increased our coverage and brought the current total number of unique infected IPs we could identify to almost 19,000.\n\nThe above graph shows the geographic spread of the botnet. Every dot accounts for a unique IP we were able to identify as an infected device.\nIn terms of infected countries, Vietnam is leading with Brazil, Iran, and Turkey following closely â but it being a global threat, most countries with well-established internet take a fair share of the infection pie.\n\n [You might also like: BrickerBot.3: The Janit0r is back, with a vengeance]\nHAJIME, THE NEXT GENERATION IOT BOT\nHajime is a sophisticated, flexible, thoughtfully designed and future-proof IoT botnet. It is capable of updating itself and provides the ability to extend its member bots with âricherâ functionality efficiently and fast. The distributed bot network used for command and control and updating is overlayed as a trackerless torrent on top of the well-known public BitTorrent peer-to-peer network using dynamic info_hashes that change on a daily basis. All communications through BitTorrent are signed and encrypted using RC4 and private/public keys.\nThe current extension module provides scan and loader services to discover and infect new victims. The efficient SYN scanner implementation scans for new victims through open ports TCP/23 (telnet) and TCP/5358 (WSDAPI). Upon discovering open Telnet ports, the extension module tries to exploit the victim using brute force shell login much the same way Mirai did. For this purpose, Hajime uses a list consisting of the 61 factory default passwords from Mirai and adds two new entries âroot/5upâ and âAdmin/5up,â which are factory defaults for Atheros wireless routers and access points. In addition, Hajime is capable of exploiting ARRIS modems using the password-of-the-day âbackdoorâ with the default seed as outlined here.\nHajime does not rashly follow a fixed sequence of credentials, from our honeypot logs we could conclude that the credentials used during an exploit change depending on the login banner of the victim. In doing so, Hajime increases its chances of successfully exploiting the device within a limited set of attempts and avoid the system account being locked or its IP being blacklisted for a set amount of time.\nUpon execution, Hajime prevents further access to the device through filtering ports known to be abused by IoT bots such as Mirai:\nâ¢ TCP/23 (telnet) â the primary exploit vector of Mirai and most IoT botnets\nâ¢ TCP/7547 (TR-069) â as first used in the DT attack by a Mirai variant\nâ¢ TCP/5555 (TR-069) â alternate port commonly used in TR-069\nâ¢ TCP/5358 (WSDAPI) â see separate section at the end about WSDAPI\nAt the same time, Hajime also tries to remove existing firewall rules with the name âCWMP_CRâ. CWMP refers to the CPE WAN Management Protocol or TR-069. Removing any potential CWMP rules set by an ISP to allow specific management IPs or subnets that will now be locked out leaving ISPs without control of the CPE device.\nBesides locking down the device, Hajime opens up port UDP/1457 and a random higher port number (> 1024) for UDP and TCP, and in doing so, allowing itself to use BitTorrent DHT and uTP from port UDP/1457 to build its peer-to-peer command and control network. The random higher port serves the purpose of the loader service used by the infection process to remotely download the malware onto new victims.\nThe extension module also has traces of a UPnP-IGD implementation which allows Hajime to create dynamic port forwarding rules in UPnP enabled gateways, allowing it to operate effectively from inside a protected home network. Even when all incoming traffic is blocked by a default ISP managed ruleset on the gateway, UPnP-IGD allows to punch pin-holes and expose internal services to the public internet.\n [You might also like: BrickerBot â The Dark Knight of IoT]\nHajime has binaries for the arm5, arm6, arm7, mipseb and mipsel platforms. User Psychotropos maintains a log of updated binaries and file hashes on his Github repository. Since January 28th the main binary has been updated six times, with the last update discovered on March 5th 2017. The extension module has been updated four times between January 18th and February 26th. Since the discovery of Hajime back in October 2016, the extension module changed names from âexpâ to âatkâ. The main binary name remained â.iâ and the downloader stub used during some infections is still called â.sâ.\nHajime prefers the use of volatile file systems as a working directory, ensuring any indicator of compromise is gone after a device reboot. Hajime is not persistent, meaning that rebooting the device will clean it from infection, but only until the next infectionâ¦\nPURPOSES\nThere has been lots of speculation about the greyness of the author and the intent and purpose of Hajime. If we set aside the speculation and the motivation of the original author, but focus on the potential purpose of such large IoT botnets, consider for a moment that this botnet could be hijacked from its original owner. Sam and Ioannis from Rapidity Networks uncovered a vulnerability in the encryption implementation of the initial Hajime malware and were able to reverse the messaging protocol. The vulnerability has been patched and updated, but a botnet this size with a flexible backend and high potential for criminal behavior will certainly attract the attention of black hatsâ¦ Whoever has the âkeysâ of the botnet will decide its fate!\nBecause of its flexible and extensible nature, Hajime can easily be repurposed and leveraged to perform tasks such as the following:\nâ¢ DDoS attacks\nâ¢ Massively distributed vulnerability scanning, allowing hackers to detect vulnerable, public exposed services and exploit them within hours after the disclosure of a new vulnerability (most systems are not patched within a few hoursâ¦ as history taught us). Custom exploit modules can be written in any language, as long as they compile to a binary for one of the supported platforms, and distributed through the torrent overlay to be executed by 10,000, maybe even 100,000 distributed nodes across the internet.\nâ¢ Massive surveillance network â the extension module could tap into RTSP streams from cameras.\nâ¢ IoT Bricker network â leveraging the work of BrickerBot, it would be a small and easy change to the atk program to perform a self-destructive sequence upon receiving a âplan Bâ command through the C2 channel. For example, a hacker could target and put a specific region or city in the dark by bricking all the infected devices corresponding to that region or city based on geography.\nFor now, however, Hajime is still under control of its original author (or so I hope) and mostly we are considering his intentions to be good. Still, I wonder why this white knight keeps growing his botnet and keeps the devices hostage â searching and scanning aggressively for the next potential victim. If his intentions are good, why not just leave the CWMP rules and improve on them? If the ISP did not apply adequate security, why not make the iptables rules persistent, or keep them volatile but release the device, and donât keep it indefinitely hostage until it is rebooted?\nCLOSING NOTE\nI hope our report and blog have given you a better view on what Hajime represents. If Hajime is a glimpse into what the future of IoT botnets looks like, I certainly hope the IoT industry gets its act together and starts seriously considering securing existing and new products. If not, our connected hopes and futures might depend on Rob the Janit0r and grey hat vigilantes to purge the threat the hard way…\nFor more statistics and a more technical analysis on Hajime, please read our ERT alert here: Hajime â Friend or Foe?\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Brickerbot\', \'Hajime\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/hajime-futureproof-botnet/');

OpIsrael is launched by Anonymous with the stated goal of “erasing Israel from the internet” in protest against the Israeli governments’ conduct in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. This is a yearly operation and was created in 2012. It starts every year on April 7th and ends on April 20th. This operation sees participants from Anonymous, AnonGhost, Red Cult, Anonymous Lebanon, Mauritania Attackers, Cyber Team Tox, M0oDyPL, MCA DDoS Team and LaResistance Hacking Team along with other independent attackers.\n\nIn the past years, Israel has seen moderate attacks launched against its networks and infrastructure. The most common tactics are website defacements and denial-of-service attacks but have also included application attacks and data dumps. Each year, hackers organize in public channels like Internet Relay Chats (IRCs), Telegram, Twitter and Facebook to discuss operational details. Attackers provide others with tools and technical guidance leading up to the operation. They will post links to videos, attack tools and recommend VPN’s along with target lists and content for social media.\nOpIsrael receives a large amount of attention for several reasons; one of them being the global media coverage surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The other is due to past operational successes by Anonymous, but in recent years this has been slowly fading. OpIsrael is losing its reputation as a successful operation overall. In recent years, pro-Israeli hackers have launched counter attacks against OpIsrael. These attacks are often more successful and gain more attention than the operation itself.\nThis year OpIsrael was very mild. The main activity only took place on the 7th with limited attacks for the rest of the campaign. There was very limited participation this year in most IRCs. Most users in the #OpIsrael IRC on AnonOps were just idling, and were likely researchers from other companies monitoring the events as well. This channel was eventually overrun by pro-Israeli hackers and eventually abandoned as the operation fell apart.\n#OpIsrael on AnonOps\nInside other IRC channels there was very limited support or guidance for those looking to participate. Most of the activity on social networks was concentrated on Facebook. Normally Anonymous operates around IRC channels and Twitter, but has been favoring Telegram and Facebook lately.\nAnonGhost for the last few years has used Telegram over IRC’s as their main channel of communication. This year their channel #OpIsrahell was the main channel by AnonGhost but was ultimately shut down after noticing details about their tactics and procedures were published by Radware.\nAnonOps IRC / #OpIsrael\nDefacements are the most common attacks seen during the operation. A defacement is when an attacker changes the visual appearance of a website by breaking into the webserver and replacing a page. This is a low level of vandalism often used to spread propaganda related to the operation. During OpIsrael dozens of small websites that are poorly maintained are temporarily vandalized with this form of electronic graffiti. Websites typically stay defaced for a few hours or until the admin realizes what happened. Website hxxp://fitwelpharma.com was targeted several times. It was originally used to host infected tools targeting OpIsrael attacks but was later defaced by Ghost Israel Cyber Army.\n\nThis year OpIsrael saw a limited number of DDoS attacks. Successful attacks only last a few moments as most attackers did not have enough power to keep a website offline. To add to this problem, many claims of success were false where no outage occurred. Several tools were shared leading up to April 7th, but most of these tools are outdated and easy to mitigate due to existing signatures. The Anonymous care package that was being shared inside the operation this year was a repost from 2012. Some GUI based tools shared publicly included Windows DoS, LOIC, HOIC, Tsunami, DAYA, Abdal ICMP, EbraSha DoS and An0nStr3ss.\n\nMajHoul, aka CyberRog of Redcult, was directing potential attackers to three different tools. CyberRog was spreading three different denial-of-service tools specifically designed to be used on mobile devices. These tools where Redcult Doser, LOIC RedCult edition and RC Doors. RC Doors is a clone of the app Packet Generator in the Google Play store.

Eng_Hassaniashe was spreading two tools, DDoS_Ano.exe and ddos_android.apk. Both tools contained malware most likely designed to target OpIsrael attackers. DDoS_Ano.exe contained DarkKomet while ddos_android.apk contained an Android backdoor spy tool. The first site used to host these tools was fitwelpharma.com which was compromised and later defaced.

Last year HaxStroke from AnonGhost posted a series of modified Python attack scripts. This year a few attackers were seen posting links to the attack scripts BlackHorizon, Saphyra and Crescent Moon by HaxStroke.  Last year SadAttack, an attack script nearly identical to the tool HTTP Unbearable Load King, also known as HULK was widely used by attackers. This year attackers also recommended the use of TorsHammer, a slow-rate HTTP POST (Layer 7) DoS tool that can be carried out through the Tor network.\nAttacker using BlackHorizon\n [You might also like: Don’t Fall Into the Ring of Fire]\nThe group MCA DDoS Team during OpIsrael claimed to have taken down Justice.gov.il but I was not able to verify their claim in real time. Moments after the tweet, MCA claimed they attacked the site but did not have enough power to keep them offline. Attacks like this are very common during this operation. Normally sites are back online before the attacker can publicly claim credit for the attack.\nMCA DDoS Team fail to keep site offline\nSQL attacks are rarely witnessed during OpIsrael. Most content leaked, such as data, during the operation is reposted material from past operations. During successful operations, attackers will use this technique to take advantage of poor application security. When application inputs are not sanitized it creates a possible vulnerability for an attacker. Attackers can modify an application’s SQL query to gain access and view unauthorized data, run remote commands on the server or drop and create objects in the database. These attacks are often launched ahead of the operations start date. The data is released during the operation to gain further attention and cause more fear.\n\nOpIsrael is full of opportunists looking to gain internet fame, eFame, based on previous hacks. These tricksters often fool the media by reposting what appears to be legitimate data. This year Anonymous Lebanon claimed to have dumped thousands of emails but upon further inspection, the two pastes are actually just a repost of a leak by Dark-Man team in May, 2013.\n\nDuring OpIsrael this year, attacker Giant’s-ps posted a paste containing the IP addresses and credentials for over 1,000 Internet of Things (IoT) devices in Israel. These devices appear to have been brute forced with a simple password list. All of the devices listed suffer from weak credentials. Some common usernames and passwords used are support:support, Admin:Admin, guest:guest and user:user.\n\nOther tools recommend during Anonymous operations usually include a variety of VPNs and anonymization software. This year attackers recommended the use of SaferVPN and Tor. These tools are designed to provide privacy but also to mask the origin location of the attacker. Lower level attackers will opt for free VPN services or Tor to mask their identity.\nThe Darknet has many uses. Sometimes attackers will use IRC’s on the Tor network or use services like Zerobin to post recent leaks and operational details. During OpIsrael 2017, the IRC channel #LaResistance on the Darknet, anonops532vcpz6z.onion:443, contained a series of dumps if you used the command !dumps. The command presented the users with several pastes found on the Darknet.\nanonops532vcpz6z.onion:443 / #LaResistance\n [You might also like: “For Educational Purposes Only”]\nDump from IRC channel #LaResistance\nThis year’s content produced by OpIsrael was particularly shameful for the operators. The content that was distrusted was identical to the content from 2012, with many alleged accounts participating in OpIsrael 2017 inactive or no longer existing. Additionally, some claims of successful attacks were false. Attackers posted links to new pastes containing alleged leaked information from successful hacks. Upon verification, it was determined that attackers were reposting leaks from a 2013 operation. \nThe tools and techniques publicly being used by Anonymous are outdated. Most of their denial-of-service attacks are conducted with old Graphical User Interface, GUI, tools for Windows and script tools mainly coded in Python, Perl or C. The attacks are often very weak and easily blocked by signatures already created for the tools. \nThe deeper issue with Anonymous seems to be their inability to evolve with the changing times. At one point, a few dozen kids with the Anonymous tool set was something to be concerned about. Today is a totally different landscape that includes 1Tbps attacks and massive IoT botnets. Even just a single hacker with a few compromised servers and a list of open resolvers can pack a punch.  The old attackers from inside the collective have moved on and no one is teaching anyone anymore. \nAttackers that are still launching DDoS attacks under the name Anonymous do so quietly and by themselves. They no longer need to control and orchestrate an attack from IRC. And still, with lone wolves out there with their IoT botnets, we still don’t see the network-crippling attacks promised by OpIsrael every year. \nNext year will be a make-or-break moment for the operation. If Anonymous fails to follow through again, their threats will likely not be taken seriously in the future. Defacing small, low traffic websites, falsely claiming DDoS attacks and reposting leaked data from previous years has damaged the collective reputation for OpIsrael. \nTo read the full threat alert, click here. \n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anonymous\', \'cybersecurity\', \'OpIsrael\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/opisrael-2017/');

Over a four-day period, our honeypots recorded 1,895 PDoS attempts performed from several locations around the world. Its sole purpose was to compromise IoT devices and corrupt their storage. Besides this intense, short-lived bot (BrickerBot.1), our honeypots recorded attempts from a second, very similar bot (BrickerBot.2) which started PDoS attempts on the same date – both bots were discovered less than one hour apart –with lower intensity but more thorough and its location(s) concealed by TOR egress nodes.\n\n\nYesterday we discovered a new version of the BrickerBot PDoS attack (BrickerBot.3) with a new command sequence on a different honeypot location. 1 hour after finalizing the report on the first 12h of BrickerBot.3 the article on the potential author of BrickerBot and the comments by this author were published by Catalin Cimpany on his blog.\nThe new PDoS attempt sequence, for which we named the bots that are responsible for performing the attacks BrickerBot.3, is the following:\n\nFor reference, the BrickerBot.1 command sequence:\n\nCompared with the original BrickerBot.1, the sequence of commands is very similar. It does not start with fdisk – but goes straight to business. The first six block devices it tries to corrupt (up to and including /dev/ram0) correspond with the BrickerBot.1 attack. The devices mtd0,1 and mtdblock1,2,3 are new for the Busybox version of BrickerBot. The fdisk commands to try to change the geometry of the block devices are identical to what BrickerBot.1 attempted. The end sequence again tries to disrupt connectivity by removing the default route and disabling TCP timestamps, wiping the root and limiting the number of kernel threats to one. The fork bomb, which was signature for BrickerBot.2 is not present.\nThe first 12 hours\nDuring the first 12 hours of the attack, a total of 1,118 PDoS attempts were recorded. The attacks all originated from a limited number of clear net IP addresses. ZoomEye and Shodan searches based on the source IPs of the attacks revealed all of them running an outdated version of the Dropbear SSH server (SSH-2.0-dropbear_0.51, SSH-2.0-dropbear_2013.58, and SSH-2.0-dropbear_2014.63).\n [You might also like: The Expansion of IoT since Mirai.]\nThe attacks started at 12:00 GMT on April 21st and in its first 12 hours, the number of bots performing the attacks grew up to 15 – the bot growth timeline is depicted in the graph below:\n\nThe devices used to perform the PDoS attacks on our honeypot do not correspond to the devices from BrickerBot.1. Although BrickerBot.1 was also abusing a limited number of clear net connected devices to perform its attack, there is no immediate correlation between both. For complete disclosure and transparency, the attacks were detected by a different honeypot than the one that detected the BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2 attacks.\nThe devices that perform the attack are spread around the globe and do not concentrate in a specific region and do not correlate to the locations of the BrickerBot.1 sources.\nHere is the geographic distribution of devices used by BrickerBot.2 to perform the attacks:\n\nExploit vector like Mirai\nIn line with BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2, this bot is also using the Mirai exploit vector to compromise the target. Any ‘Busybox’-based Linux device that has telnet exposed publically and has factory default credentials unchanged are a potential victim.\nBrickerBot.4\nBetween 5:22pm and 8:44pm GMT the same honeypot also detected yet another, very similar sequence of commands. The attack was only attempted from a single device which was located on the clear net and upon investigation also had an outdated version of the Dropbear SSH server (SSH-2.0-dropbear_2014.63). This isolated bot performed 90 attacks and was not seen again between 8:44pm and midnight.\nThe BrickerBot.4 command sequence has a few less block devices it tries to corrupt, as compared to BrickerBot.3:\n\n [You might also like: 5 Recommendations for IoT Manufacturers]\nRob the Janit0r\nA few hours after finalizing this report, Catalin Cimpanu published his article on the author of BrickerBot. A person who went by the name of “Janit0r” on Hackerforums alluded to being the author of BrickerBot on April 14th.\n\nThe Janit0r reached out to Victor Gevers based on a comment Victor made in one of the first articles on BrickerBot.1 and .2. The person confirmed he is the Janit0r on Hackforums and he is the author of BrickerBot.\nThe Janit0r:\nLike so many others I was dismayed by the indiscriminate DDoS attacks by IoT botnets in 2016. I thought for sure that the large attacks would force the industry to finally get its act together, but after a few months of record-breaking attacks it became obvious that in spite of all the sincere efforts the problem couldn’t be solved quickly enough by conventional means.\nBased on the Janit0r’s discussion, BrickerBot is more complex and most probably much larger than we initially believed it to be.\nThe Janit0r:\nI consider my project a form of “Internet Chemotherapy” I sometimes jokingly think of myself as The Doctor. Chemotherapy is a harsh treatment that nobody in their right mind would administer to a healthy patient, but the Internet was becoming seriously ill in Q3 and Q4/2016 and the moderate remedies were ineffective.\nFor the time being, it does not seem like the Janit0r will stop BrickerBot attacks, or at least not until officials and hardware vendors take definitive action to improve the state of IoT security.\nThe Potential Damage\nBrickerBot.3 and BrickerBot.4, like BrickerBot.1, are targeting ‘Busybox’-based Linux devices, typically IoT devices such as IP camera’s and DVRs. As mentioned in our BrickerBot blog from April 13th, we put the BrickerBot.1 command sequence to the test and assessed its impact on a real life device. The device in question was a Sricam AP003 Metal Gun Type Waterproof Outdoor Bullet IP camera, which is known to be ‘supported’ by Mirai. Although the know invokes thoughts of robustness, upon running the sequence of commands from BrickerBot.1, the camera got disconnected from the network and upon reboot was not responding anymore. Factory reset though a special button on the camera did not recover the IoT device. It was effectively bricked!\nProtecting your IoT Devices\nIt is not possible to assess how widely spread the attacks are, but the potential damage BrickerBot.3 can cause poses a clear and present danger for any IoT device with factory default credentials. As the attacks are still ongoing, we urge you to\n\nChange the device’s factory default credentials.\nDisable Telnet access to the device.\nUse Network Behavioral Analysis to detect anomalies in traffic and combine this with automatic signature generation for fast and effective mitigation.\nUse User/Entity behavioral analysis (UEBA) to spot granular anomalies in traffic early.\nGateway devices allow blocking Telnet default credentials. Use a DPI signature to detect default credentials and/or provided command sequences.\n\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Brickerbot\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-3-janit0r-back-with-vengeance/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (142, 'Why There Is No API Security', 'David Monahan', '2017-4-19', 'Whether we see them or not, application programming interfaces (APIs) are a crucial part of business today. They are used in virtually every aspect of IT and DevOps. APIs facilitate and even drive B2B and B2C partnerships, ecommerce acceleration, systems and application automation, and solution integrations. Without them, business and IT shops would not be able to deliver services anywhere near as fast and efficiently as they do today. However, this speed comes at a cost. User security is often a trade-off between security and usability and there seems to be a similar trade-off with leveraging APIs.\n\nBusinesses are pushing their application APIs harder to be more robust, flexible (a.k.a. open), and faster. API programmers often have to stretch the limits of operation to accept a wide variety of inputs. Even if a specification is produced to tell other programmers how the interface should be used, it is impossible to ensure that those same programmers will not misuse or otherwise find loopholes in the specification—but it is assured that threat actors will do just that. Though we have recourse with legitimate programmers, we do not have the same luxury with threat actors trying to do the same for malicious or otherwise nefarious purposes. This creates a problem for everyone using APIs to support business because they are simultaneously creating attack vector on their accessible API-enabled applications. While programmers can perform input validation, character filtering, and other checks on inputs to ensure they meet certain security requirements, security organizations will need to identify enhanced protection external to the application that has application-level intelligence for the inputs.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that insecurity with APIs has become pervasive enough that the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) added two areas of insecurity to their 2017 proposed list for Top 10 application vulnerabilities. Coming in at designation A7 is “Insufficient Attack Protection,” followed at designator A10 by “Underprotected APIs.” These are not a badge of honor. In fact, their rise to fame is a tragedy. As if we didn’t have enough to worry about, we created two new areas of concern with a failure to self-regulate the way we create and manage APIs. For More information on the new OWASP Top 10 click here to download the document.\n [You might also like: Why ISP DDoS Services Typically Fail]\nTo understand why APIs inherently lack security, you must understand that API exploits attempt to compromise the application in one of two ways. The first is through application programming errors that attempt to reveal data or impair the operation of the application. These exploits manifest themselves through malicious inputs like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other such attempts at exposing data. Generally, applications can be secured against programming errors. This is often an iterative approach that can take months to years of use, testing, patching and retesting, but it can be done.\nThe second avenue is through attempts to exploit the business logic of the application to create unauthorized access or fraudulent transactions. The harder portion to identify and stop are the exploits of business logic. Applications are being designed to deliver micro-services which expose a large number of interfaces to the Internet. This creates a larger attack surface with a net effect of providing threat actors the opportunity to attack each micro-service rather than a single application, creating a greater risk to the organization that attackers can get access to data. Because applications exploit various facets of operation rather than programming flaws, they require a greater understanding of operation than programming checks. No single part of the application, nor any part of normal Internet filtering firewall defense, has enough visibility into the context to stop business exploits. Some examples of business logic exploits are:\n\nModification of authentication flags and privilege escalations\nBusiness constraint exploitation/modification or business logic bypass to generate fraudulent transactions\nRequested parameter modification\nDeveloper’s cookie tampering and business process/logic bypass\nExploiting clients’ side business routines embedded in JavaScript, Flash, or Silverlight\nIdentity or profile extraction\nLDAP parameter identification and critical infrastructure access\n\nBusiness logic attacks are not trivial in their consequences and are successful on even the largest organizations. A few of the large organizations that fell victim to business logic flaws are Facebook, Nokia, and Vimeo.\nThere are multiple approaches to protect against business logic exposure from outside the application. Two of the most prominent are prevention and continuous monitoring. Prevention requires testing both initial development and throughout the API and application lifecycle. It is critical not to take shortcuts on this lifecycle process with so much riding on the success or failure of business-critical applications. Continuous monitoring can be done through vulnerability scanning to identify programming errors, but not to identify business logic errors. Protection from business logic errors requires technologies that are both API- and application-aware so when fraudulent, probative, erroneous, or otherwise bogus inputs arrive, they can be detected and filtered. This is a primary function of a Web Application Firewalls were designed to do.\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'APIs\', \'application programming interfaces\', \'cybersecurity\', \'OWASP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/no-api-security/');

And, as we learned from the recent Wikileaks dump, all those private messages youâre sending may not be so private.\nSo, if you had to choose, who would you rather have view what is on your phone? The government? Or your significant other?\n\nRadware commissioned a survey, conducted online by Harris Poll in March, which posed that question to more than 2,200 Americans ages 18 and older. If you said significant other, you fall in line with the majority â overall, 89 percent said theyâd rather have their spouse, girlfriend, or boyfriend see what they have on their phone than the government.\n\nWhether itâs a hacker dumping your emails or hacking your photos, or the government listening in, privacy is never guaranteed. Even though there are people we want to see our data and those we donât.\nThe big surprise? Certain generations are more amenable to government snooping than others.

We called the originator of the attacks âBrickerbot,â but should we have called it the âBatman of IoTâ?\n\n\nPermanent Denial of Service\nPDoS is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of its factory default software image. By exploiting security flaws or misconfigurations, this type of cyber-attack can destroy the firmware and/or basic functions of system usage. Recall the purpose of DDoS attacks, which overload their victim with requests up to the point they cannot perform their intended function anymore. When the attacks stop, however, the victim resumes its intended function as if nothing happened. PDoS, in contrast to DDoS, is more permanent. The attack is very short, but it leaves the device in such a state that it is not able to perform its intended function, even after the attack is terminated. After a PDoS, a device requires an on-site, manual intervention to recover it and restore its normal functioning.\nSome PDoS are more severe than others. Recall the USB stick that discharges 200 volts into the host computer and fries it. Or the demonstrations at EUSecWest back in June 2008 about how corrupted hardware could be delivered to flash a device and make it unusable, referred to as phlashing.\n [You might also like: IoT Threats: Whose problem is it?]\nBrickerBot\nThe PDoS attempts we discovered and discussed in our ERT Alert last week are performed remotely, through telnet access, and using commands that could ultimately corrupt storage, break connectivity and render the device unfunctional. The PDoS in question is targeting software rather than flashing or frying the hardware of its victims, which does however not make it less permanent, less damaging and less impacting. The discovered attacks were using the same exploit vector as Mirai, brute forcing their way in through Telnet. We coined it âBrickerBotâ because instead of enslaving IoT devices, like Mirai does, it attempts to destroy or âbrickâ them.\nBrickerBot.1: Over a four-day period, from March 20th through 25th, our honeypots recorded 1,895 PDoS attempts performed by a limited number of devices around the world. Tracing back the origin of the attacks, we discovered the use of outdated wireless access points and directive beam devices to perform the assault. There was no immediate indication of who might be the author of the attacks as there was no correlation between the location of the devices, besides them all running an older version of the Dropbear SSH server. After March 25th, 1.22am CET, the BrickerBot.1 attacks were gone and never showed up in our honeypots again.\nBrickerBot.2: Our honeypots recorded a series of very similar attempts that started within the same hour of BrickerBot.1, but were less intense. From March 20th till April 10th, a bot or a network of bots that operate from the Dark Web and are concealing itself behind TOR exit nodes were performing PDoS attempts nearly every 2 hours. Since April 10th, the frequency has dropped to about 1 attempt per day.\nWho is being targeted?\nThe use of the ‘Busybox’ command combined with the MTD and MMC special devices means this attack is targeted specifically at Linux/BusyBox-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The similar exploit vector as Mirai means the devices must have their Telnet port open and exposed publically on the Internet. Mostly this would match IoT devices that have been proven vulnerable to Mirai.\nBecause the process does not perform malware infection, but has a clear purpose of corrupting and disabling the device, there is no binary to study and there is not much we can say about how the bot finds its targets. Because BrickerBot.2 is hiding itself behind TOR exit nodes, there is no indication on the location of the bots or even how many bots might be out there. We could assume a random public IP scan to detect potential victims much like Mirai bots are performing. However, because there is no infection, the thread is not becoming larger and growing exponentially as with Mirai â so there must be a botnet harvested in a different way or a set of VPS owned by the author on the Dark Net that perform these attacks.\nThe Brick Test\nBeing convinced about the impact the commands would have on certain devices, there was still the question of how it would perform in the real world and how much a device like an IP cam would be left unrecoverable. Not the nicest task to volunteer for, but my good friend and colleague Ron stepped up in the name of science and volunteered his Sricam AP003 Metal Gun Type Waterproof Outdoor Bullet IP camera for the experiment. The camera is known to be supported by Mirai and represents the common class of devices that get enslaved by hackers for their large IoT botnets.\n [You might also like: The Expansion of IoT since Mirai.]\nUpon running the sequence of commands from BrickerBot.1, the camera got disconnected from the network and upon reboot was not responding anymore. Last hope was to perform a factory reset â there is a button for that purpose on the camera according to the manual. Unfortunately, even after performing the factory reset, the camera was not recovered and hence it was effectively bricked. Sorry Ron, thank you for giving up your IP cam! I owe you one (literally)!\nWhy?\nThis is the biggest mystery surrounding BrickerBot! Why would someone destroy IoT devices without benefiting from them? Unfortunately, right now there is no clear answer. When we discovered BrickerBot, at first we believed it was a drastic attempt to destroy existing and stop new IoT botnets, basically calling a halt to the growing IoT DDoS threat. But after some reflection it became clear that there might be benefiting conditions, such as hackers who are attempting to take out competition by targeting attacks to specific devices. Would this be a war of DDoS-for-hire suppliers fought on the Deep Web?\nUpon discovery of the second BrickerBot the theory slightly changed, as the second one is not using the typical âBusyboxâ command and which could indicate a hacker trying to target and compromise honeypots or sandboxes based on actual Linux images and performing and auditing or tracing commands. The question then rises how a list of potential honeypots could be obtained. Also, this would not affect purpose-built honeypots like ours, which is more of a chatterbot for IoT bots which does not actually execute commands.\nThen again, throughout the whole thought process I could not keep away from the idea that there might be a vigilante at work. Someone who had enough of the threats and attacks, who wants the security issues posed by IoT devices eradicated and to punish the owners and manufacturers in the process. Ethically speaking, we can only condemn this behavior, but I keep thinking of the words from Commissioner Jim Gordon in the movie âBatman: The Dark Knightâ:\nâBecause he’s the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we’ll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he’s not our hero. He’s a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight.â\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Brickerbot\', \'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/brickerbot-dark-knight-iot/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (145, 'Why ISP DDoS Services Typically Fail', 'David Monahan', '2017-4-12', 'Over the last couple of years, I wrote about DDoS attacks several times—with good reason. They are increasing in size and intensity. Each year more homes are connected to the Internet; consumers and businesses increase their access connection bandwidth; and more devices are online at each connection. With all these connected devices, many of which have little to no protection, the field is ripe for threat actors to harvest DDoS attack hosts, a.k.a. bots.\n\nThere are multiple strategies ranging in cost and efficacy for defending Internet properties and applications against DDoS attacks. With DDoS attack defense, you really get what you pay for. Aside from the roll-the-dice approach, which is doing nothing and hoping you don’t become a target, the next-lowest cost option organizations turn to is using their ISP as their first and primary line of defense.\n\nIt is important to understand that though using an ISP can be better than nothing, in the case of low-level attacks there may be limitations for medium- or large-scale volumetric attacks, application attacks, and identifying the back door attacks if the DDoS is used as a smoke screen.\nWhen choosing a DDoS protection solution, the first step is to determine how you are going to approach it: on-premises, cloud scrubbing or hybrid. If you are looking for a cloud-only solution, first determine the limitations on the providers’ bandwidth they can absorb and scrub both in their entirety and on a per client/incident basis. Next, ask the provider what their course of action is if that capacity is exceeded. Often in the case of a lower tier scrubbing center or a tier 2 ISP, once the attack exceeds the provider’s bandwidth rate or infrastructure capacity, the provider will “black hole” the traffic destined for your IP space. The term black-hole is just what it sounds like. Using one or more various network routing techniques, they block or route all traffic destined to you to nowhere, dropping it off the grid. They do this to maintain their other customers’ connections and thus those relationships. They cannot allow your issue to affect the other customers. The net result to you is the same as if you had no protection, because while traffic is black holed your web application is out of service. Lastly, ensure you know what the provider’s activation time is. Are they always on, or is the service automatically activated based on some predetermined condition, or does it need to be manually activated?\n [You might also like: The Cost of a DDoS Attack on the Darknet]\nWhen evaluating an on-premises solution, ISPs are generally limited to any OEM agreements they have in place for third-party solutions. For selection, you will need to investigate purchasing a solution from a channel partner, VAR, integrator, or directly from a vendor. Raw throughput to address volumetric DDoS is a consideration but not the primary one. For a volumetric attack, it’s a moot point to have the capacity of the appliance exceed the capacity of your Internet connection. It is more important to ensure the appliance can inspect and manage protocol and application-level attacks, which are becoming far more common. Since the ISP services function on OSI layers 3 (network) and 4 (transport), these more advanced techniques just appear as “traffic” to the ISP. So long as the volumes operate within acceptable parameters, the protocol and application attacks have a significant probability of sneaking by.\nEffective hybrid DDoS defense requires a significant partnership between on-premises equipment and the cloud scrubbing. Though this can be cobbled together with manual processes, that approach is highly inefficient and fraught with opportunities for failure. If you ISP has a preferred vendor with which it has integrations, carefully evaluate the performance of the solution. If not, you will need to look for a vendor that offers a hybrid DDoS protection solution. A native, rather than partnered solution usually works better, but test the claims. Ask for a reference customer.\nUltimately you need a solution with full OSI model spectrum of visibility; specifically, the layer 7 (application) intelligence to dissect and differentiate application communications to only remove the bad traffic. To gain surgical removal of undesirable traffic, you have to look for a DDoS mitigation partner with the scale to address the large attacks before they reach your valuable web properties and the finesse to detect application- and protocol-level attacks early so they can be addressed early in the attack while allowing the rest of the business traffic to reach its intended location. This requires a strong hybrid model using both on-premises appliances for early detection of application- and protocol-level attacks and an Internet service for capturing volumetric attacks.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Why ISP DDoS Services Typically Fail\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/why-isp-security-services-typically-fail/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"David Monahan\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/isp-ddos-protection.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1055,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-04-12\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-04-12\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'Internet Service Provider\', \'ISP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/why-isp-security-services-typically-fail/');

As much as we are eager to share and get responses to our personal moments on social media, we are even more eager to protect our private data. The privacy concern has become even stronger ever since we discovered as part of the Snowden revelations that the U.S. government (as well as others) is actually inspecting all internet communication.\n\nKeeping privacy poses a challenge for organizations, who try to balance their employeesâ privacy and corporate security. Privacy is very important. Protecting an organizationâs intellectual property is also important, and so is the need to detect malware and data leakages. In many cases, such balance is achieved by inspecting some of the encrypted communication of the organizationâs employees to the internet. The inspection is done automatically by security tools, which are designed to detect malwares without saving or checking the application content. Recently, this technique got a hit from US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team), advising that such inspection, also called HTTPS interception, is weakening security.\n\nIn this post, I would like to examine the benefits of HTTPS interception, as well as the risks it introduces. We will see that HTTPS interception gives a lot of power to the organization that deploys it, and quoting Spidermanâs uncle Ben â âwith great power comes great responsibility.â However, much like in the Marvel world, we would like the good guys to have this power, and bear the responsibility, for the common good.\nHTTPS interception allows the organization that uses it to look at the encrypted data sent in and out of the organization. Such inspection is very important â It allows the organization to detect and prevent malware infection and other security breaches. By inspecting the communication, the organization can detect Command and Control communications, and prevent malware from spreading and doing harm. Even if the malware is installed, the HTTPS interception can ensure that no important data is leaving the company to the wrong destination, which is also important in preventing espionage and other malicious acts. A complete eco-system of outbound data inspection was developed to prevent such problems. The ecosystem includes Data-Loss-Prevention devices, Firewalls, IPSes and more, all of which can be bypassed without the HTTPS interception.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nGiven all the above benefits, why would US-CERT advise against HTTPS interception? US-CERT does have a very good point. In order to explain it, I will first explain how HTTPS interception devices work. The HTTPS interception device is located at the edge of the organization, and it intercepts all HTTPS connections between the organizationâs network and the internet. Recent technology improvements, specifically, the usage of perfect-forward-secrecy encryption (PFS), do not allow interception devices to be out-of-band from the connection. The HTTPS interception device has to be a full proxy â in order to look at the communication it has to first terminate the connection from the internal user, and decrypt the data. the HTTPS interception device then sends the decrypted data to the outbound data-protection devices. After the data is verified to be legitimate, the HTTPS interception device re-encrypts the traffic and initiates another connection to the server in the internet. It then sends the encrypted data to the server.\n [You might also like: DNS Reflective Attacks]\nNow for the problem that US-CERT has raisedâ people want to protect their privacy, and attackers are constantly trying to get personal data from web surfers. The HTTPS protocol, relaying on SSL and TLS, is evolving quickly, making old encryption techniques vulnerable for cracking. For example â the move from SSL to TLS, and the current discussion on TLS 1.3 is a big part of these evolvements on the encryption side. On the authentication side we have Google Chrome, who recently stopped considering SHA1 certificates as secured, and other browsers are quickly following. Using a modern browser allows the user to be warned about using old or weak encryption or authentication, but the encryption and authentication that the browser can monitor and verify are a point-to-point privacy, and not an end-to-end privacy. The browser sees its secured connection to the next point. Usually this next point is the internet server, but if the organization is using an HTTPS interception device, this device terminates the connection, and opens another separate connection between itself and the internet server. Here lies the problem â the secured connection between the browser and the interception device is usually private and within the organization network. The risk, as US-CERT sees it, comes from bad security on the connection to the internet server â a connection the browser is not even part of, and has no way of checking or verifying.\nHowever, US-CERT discussion is ignoring a well-known fact in security. The most vulnerable part of the security ecosystem is the one sitting in front of the computer â the user. The user is prone to click ânextâ on any error message, especially if he/she does not really understand it. People are trained by life to ignore repeated warnings and giving the responsibility to the user is not always the best approach. Another concern exists when a malware hits the userâs computer. Such malware can steal private information, usernames and passwords, as well as the organizationâs IP. The organization has the right and even the obligation to stop this malware. If the malware is allowed to communicate securely, it will evade detection and cannot be stopped.\nIf the organization chooses to use a well-configured HTTPS interception device, it can reduce all these risks. A good device will simply refuse connecting to a poorly configured server (or maliciously configured ones). No ânextâ or âoverrideâ options for the user can actually ensure good security â not bad security. The organization should know what to inspect and what not to inspect (health data, banking, etc.) and a good device should give an option to bypass inspection on private data. A good HTTPS-interception device should also block fraudulent URLs and protect the user even further.\nLike any technology, the organization needs to know how to use it in order to make it work well. The technology by itself is not âgoodâ or âbadâ â the usage is what makes a difference. Using an up-to-date HTTPS interception device, with a strong security company behind it, and a good understanding of its configuration, allows the organization to provide security to both itself and to its individual employees. It allows the employees to share what they want to share, and keep their privacy on their intimate data, while protecting them from malwares and weak security. The HTTPS interception device can strengthen the security if configured correctly, or weaken it if configured incorrectly. Our concern should be on enhancing the knowledge of how to use the technology, and not on warning against it.\n\n\nRead “Creating a Safe Environment for Under-Protected APIs” to learn more. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'HTTPS\', \'HTTPS Interception\', \'privacy\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/04/https-interception-use-without-concern/');

Between EU and / or local regulations, the ambition to keep the organization secure by all means, and the business demands to be dynamic and agile, it is easy to spot the CISO in a board meeting – look for the person who looks the most frustrated.\nThere is a correlation between a growing number of unhappy CISOs and security events. A lot has been discussed concerning the evolution of cyber-attack tools into mature, powerful and sophisticated programs, and the growing resources companies have to invest in technology, labor, compliance and skill.\nWe at Radware went ahead to get a closer look at the concerns and experiences of European companies. As part of our Global Application and Network security report, we surveyed more than 150 security professionals – from companies of all natures – across Europe and I’m happy to share their lessons in this blog, hoping to provide useful insights to those unhappy CISOs.\nSource: Radware’s European Application and Network Security Report\nFigure 3: Obstacles when it comes to cyber-attacksSource: Radware’s European Application and Network Security Report\nYet, one thing that seems organizations are not capable of doing is moving with the right speed. They keep lagging behind due to many reasons, but the result is a growing chasm between the level of preparedness and the available tools in their possession. Some lack the right solutions, some simply lack the awareness and others lack the skill. Obviously, the majority (55%) express frustration with available budgets and headcount.\nPerils hovering above the continent\nApart from the economic unrest caused by Brexit, the Euro devaluation and other political debates, 2016 introduced a new level of threats that European businesses have suffered from. First, the cyber-ransom plague that hit every other organization in the continent. Second, more and more hackers and cyber-criminals are taking advantage of SSL traffic to launch cyber-attacks.\nThird, OVH – a French hosting company – was hit by allegedly the largest DDoS attack ever officially reported, suffering massive traffic bursts ranging between 100Gbps and a total of 1Tbps!\nOriginal tweet by OVH Owner, Octave Klaba, reporting the DDoS attack in real time\nThis attack demonstrated the power of IoT botnets and was followed by a failed takeover attempt on 900,000 routers belong to Deutsche Telekom 2 months later. Just imagine the amount of traffic 9000,000 enslaved devices can genereate. So Europe had a taste of IoT botnets, and now when their source code has become public, it should be prepared for more.\nFigure 4: stats representing experiences of European organizationsData source: Radware’s European Application and Network Security Report\nIs SSL Always Safe?\nAs the question implies, obviously not. Encrypted communication requires a lot more resources from the network components such as the Firewall, ADCs and the servers themselves, which in many cases are falling short when the load is growing. Considering SSL traffic over the internet has grown by 48% – and 35% of LAN / WAN traffic – companies must be able to match the requirement in order to continue to be able to securely serve their clients.\nSSL-based attacks are the fastest growing attack vector in Europe (see figure 4) – as validated by 29% considering it as their principal weakness in the case of an SSL-based DDoS attack (vs. 23% in 2015) – less than one in four companies (23%) confidently say they are able to mitigate one.\nInternet of Things (IoT) Botnets Open the 1Tbps Floodgates\nOn September 21st, 2016, a French hosting company was hit by allegedly 1.2Tbps DDoS attack. This record-breaking volume was generated by ~145,000 IoT devices that were all infected with the remotely-controlled Mirai botnet. Ten days later, Mirai turned out to be the first IoT open-source botnet, upon the release of its source code to the community. Mirai exemplifies why preparing for “common” attacks is no longer enough. Not only it is capable of generating masses of traffic, far beyond the capacity of most organizations around the globe, it also features sophisticated attack vectors such as GRE floods and DNS water torture attacks. Security strategies cannot remain the same when such a threat is lurking. Companies have to adjust their mitigation plans not only in preparation for a large volumetric attack, but also for the event of being attacked by a mutation or a customized version of Mirai. This is a “known unknown” that can only be detected by intelligent automation such as behavioral analysis or machine learning.\nWhile this may sound too similar to sci-fi to many businesses, the reality is that 76% of European organizations suffer low volumes (below 1Gbps) of DDoS attacks resulting in loss of productivity, poor customer experience and damage to the brand perception.\nCyber-Ransom Plague hits every second European enterprise\nFinancial/ransom motives behind cyber-attacks. Source: Radware’s European Application and Network Security Report\nUntil the IT press turned the spotlight on the IoT botnets, the #1 topic was a plague of ransom attacks hitting companies worldwide, but particularly prevalent in Europe. Most ransom attacks appeared in the form of hundreds of encrypting malware types – which became more and more sophisticated as defenses and patches followed – and in another form, as extortion letters followed by DDoS attacks. Unfortunately, this was a very rewarding attack method for perpetrators and other criminals, which are expected to take it to the next level in 2017, threatening critical systems and even public infrastructures. It was so successful that some copycat groups used this method of extortion, with no real attack capabilities at hand. They just counted on the stress to do the job. 49% of European organizations named ransomware as the #1 motivation behind cyber-attacks they suffered this year.\nPreparedness\nI find it both surprising and unfortunate that European organizations express the least level of preparedness compared to other territories. You can see the following scores that demonstrate where they fall short. Our findings should be an alarm call to EU businesses as they are probably struggling with ghosts in the form of a variety of issues they don’t have the visibility into, and doubtfully know about.\nPreparedness of European organizations compared to other geographies. Source: Radware’s European Application and Network Security Report\nService Availability is #1 Concern\nPartial or full service availability impact (34%), together with data leakage (23%), were the top two concerns for European organizations in 2016 – more than reputation loss or revenue loss.\n69% point at service outage / degradation as causing the most damage to their business.\n44% do not have ER plans\nAt the beginning of this post, we noted that European organizations tend to be targeted more. Add to that our global report’s finding that 98% of businesses suffered at least one attack a year – there are still a huge number of enterprises in Europe that do not have an emergency response plan for a cyber-security incident. Obviously, designing such a plan in advance will not only assist in quick elimination of the threat, but also reduce associated costs (see more in our global report).\n79% don’t calculate the real cost of cyber-attacks\n\nIf companies knew what the real cost of cyber-attacks is, perhaps 44% of them could say, “I don’t need an ER plan.” But this isn’t the case, as the vast majority of European organizations did not come up with a formula and therefore do not know the real cost. Moreover, they seem to provide the lowest estimation compared to other geographies. Our global report shows that companies who calculate such costs provide nearly as double the estimation – meaning security professionals in Europe better pay attention and reevaluate.\nTo learn more on European threat landscape trends and real life experiences please download the report here.\nTo read Radware’s Global network and application security report please click here.

It is important to deploy and leverage technologies that can adapt and change with our security models. In the technology world, when the networking and application protocols were initially developed, minimal thought was given to security. Protocols like Telnet, FTP, DNS, SMTP, and even HTTP were designed for function and user-experience, not integrity.\n\nNetwork architectures are changing with the evolution of software-defined technologies, cloud, and virtualization. Meanwhile, applications and the data they are delivering are morphing to be specific, individualized, and timely. Systems are not monolithic and proprietary mainframes based on centralized computing technologies. Applications are not major endeavors that require years of development and enormous resources to support.\n\nPart of the genetic makeup\nApplication delivery technologies that are available through application delivery controllers (ADC) were created to provide the availability, reliability, and scalability that users expect from their applications. The load balancing technologies enable the ADC to increase its usability by acting as a security gateway for the applications.\nAs a reverse proxy, the ADC has the insight to manage and protect the application and its content. The ADC protects the IP addresses of the application servers by hosting a unique IP address to virtualize the real servers. In the OSI networking model, this is layer 3 security. The ADC only allows specific TCP and UDP ports to be available for the user to access. For example, only port 53 for TCP and UDP are allowed for DNS servers. This is layer 4 security.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWhen one combines layer 3 and layer 4 security along with the source (user) and destination (application) information, this allows the ADC to protect the application through what is traditionally known as an access-control list (ACL). The ability to protect components in the IT infrastructure through ACLs is what a traditional firewall does. In other words, the ADC is a true network firewall because of its ability to load balance application servers.\n [You might also like: Network Security Does Not Matter When You Invite the Hacker Inside]\nThe right place, the right time\nThe ADC is designed to do content inspection to steer traffic to different application servers based on the content received. The ability to do this content inspection and then make a decision on what do to with the traffic, including dropping or blocking the traffic is what an advanced next generation firewall (NGFW) or intrusion prevention system (IPS) is designed to do.\nWhile the ADC has not evolved to become a fully functional IPS or NGFW yet, web application firewall (WAF) capabilities have been added to enhance the security capabilities for the dominant application transport on the internet, HTTP. Businesses are using the WAF built into ADCs to protect their applications and ensure compliance for security standards such as PCI and HIPAA.\nEvolving from the individual to the ecosystem\nThe next step in the evolution of ADC security capabilities is to integrate with the new network architectures. Management and orchestration across disparate technologies and components to create a fully integrated and interactive network ecosystem. There are other components and technologies that the ADC must integrate with such as the IPS and NGFW solutions mentioned before as well as other security functions like DDoS mitigation, and outbound content inspection technologies.\nADCs are a key piece of this environment. Technologists will continue to enhance the function of the ADC as a critical component within their dynamic, self-healing, and ultimately self-aware next generation networks.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/03/cannot-application-delivery-without-security/');

This introduces a number of security challenges:\n\nYou cannot protect if you cannot detect: The fact that your application is hosted in the cloud limits your ability to monitor its behavior and detect any abnormalities that can be potential attacks.Â  Now you may think that your application is protected because it’s on a public cloud but in fact, cloud-based applications, even those hosted on public clouds like AWS and Azure, get hit by DDoS attacks regularly. Lately, with the growth in Internet of Things (IoT)- enabled devices, attackers are launching massive application-layer DDoS attacks that can either bring down or create prohibitive costs for Web applications that are hosted on public clouds.\nYour protection is only as good as what your cloud provider gives you: Relying on your cloud provider for protection is the most intuitive thing to do but does it give you the best protection you need? Not necessarily. Public cloud providers offer only very limited protection, if at all, against DDoS attacks. Those that do offer DDoS protection typically only focus on network-layer DDoS protection, and lack protection from application and SSL-based DDoS attacks, leaving you exposed to attacks such as launched by the Mirai Botnet.\nProtection without borders: Say your application hosted on AWS is attacked. You are able to detect the attack and block it, so that specific application is now protected.Â  But what happens with your other applications? How can you now protect your applications that are hosted in your data center from the same attack? These questions simply cannot be answered if you are using different solutions to protect your premise- and cloud- based applications.\nHidden costs of attack traffic: If you can’t protect your applications when you are under attack, not only does your business suffer but you also need to pay your cloud provider for all that extra traffic that reaches your application. That adds up to a lot!\n\n [You might also like: 9 Ways to Ensure Cloud Security]\nBefore you give up, there is a solution for all of this. Â When thinking about DDoS protection for your applications, look for a unified “single pane-of-glass” solution that can protect your applications anywhere and everywhere.Â Â  Keep in mind you will likely need different protection types (hybrid, on-demand or always-on) depending on where your applications are hosted.\nFor your applications hosted on public clouds, such as AWS or Azure, most vendors will offer you an always-on DDoS protection service.Â  In this case the traffic going towards your application is routed first through the security vendor’s scrubbing center before it reaches your applications â always and all the time.Â  While this solution provides you with real-time detection and mitigation, it also comes at a cost of increased latency, even during peacetime, and increased cost of the service (always-on costs more!).\nInstead, choose an on-demand cloud DDoS protection service that does not add latency to your traffic in peacetime.Â  You should go for an on-demand service that still provides automatic detection of attacks and real-time mitigation â it does exist! In addition, you should choose a solution that offers the widest protection and does not limit to only network-layer attack protection.\nFinally, remember that itâs not a one-size-fits-all approach.

In fact, the threat has been discussed for many years by security researchers.  It has only now gained public attention due to the release and rampage of the Mirai botnet. Since Mirai broke the 1Tbps mark in late 2016 the IoT threat has become a popular topic of conversation for many industries that utilize connected devices. Not only are companies worried about if their devices are vulnerable but they are also worried if those devices can be used to launch a DDoS attack, one possibly aimed at their own network.\n\nThere have been two key outcomes since the publication of the Mirai’s source code. One is that it has given everyone the ability to easily build and customize their own IoT botnet. Second is that it has created demand for a security standard for IoT devices.  Most of these IoT devices are infected within minutes of being connected to the internet and most users do not know how to secure the devices themselves. \n\nSpreading the epidemic.\nDigital vending solutions and kiosks around the world are rapidly becoming more advanced. Some of these devices are connected to the internet with a mobile router so they can help improve accuracy and efficiency of the service by collecting and storing data. Companies using this new technology can connect to these devices to view sales reports, check inventory and monitor service issues. Unfortunately, in a rush to connect everything some of these devices used for remote monitoring have been found to have multiple vulnerabilities including weak credential management. This left these new smart solutions exposed online to attackers. \nBotnets like qBot, Hajime, Mirai and others target these smart solutions by using scanners designed to locate connected devices with exposed ports and default credentials.  Once infected these devices look to spread their malware and persistently target more and more devices every day. The IoT botnet scanners will look for vulnerable devices connected to the internet and attempt to gain access by brute forcing the login with a set of default passwords. Once it gains privileged access it will load the malicious source code appropriate to the architecture and enslave the device into the botnet. \n [You might also like: IoT Threats: Whose problem is it?]\nSince we started tracking the Mirai botnet we have monitored 2,790 attacks, most of which are basic UDP flood and DNS water torture attacks. When Mirai was released, the scanner included 61 default passwords. All a bot herder has to do is collect and add more default credentials from other manufacturers to a scanner and they will be able to enslave new devices into their botnet.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWhy is this happening?\nThe problem with IoT devices is that they are always on, 24/7, and can produce large scale attacks when infected.  Unlike a PC botnet, when an IoT bot herder wants to launch an attack, they will have most of the infected devices online and ready to go. The increase of available devices participating in an IoT attack, in combination with faster internet connections, can result in massive 1Tbps DDoS attacks. These devices are scanned, targeted and infected within minutes of being activated and connected, and are attacked hundreds of times a day by other IoT devices that have already been infected. \nIoT devices are sold vulnerable in the form of number of services and ports that are open by default. Users who don’t know to change default passwords immediately will hardly be able to know how to reconfigure the device and close specific ports. \nIoT devices are sold with very weak credentials. They are often root:root or admin:admin and are hardly ever changed by the end user when deployed. Once these devices become infected, the malware will change the default password to prevent the user from logging in and to prevent other attackers from taking over their infected bots. \nSince the publication of Mirai, a number of attackers have deployed their own IoT botnets and are actively scanning and looking for new victims. Even just a botnet with a few thousand infected IoT devices could cause major problems for businesses – from mere resource consumption to significant service degradation or even a complete outage. Even worse, DDoS-for-Ransom groups are now using IoT botnets like Mirai as intimidation in their ransom notes.\nRecommendations.\nThe IoT threat is a serious one but one that can be simply resolved.  While it’s almost impossible to educate everyone on how to change their user name and passwords on these devices, it is possible for manufacturers to incorporate security features into the design and production of these devices, in particular security telnet communication and its associated ports. Default passwords must be random and users should be advised with simple instructions on how to change them. \nWe also recommend home users take these four steps to better prepare:\n•	Stay current – Update firmware and software regularly\n•	Authentication –  Use unique credentials for each device\n•	Configuration – Close unnecessary ports and disable unnecessary services\n•	Segment – Create separate network zones for your IoT systems\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/expansion-iot-since-mirai/');

In general terms it stands for distribution of functions and responsibilities to less involved parties. For some people decentralization carries negative connotations and implies inefficiency and inaccurate performance of mechanisms. In most cases this standpoint may carry much conviction, but not in terms of bitcoin exchange and its underlying principles.\n\nAny bitcoin related activities are based on a blockchain technology, which follows the idea of a decentralized networking system with a priority given to utmost security and transparency of transactions. Bitcoin protocol is protected by advanced mathematical and cryptographic algorithms, so that it can hardly be manipulated by any third party without dedicated encryption keys and digital signatures. Not any transaction, taking place inside the network, will go unnoticed and unvalidated, because each circulating bitcoin is under rigorous surveillance of bitcoin miners and blockchain nodes. This sound approach to bitcoin processing definitely inspires confidence in the currency itself and bitcoin-related services as a whole.\nBut don’t jump the gun! In spite of the fact that Bitcoin is gaining pace and has established itself as the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin-related market is still at its immaturity.\n\nTwo sides of the Bitcoin\nBitcoin greatly resembles fiat currency in terms of buying and selling. There are virtual exchanges and service platforms, where bitcoins are traded and can be redeemed for traditional currency. But unlike traditional financial institutions, bitcoin exchanges are not controlled and maintained by any central authority in charge of monetary assets. Is it for good or for bad? Both scenarios are possible here.\nKeeping bitcoins within virtual exchanges offers a great deal of trading flexibility and freedom. When referring to bitcoin exchanges the user can be sure of a simple exchange process and full technological support at any stage of trading. Along with that, virtual exchanges keep a close watch on bitcoin price fluctuations and provide their users with the most up-to-date information on bitcoin market behaviour. This is a pretty smart technique for the user to have his finger on the pulse and get into big money by securing a good bargain at a well-chosen moment.\nRegardless of the fact that Bitcoin is a relatively new phenomenon and hasn’t yet demonstrated its tried-and-true security excellence, bitcoin protocol is still safe enough and has little chances to be compromised.\nHowever, the same cannot be said for bitcoin exchanges and related services, which are sometimes far from being as perfectly safe as they should be and become the major security weakness in Bitcoin environment.\n [You might also like: How To Buy Bitcoin]\nWorld’s largest but not safest\nDue to the fact that bitcoin exchanges host solid investments, they are hugely exposed to hacker attacks and external intrusion. Tech-savvy bitcoin hunters exploit leading-edge technology to find flaws and vulnerabilities in “ultra-secure” exchanges and sometimes hit the jackpot.\nMt. Gox: The Story With No Happy Ending\nTokyo-based bitcoin exchange began its operations in 2010 at the very dawn of Bitcoin era. Mt. Gox was growing its bitcoin trading business at a rapid pace and soon became the world’s largest bitcoin exchange.\n2014 became crucial for Mt. Gox and its users. Mt. Gox announced bitcoin trading suspension and froze all accounts due to security system vulnerabilities. As it came to be known afterwards, Mt. Gox became subject to continuous hacker attacks and lost over 850,000 bitcoins to the value of about 450 million dollars.\nIn a short while Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy and shut down their operations. According to the official line, bitcoins were stolen because of transaction malleability.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nBitfinex: In Pursuit of Good Credit\nBitfinex is one of the largest exchanges, having a pretty nice amount of bitcoins in circulation. It makes the top four virtual exchanges in terms of digital currency trading and enjoys great popularity among investors.\nIn August, 2016 Bitfinex came up with the news that hit its customers like a ton of bricks. Bitfinex reported a loss of 120,000 bitcoins, the value of which is about 70 million dollars. According to Bitfinex representatives, the thieves targeted only bitcoins and hacked into a limited number of wallets, whereas many other accounts were not compromised. To reimburse affected customers for their damage Bitfinex splitted losses among all users, reducing their deposits by 36%.\nBitfinex security breach is still under investigation and the details are kept confidential.\nSo far, lost amounts of bitcoins account for more than 500 million dollars, if taking into account only these two sensational bitcoin exchange robberies. And what if we dug a little deeper and sent other bitcoin theft incidents to the surface? The total amount of stolen funds would be shocking.\n [You might also like: The Current Surge of Bitcoin Prices]\nNo centralization – no compensation\nIn the context of Bitfinex hack, users appeared to be relatively unaffected, largely owing to refunding decisions made by Bitfinex executives. It should be stressed that such reimbursement practices are applied by bitcoin exchanges on very rare occasions. \nBy nature, Bitcoin market is decentralized and thus not regulated by any superior authority. You will be fortunate to stumble upon an exchange, paying much attention to customer fund care. \nMost bitcoin exchanges emerge from nowhere and vanish overnight, leaving their customers dead broke. It is almost impossible to identify, which exchange is reliable and trustworthy, because it is controlled only by its founders. Therefore, you should be a real venturer to keep all your funds within a virtual exchange or a billionaire, who can afford sacrificing a million or two.\nBetter safe than sorry\nGreed for gain has always been a driving force behind most criminal activities. Being major digital currency repositories, bitcoin exchanges will remain a hot target for cyber-attacks as long as they exist. \nYear by year hackers are becoming more creative and persistent, which results in massive cyber-attacks forwarded to bitcoin-related services. Cybercriminals stay strong in the pursuit of their goals and invent new methods to target digital wallets, infect systems and block traffic. Bitcoin exchanges are continuously suffering from heavy DDoS attacks (distributed denial of service), which cause trading activity disruption and system malfunctioning. \nBitcoin hacking attempts are inevitable and will be gaining pace, but they can still be restrained. Seeking great customer recognition and confidence, bitcoin exchanges are now taking strict security measures to keep user funds safe. \nAdvanced authentication. Two-factor or multifactor authentication methods add extra levels of security and make it extremely difficult for intruders to compromise your account. The user is required to enter his ID, password and a specially generated one-time code to confirm his identity. \nMultisignature. This method is used to protect bitcoin transactions by multiple keys, assigned to different nodes on the network. The transaction is considered valid, if authorized and verified by more than one signature. \nCold storage. Cold wallets allow users to hold their bitcoins offline. The best way to keep your funds safe is to store them on the medium, disconnected from the Internet and thus away from hacker’s reach.\nTo provide customers with the level of security, which is close to perfect, some bitcoin exchanges do employ all above-mentioned methods and take even more precautions to protect their systems. In addition to that, they ensure immediate withdrawals of customer funds and follow compensation policies. Hopefully, prospects of bitcoin exchanges seem to be not so gloomy and there is always a way out!\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'bitcoin exchange\', \'Cyber Security\', \'cyber threat\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/cyber-threat-grows-bitcoin-exchanges/');

After the attacks on Dyn shook the internet in October, many organizations will forever deploy redundant DNS services or providers. Further, people now use 1 Tbps as their high watermark for DDoS protections and more organizations are adopting hybrid DDoS protections.\n\n\nNot long after the Dyn attack, there was a congressional hearing on the state of Internet of Things (IoT) security and its threat to Internet. Among others, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have both recently published IoT security guidelines.  The FTC even sued manufacturer D-Link, claiming they had insufficient protections built into their devices.\nEarlier this year, I presented some technical research on the Mirai botnet at NANOG 69 in Washington DC, and I also joined a panel to discuss IoT security. Half of the panel members represented service providers and manufacturers, and the other half represented policy and regulation interests.  The consensus of the panel was that we clearly have a huge threat, but how to address the issue is even more difficult.\n\nFor example, in an open market, price will often drive product sales. If an average consumer is deciding on which IoT device to buy, as long as that device will meet their needs, many consumers will often buy the lowest cost device. A home printer is a perfect example of this. The buyers don’t think about the security aspects of it, or how to update it later on (if that’s even possible). Many times, the way a manufacturer can create the least expensive device is by relying on components from other manufacturers. That’s what happened in many cases with the Mirai attacks – exploited devices used components from third party manufacturers, so they didn’t even know about the vulnerabilities.\nI have listened to some very smart ideas on how to address the issue, from requiring manufacturers to obtain a certification for sale, to using a policy-based framework that controls what devices are allowed to do in a network, perhaps similar to 802.1x. Eventually there will be a solution, and I’d love to see manufacturers voluntarily adhere to whatever standard is adopted, but this fix won’t happen any time soon.\nSo until then, the problem persists: Whose responsibility is it to stop IoT attacks?\nIn some respects, we all have a role in it, but this also won’t fix the problem. Only a certain population of end users will know enough about the issue or care enough about it to stop the problem. So we can’t count on users to fix the problems.\nManufacturers do need to give careful thought to the issue and they do need to employ mechanisms that allow for upgrades, patches, and fixes. However, we really can’t expect to hold manufacturers accountable for these kinds of issues today if they have demonstrated reasonable efforts to secure their product, which itself would even be hard to govern. Attackers are innovative and they’re constantly looking for exploits of common technologies and protocols. Yes, leaving telnet running by default and having hard coded root-level credentials that can’t be changed is a horrible idea. But it’s also an extreme example and the issue won’t always be so black and white. Can you hold manufacturers whose devices participate in SNMP or NTP reflection attacks accountable too? Of course not.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nA government or standards-based certification for IoT devices isn’t practical in the near term. In fact, if there are costs associated with achieving these certifications, such regulations could hinder innovation and very likely be a barrier of entry for startup companies. This is appropriate in some cases like where personal health or safety can be at risk, but DVR systems and printers, for example, have no need for an enforced standards certification. In the end, I don’t think that the general public would care enough to buy something where this is the differentiator. These type of certifications would really just need to be adopted voluntarily by the manufacturers as a best practice.\n [You might also like: 5 Recommendations for IoT Manufacturers]\nI’m not saying that device manufacturers are off the hook. They absolutely have a responsibility to deliver a product that is safe, protects their customer’s privacy, and is a properly behaved network device. But if we know anything in cybersecurity, we know that exploits and vulnerabilities are often hiding just around the corner. It just isn’t reasonable to expect that every IoT manufacturer will always have a way to patch or update any device ever produced.\nSo who is left? Who should be accountable when devices participate in attacks on the internet?\nThe answer is the service provider of the customer who is participating in the attack. The organization that is being paid to provide access to the internet by an end user should absolutely have the responsibility of ensuring their customer isn’t participating in abusive activity. Not only are they profiting from connecting their customer to the internet, but they also have the knowledge of how to handle abusive activity and the ability to stop it – something that the average internet user never will. They have visibility into the user’s traffic, so they can see when users are misbehaving. Most residential users will never have this insight or knowledge of the topic.\nAs you can imagine, this idea isn’t popular in parts of the service provider space. There are costs to this kind of work (even to simply answer the phone) and those costs can erode revenue. But there’s also precedence. When spam originates from a customer’s network, the service providers address it with the customer – even if it takes a few abuse complaints before it happens. If someone is abusive, the security team usually handles it.\nMake no mistake, service providers do care about having responsible customers and as I’ve stated above, they do take action. But it’s time that ISPs give more thought to how to ensure their customers are not participating in these attacks. Spam and things like protocol reflection attacks are a little bit easier to fingerprint and block. Staying ahead of zero-day attacks and the traffic patterns that accompany them is a whole different challenge. Behavioral technologies are really the only way to take on this challenge. Otherwise, a service provider’s response can only be based on postmortem analysis or abuse complaints.\nMost of my career has been in the technical and operations side of the internet service provider space, so I certainly understand the business impact here. But I also know that service providers are best suited to address this problem. Maybe it’s adding behavioral technologies to existing CPE, or maybe it’s taking a different look at flow data and building processes around new anomalies that are detected. But no other entity will have the insight to customer traffic and the knowledge of how to contain abusive traffic as a user’s service provider. Now they just need the motivation.\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'cybersecurity\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/iot-threats-whose-problem/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (153, 'The Cost of a DDoS Attack on the Darknet', 'David Monahan', '2017-3-15', 'Distributed Denial of Service attacks, commonly called DDoS, have been around since the 1990s. Over the last few years they became increasingly commonplace and intense. Much of this change can be attributed to three factors:\n\n1. The evolution and commercialization of the dark web\n2. The explosion of connected (IoT) devices\n3. The spread of cryptocurrency\nThis blog discusses how each of these three factors affects the availability and economics of spawning a DDoS attack and why they mean that things are going to get worse before they get better.\n\nEvolution and Commercialization of the Dark Web\nThough dark web/deep web services are not served up in Google for the casual Internet surfer, they exist and are thriving. The dark web is no longer a place created by Internet Relay Chat or other text-only forums. It is a full-fledged part of the Internet where anyone can purchase any sort of illicit substance and services. There are vendor ratings such as those for “normal” vendors, like YELP. There are support forums and staff, customer satisfaction guarantees and surveys, and service catalogues. It is a vibrant marketplace where competition abounds, vendors offer training, and reputation counts.\nThose looking to attack someone with a DDoS can choose a vendor, indicate how many bots they want to purchase for an attack, specify how long they want access to them, and what country or countries they want them to reside in. The more options and the larger the pool, the more the service costs. Overall, the costs are now reasonable. If the attacker wants to own the bots used in the DDoS onslaught, according to SecureWorks, a centrally-controlled network could be purchased in 2014 for $4-12/thousand unique hosts in Asia, $100-$120 in the UK, or $140 to $190 in the USA.\nAlso according to SecureWorks, in late 2014 anyone could purchase a DDoS training manual for $30 USD. Users could utilize single tutorials for as low as $1 each. After training, users can rent attacks for between $3 to $5 by the hour, $60 to $90 per day, or $350 to $600 per week.\nSince 2014, the prices declined by about 5% per year due to bot availability and competing firms’ pricing pressures.\n [You might also like: Darknet: A One-Stop Shop for Would-Be Criminals]\nThe Explosion of Connected (IoT) Devices\nBotnets were traditionally composed of endpoint systems (PCs, laptops, and servers) but the rush for connected homes, security systems, and other non-commercial devices created a new landing platform for attackers wishing to increase their bot volumes. These connected devices generally have low security in the first place and are habitually misconfigured by users, leaving the default access credentials open through firewalls for remote communications by smart device apps. To make it worse, once created and deployed, manufactures rarely produce any patches for the embedded OS and applications, making them ripe for compromise. A recent report distributed by Forescout Technologies identified how easy it was to compromise home IoT devices, especially security cameras. These devices contributed to the creation and proliferation of the Mirai botnet. It was wholly comprised of IoT devices across the globe. Attackers can now rent access to 100,000 IoT-based Mirai nodes for about $7,500.\nWith over 6.4 billion IoT devices currently connected and an expected 20 billion devices to be online by 2020, this IoT botnet business is booming.\nThe Spread of Cryptocurrency\nTo buy a service, there must be a means of payment. In the underground no one trusts credit cards. PayPal was an okay option, but it left a significant audit trail for authorities. The rise of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin provides an accessible means of payment without a centralized documentation authority that law enforcement could use to track the sellers and buyers. This is perfect for the underground market. So long as cryptocurrency holds its value, the dark web economy has a transactional basis to thrive.\nSummary\nDDoS is very disruptive and relatively inexpensive. The attack on security journalist Brian Krebs’s blog site in September of 2016 severely impacted his anti-DDoS service providers’ resources. The attack lasted for about 24 hours, reaching a record bandwidth of 620Gbps. This was delivered entirely by a Mirai IoT botnet. In this particular case, it is believed that the original botnet was created and controlled by a single individual so the only cost to deliver it was time. The cost to Krebs was just a day of being offline.\nKrebs is not the only one to suffer from DDoS. In attacks against Internet reliant companies like Dyn, which caused the unavailability of Twitter, the Guardian, Netflix, Reddit, CNN, Etsy, Github, Spotify, and many others, the cost is much higher. Losses can reach multi- millions of dollars. This means a site that costs several thousands of dollars to set up and maintain and generates millions of dollars in revenue can be taken offline for a few hundred dollars, making it a highly cost-effective attack. With low cost, high availability, and a resilient control infrastructure, it is sure that DDoS is not going to fade away, and some groups like Deloitte believe that attacks in excess of 1Tbps will emerge in 2017. They also believe the volume of attacks will reach as high as 10 million in the course of the year. Companies relying on their web presence for revenue need to strongly consider their DDoS attack prevention strategy to understand how they are going to defend themselves to stay afloat.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"The Cost of a DDoS Attack on the Darknet\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/cost-of-ddos-attack-darknet/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"David Monahan\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ddos-get-worse.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 960,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-03-15\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-03-15\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155 \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Darknet\', \'ddos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/cost-of-ddos-attack-darknet/');

Four days is also about the number of days it takes to recover from sleep deprivation, work backlog, and the general buzz that one experiences by being part of the spectacle as grand and electrifying as Mobile World Congress.\nThe nice part about reflecting on MWC 2017 is that it is very easy to select a handful of themes that permeated throughout all the exhibition halls, keynotes, and hallway chatter. For me, this is the list: IoT, 5G, Virtualization, and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\nIoT (Internet of Things)\nWhereas last year there were many IoT demonstrations attempting to describe the âwhat-ifâ scenarios in different vertical markets (from smart cities to smart farms), 2017 brought hard-and-fast applications to the forefront.Â  Among these was the connected car concept (see âBeep beep at MWC17â) that featured an ecosystem including large automakers such as BMW and Ford, operators such as Verizon and SK Telecom, and building-block vendors such as Intel and Qualcomm.Â  Security in the era of IoT now becomes an important consideration. With ubiquitous connectivity comes a complex obligation for Service Providers â namely, to protect all the net-enabled devices from malicious security attacks, as well as protecting the network itself from all those devices that can act as the attacker â independently or as an army.Â  Vendors and Carriers alike discussed how to actively monitor and manage security in a completely connected world where billions of IoT devices dwarf the number of connected humans.\n5G\nMWC would hardly be worth its splendor were it not for a large component of the show focused on 5G mobile technology and the showâs annual mainstay â the new releases of mobile gadgets and devices. Â Â 5G is still a work-in-progress from a standards perspective, but with plans to handle data speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G while offering lower latency and higher capacity, carriers cannot afford to stand on the sidelines messaging their 5G product and services readiness, assuming mass rollout takes hold within the next couple years.Â  NTT in fact said they will have 5G deployed in 2020 at the Olympics in Tokyo. In fact, the Tier 1 North American Carriers, Verizon and AT&T, made noise about pre-commercial launches in the U.S. for 5G based fixed wireless broadband service.\n [You might also like: Mobile World Congress 2016 Recap]\nVirtualization\nYears ago the vendor community responded to the Carriersâ demand for networks to become virtual â including everything from the Radio Access Network (RAN) to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC).Â  This year, many vendors have done a good job addressing second-level problems beyond ditching the proprietary hardware â problems like how to orchestrate and secure large scale virtual networks.Â  Radware featured the concept of using the Network-as-a-sensor, with the main tenet being distributed, virtual DDoS attack detection components pop-corned (itâs my blog so I can use a made-up word) across the network to provide a rich telemetry set, from which the network can learn and apply policy.Â  This concept bleeds into the next MWC theme, artificial intelligence.\nArtificial Intelligence\nAI is not new â arguably it has been around since the mid-20th century, and at least as long as weâve seen automated robots in manufacturing and in our homes (if mom is reading this, Iâm still waiting for the Robie Junior from Radio Shack that I didnât get for Christmas in 1986!). In the context of MWC, most of the AI messaging was around machine-learning or intelligent assist for things like smartphone apps, big data network analytics for performance monitoring, problem isolation, and network recovery automation.Â  From a security angle, it means that if a network attack causes a performance problem or full outage, there is a cyber control plane crunching data to take the appropriate healing or mitigation response.\nIn all, MWC2017 felt different than previous years because there seemed to be a shift from what were nascent and nebulous technologies to what now are promising and pragmatic consumer products ripe to change the way we communicate.\n\n\nRead the eBook “Agility, Scalability, Automation: Accelerating the Benefits of NFV with a Cap-and-Grow Strategy” to learn more. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'5G\', \'AI\', \'Artificial Intelligence\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mobile world congress\', \'MWC201', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/mobile-world-congress/');

These threats attempt to penetrate our defenses using exploits and application vulnerabilities. Our firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), DDoS mitigation solutions, and other security technologies detect and block these external threats.\nStupid is as stupid does\nLately, we have been hearing a lot about ransomware, phishing, spear-phishing, clickbait, and other methods hackers are using to gain access to networks and sensitive information. These techniques rely on social engineering instead of technological ingenuity and the success rate is much higher than one would think.\nThe hacker is sending information that looks legitimate to the user. This could be an email, a website, or could even be a phone call directly to the targeted victim. In reality, the information is not legitimate and is designed to convince the user to do something that gives the hacker access to their computer or certain parts of the network and applications. The user might click on a link in an email, go to a compromised website, or even send username/password credentials to the hacker.\n [You might also like: Profile of a Hacker]\nNo one is immune to these threats no matter their position or technical expertise. Everyone from the data entry clerk up to the CEO have been targeted and given the hackers access to their IT infrastructure. Targeted social engineering is much more successful than probing a network for known vulnerabilities.\nEveryone is vulnerable to these social engineering attacks. It is impossible to train every person to be 100 percent effective at detecting and blocking these hacker threats. Fortunately, IT solutions exist to protect the network from users accidentally (or purposefully) performing malicious activities. Outbound inspection solutions are available to monitor what the users are accessing on the internet and whether the site, content, or activity is legitimate.\nX-ray vision for everyone\nThere are different solutions including next generation firewalls (NGFW), IPS, antivirus/antimalware, data loss prevention (DLP) that can be used to inspect the external communications to detect and block these threats. It is likely that a combination of these solutions is necessary to properly protect the IT assets.\nUnfortunately, it is becoming harder for these solutions to do their job because an increasing amount of traffic going to and from the internet is encrypted. The decryption of this traffic is resource intensive and each security solution needs to perform the decryption, inspection, and re-encryption of the data.\nIT architectures need a solution that can provide visibility into the content of the user sessions for all of the security technologies. Then, this solution can steer the visible content to all of the appropriate security solutions before re-encrypting it to make its way to the destination on the internet.\nProtect in both directions\nApplication delivery controllers (ADC) are designed to deliver this functionality. As a reverse-proxy for application servers, they support high performance encryption, provide the load balancing of services, and they can service chain multiple security applications. If we turn the ADC around so that the applications are on the internet, the ADC becomes a forward proxy performing outbound SSL inspection with the multiple security solutions.\nThe outbound SSL inspection solution can protect your network from the biggest security threat – your internal users. The integration of the ADC with security technologies as an outbound SSL inspection solution provides the visibility and reliability businesses need to protect their networks from their employees and users – the internal human threat.\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'application delivery\', \'application delivery controllers\', \'Hackers\', \'hacks\', \'IT\', \'Outbou', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2017/03/network-security-not-matter-invite-hacker-inside/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (156, 'CDN Security is NOT Enough for Today', 'David Hobbs', '2017-3-8', 'Today, many organizations are now realizing that DDoS defense is critical to maintaining an exceptional customer experience. Why? Because nothing diminishes load times or impacts the end users’ experience more than a cyber-attack, which is the silent killer of application performance.\nAs high-availability and high performance distributors of content to end-users, CDNs can serve as a lynchpin in the customer experience. Yet new vulnerabilities in CDN networks have left many wondering if the CDNs themselves are vulnerable to a wide variety of cyber-attacks, such as forward loop assaults.\nSo what types of attacks are CDNs vulnerable too? Here are top 5 cyber threats that threaten CDNs so you can safeguard against them.\n\nBlind Spot #1: Dynamic Content Attacks\nAttackers have learned that a significant blind spot in CDN services are the treatment of dynamic content requests. Since the dynamic content is not stored on CDN servers, all the requests for dynamic content are sent to the origin’s servers. Attackers are taking advantage of this behavior and they generate attack traffic that contains random parameters in the HTTP GET requests. CDN servers immediately redirect this attack traffic to the origin, expecting the origin’s server to handle the requests. But, in many cases, the origin’s servers do not have the capacity to handle all those attack requests and they fail to provide online services to legitimate users, creating a denial-of-service situation.\nMany CDNs have the ability to limit the number of dynamic requests to the server under attack. This means that they cannot distinguish attackers from legitimate users and the rate limit will result in legitimate users being blocked.\nBlind Spot #2: SSL-based attacks\nSSL-based DDoS attacks target the secured online services of the victim. These attacks are easy to launch and difficult to mitigate, making them attackers’ favorites. In order to detect and mitigate DDoS SSL attacks, CDN servers must first decrypt the traffic using the customer’s SSL keys. If the customer is not willing to provide the SSL keys to its CDN provider, then the SSL attack traffic is redirected to the customer’s origin, leaving the customer vulnerable to SSL attacks. SSL attacks that hit the customer’s origin can easily take down the secured online service.\nDuring DDoS attacks when WAF technologies are involved, CDN networks also have a significant weakness in terms of the number of SSL connections per second from a scalability capability, and serious latency issues can arise.\n [You might also like: WAF and DDoS – Perfect Bedfellows: Every Business Owner Must Read.]\nPCI and other security compliance issues are also a problem as sometimes this limits the data centers that are able to be used to service the customer, as not all CDN providers are PCI compliant across all datacenters. This can again increase latency and cause audit issues.\nBlind Spot #3: Attacks on non-CDN services\nCDN services are often offered only for HTTP/S and DNS applications. Other online services and applications in the customer’s data center such as VoIP, mail, FTP and proprietary protocols are not served by the CDN and therefore traffic to those applications is not routed through the CDN. In addition, many web-based applications are also not served by CDNs. Attackers are taking advantage of this blind spot and launch attacks on applications that are not routed through the CDN, hitting the customer origin with largescale attacks that threaten to saturate the Internet pipe of the customer. Once the Internet pipe is saturated, all the applications at the customer’s origin become unavailable to legitimate users, including the ones that are served by the CDN.\nBlind Spot #4: Direct IP Attacks\nEven applications that are serviced by a CDN can be attacked once the attackers launch a direct attack on the IP address of the web servers at the customer origin. These can be network based floods such as UDP floods or ICMP floods that will not be routed through CDN services, and will directly hit the servers of the customer at the origin. Such volumetric network attacks can saturate the internet pipe, resulting in taking down all the applications and the online services of the origin, including the ones that are served by the CDN. Often misconfiguration of “shielding” the data center can leave the applications directly vulnerable to attack.\nBlind Spot #5: Web Application Attacks\nCDN protection for web applications threats is limited and exposes the web applications of the customer to data leakage, data thefts and other threats that are common with web applications. Most CDN-based web application firewall capabilities are minimal, covering only a basic set of predefined signatures and rules. Many of the CDN-based WAFs do not learn HTTP parameters, do not create positive security rules and therefore it cannot protect from zero day attacks and known threats. For the companies that DO provide tuning for the web applications in their WAF, the cost is extremely high to get this level of protection.\nIn addition to the significant blind spots identified earlier, most CDN security services are not responsive enough, resulting in security configurations that take hours to manually deploy and to spread across all its network servers. The security services are using outdated technology such as rate limit that was proven to be inefficient during the last attack campaigns, and it lacks capabilities such as network behavioral analysis, challenge – response mechanisms and more.\n \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'WAF\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/cdn-security-not-enough-today/');

As sectors move closer to the red center, organizations in these sectors are more likely to experience a denial-of-service or other cyber-related attack at a higher frequency then the others.Â  Mitigation assumptions should move in lockstep with the risk level. When this does not happen, the likelihood of a cyber-attack resulting in a data center outage or service degradation increases drastically. Organizations in the center are wise to take swift actionâadjusting mitigation strategies and solutions to reflect the new risk level from threat actors.\nThere have been a few changes to the Ring of Fire since last yearâs report. Telecom, government institutions and gaming companies have stayed at the center of likelihood while the financial services industry has moved toward the center. Retail, education and healthcare industries remain stable, but technology companies are moving away from the center. Energy and utility companies remain in the low risk level due to tighter security. In addition to industry, company size can be a predictor of likelihood to be attacked. The larger the business, the greater the chance.\nThis yearâs likelihood for high risk included financial services, government & civil services, service providers and the gaming industry. Education was a high risk last year but has since slipped down to a medium risk. In 2016 the financial sector saw several different vectors of attack launched against the industry, making it the most targeted sector. Denial-of-service was one of the more popular vectors and a persistent one, as Anonymous carried out OpIcarus, a year-long operation designed to target financial institutions. Government service came under heavy fire due to hacktivist and state-sponsored attacks. Anonymous operations such as OpRight2Rest, OpGaston and OpLGBT targeted several government services as a reaction to political events. Service providers have found themselves in a high-risk spot since they are not just a primary target, but also a secondary target for massive DDoS campaigns. Attackers tend to target companies directly with network and applications floods. However, when the volume exceeds the infrastructure capacity, they begin to create trouble for the âneighborhoodâ as the network pipes become saturated. For the gaming industry, large-scale DDoS attacks resulting in network outages and service degradation have become everyday occurrences. The main motivation is simply the thrill of disrupting game play and tournaments. A secondary driver: trolling crucial moments when gamers are trying to take advantage of game specials and bonus points.\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nThis yearâs likelihood for medium risk included retail, health and education. Education slipped this year to a medium risk, but still dealt with several threats. This year the educational system came under fire as vendors on the Darknet began offering school hacking services.Â  This year we also saw 444 school networks in Japan go offline simultaneously in a massive cyber-attack.Â  In most cases, itâs either a student looking to delay a test or manipulate the registration process, or a personal attack by a student or staff member in aggression towards the school. The healthcare industry has found itself under attack this year for several different reasons. This year we have seen an actor named The Dark Overlord on the Darknet leak several hospital databases, and Anonymous hacked into the database of multiple Turkish hospitals and medical institutions. The attackers ultimately gained control of patient records in retaliation for a series of attacks on U.S. hospitals in the form of ransomware attacks earlier this year. Retailers have been the target of a wide range of DDoS and Ransom Denial-of-Service (RDoS) attacks over the past few years. The results are network outages that prevent customers from purchasing items, thus leading to a loss in revenue.Â  In Switzerland this year, the website for Swiss Federal Railway (SBB) and two of the country’s largest retailers, Coop and Migros, had their websites taken down, preventing customers from accessing their sites.Â  These DDoS attacks on retailers are often a smokescreen for more sinister acts like DDoS for ransom or large scale data breaches targeting payment systems and customer data.\nThis yearâs likelihood for low risk includes energy & utilities and technology companies.Â  Technology companies are targeted often but remain a low risk due to the nature of these businesses.Â  Most technology companies are aware of the threat model they face and have taken steps to prepare for a cyber-attack.Â  Some have even begun offering bug bounty programs in an attempt discover bugs before criminals do. For the energy and utility companies, the threat landscape remains stable due to segregation of most of these companyâs networks. Even so, this industry remains a valid target for hacktivist due to environmental concerns.\nLearn more about Radwareâs Ring of Fire in our comprehensive 2016-2017 ERT Report.\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattacks\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'Risk\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/03/dont-fall-ring-fire/');

Digital transformation is the change associated with the application of digital technology in all aspects of human society. Digital transformation inherently enables new types of innovation and creativity to increase business competency rather than simply going paperless.\nRuba Borno PhD, Vice President Cisco Growth Initiatives, shared Cisco’s vision that the only future-proofed solution for digital transformation is a next-generation secure network. Security is no longer static, and securing all the organization’s access points is no simple task. IoT, mobile work force, cloud applications and increased sophistication of attackers and attack methods require better preparation. Organizations need to fundamentally change how they build, manage and secure networks.\nDigital transformation was the apparent theme across this year’s Cisco Live Berlin. With security becoming the key enabler for any organization IT investment, this paper covers the key trends in securing the digital transformation, along with new solutions announcements covered at Cisco Live Berlin 2017.\nAttackers Are Relentless; Defenders Are Tired\nAttackers have infinite time to plan their next attack: choose a victim, gather intelligence, select the right attack tools, test them, coordinate an attack and then launch the attack at their convenience. There are plenty of attack tools available at the Clearnet and the Darknet, and there are plenty of opportunities to strike again and again – till success.\nDefenders, on the other hand, have to overcome every attack attempt. They do not have a second chance. They have limited budget, their job is at stake, and they need to keep up with education, training, selecting the right solutions and maintaining an effective security posture.\nThis is where the difference between detection and protection becomes critical. To protect against attacks you need first to detect that you are under attack. Security solutions often focus on shortening the time to detect. Yet, they also need to shorten the time to protect – this is where automation becomes important. Solutions that automate more stages of the attack lifecycle will be more successful in dealing with the more dynamic, automated attacks organizations experience today.\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nRansomware Becomes a Major Threat\nI urge you to watch ransomware – an anatomy of an attack. This video, played at multiple Cisco Live sessions, provides an insight to an attacker’s daily work. It is about the details. The attacker does not need to develop any tool or software. They only need to select the right tools from an endless variety and use them smartly.\nDDoS attacks have also joined the mix of ransom attacks by slowing down organization operations and even completely shutting down their online presence.\nWhat can you do against ransomware? Although widely discussed during multiple sessions at Cisco Live Berlin 2017, I have not seen a solution that is truly designed to address this threat. Cisco speakers discussed a multi-layered security approach where they highlighted some capabilities in their solutions that can help improve a business security posture against the ransom threat.\nWhat can you do to fight this threat? As always, prevention is the key. And prevention is about education, education and again – education. Attackers lure employees to open unsolicited mails, download software updates and harness multiple social engineering techniques. You need to be more suspicious and ask yourself if this is a safe operation beforehand.\nDDoS Attacks Are On the Rise\nWe know how to protect endpoints – desktops, laptops and other mobile devices. We know how to protect our enterprise network. We use firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, anti-virus, anti-malware and other perimeter network security solutions.\nWhat we do not know is how to protect infrastructure against DDoS attacks. Data centers, service providers and cloud providers are all vulnerable to network flood attacks. The recent Dyn attack and the celebrity Mirai botnet are clear reminders that we need to get ready.\nIoT is a real threat. We are adding 1 million devices per hour to the internet and the majority of them are directly accessible with no or limited security measures. A 1 terabit-per-second DDoS attack is expected this year 2017.\nWe need to think differently. DDoS attacks are not a problem of specific organizations. It is a problem of the community. Attack mitigation should start at the service providers’ network and leverage to the enterprise data center. It should be more simple and manageable.\n\nEffective Security: Keep It Simple\nDigitization has created unprecedented growth opportunities. With more than 50 billion connected devices estimated by 2020 (According to Cisco), business leaders are questioning how new digital trends will impact their business — but so are the active adversaries seeking to profit from well-organized cybercrime operations. As the attack surface continues to expand, so has the need for a more effective approach to security.\nAccording to Cisco, a typical organization deploys some 50 different security devices and solutions in their network and data centers. Every new solution contributes an incremental level of security; however, it increases network complexity exponentially. The challenge of effective security is not what to secure, but how to manage it?\nThe answer is keeping it simple. Security that is integrated, automated and simple to manage will be foundational to the success of digital businesses as they work to deliver protection from the network to the mobile user and the cloud — wherever employees work and data resides.\nDid I mention automation? David Ulevitch, VP Cisco Security Business Group, discussed automation. His view is that the only way to win the cyber war is through automation: let the machines run the machines.\nThis is the path to effective security. It’s a continuous process, not a one-time effort.\n [You might also like: Validating Cisco’s Threat-Centric Security Solutions]\nCloud Is the Secret Weapon\nThe secret weapon in our security toolbox is the cloud. Why? Here are few arguments:\na) Cloud offers elastic and unlimited resources. You can use compute and storage for data collection and analytics to look at user behavior. This helps you make the right security decision per user, per transaction or per location.\nb) Cloud offers the ideal management and control for all enterprise applications – on premises and in the cloud.\nLook for cloud as an integrated solution. If the vendor offers you APIs – move on. You do not have the time or the resources to use APIs.\nACI at New Heights\nI recall John Chamber’s keynote from Cisco Live 2015, where he admitted that Cisco was late in identifying the SDN (Software-Defined Network) market. John promised that Cisco was going to fix that. Indeed Cisco introduced its flavor for software-defined networking called Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). ACI is Cisco’s foundation for the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) initiative.\nAt the event, Cisco announced that it further expands ACI – turning it from a pure data center solution to a multi-site solution. Cisco introduced multiple data-center automation tools, further empowered its ACI ecosystem with more than 65 technology partners and launched a new ACI marketplace so users can share their ACI applications and blueprints.\nWhy Cisco leaders believe that ACI will win the SDDC market? Because it is application-centric and introduces operational simplicity.

Everyone will remember the epic attacks against Krebs, OVH and Dyn last year. DDoS attacks with new historical volumes of up to and beyond 600Gbps performed by large armies of 100,000s of IoT devices. The Mirai botnet played a lead role in these attacks. Mirai was devised to target and infect IoT devices which have their telnet access open and which can be easily compromised through factory default credentials. The deplorable security posture of IoT devices such as IP cameras and DVRs provide for easy victims. The fault is not on the consumer or the end-users; some of the devices would not even allow a user to change the factory default credentials through the admin GUI or even allow disabling of the telnet service. While consumers are not aware of the dangers of deploying the new smart technology that are invading their homes, they are exposing themselves to cyber-attacks and cyber ransom campaigns, while at the same time participating in the large scale DDoS attacks against online businesses and corporations.\nStill today, and Iâm sure for next couple of months, we are discovering new strains of Mirai as well as new botnets that are using techniques introduced by Mirai. Only few days ago researchers found a Windows malware that is supposed to provide a helper function to accelerate the harvesting of new victims for Mirai botnets. The Windows malware does not expose any bot-like behavior, all it does is scan for new victims and report them to the scan and load service from the Mirai botnet.\nMid 2016, we saw a CCTV botnet that was comprised of 25,000 devices. Dyn reportedly was hit by 100,000 devices. We have evidence of a Darknet Jabber campaign that offered DDoS services through a botnet consisting of 400,000 devices, and in November of 2016 there was the attempt to infect 900,000 DT residential routers. At this growth rate, we cannot begin to imagine what sizes botnets will become as we move through 2017. One thing is sure, there is an army of zombies out there consisting of numerous IoT devices that are available 24/7 and that are the venerable targets for multiple botnets. The only limitation on the botnets is how they are defeated by their competing botnets. Devices are infected and re-infected, so there is effectively a war of the bots ongoing and IoT is the platform they are fighting on and for.\nAnalysts expect up to 20 billion, some say 50 billion, smart devices to be connected by 2020. At the rate the threat is growing and the growth rate of IoT devices, we cannot ignore this trend and we should all be aware of it and protect ourselves accordingly. At least until IoT manufacturers start implementing adequate security measures.\n [You might also like: The Rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)]\nNot all is lost though. For example, on January 5th of this year the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against D-Link to take them to court, accusing them of having failed to take reasonable steps to secure its routers and IP cameras, potentially compromising sensitive customer information.\nAccording to the complaint they filed, D-Link did not address well-known security flaws including hard-coded credentials, command injection flaws and mishandling of private signing keys for the firmware, among others.\nWe expect threats to be evolving as well. What we are seeing today is the first generation of IoT botnets. As hackers start to harness the power of their botnets, we expect to see much more sophisticated attacks at high volumes. Before the IoT botnet attackers took recourse by way of amplification to perform volumetric attacks, which limited their payload to single queries and specific protocols. As hackers get access to larger botnets they are not limited anymore by simple attack vectors and they can now launch very sophisticated attacks at high volumes.\nWe covered the threat landscape, what are trends in the Darknet for 2017? Any change in how hackers organize themselves and how they evolve?\nThe Darknet is a thriving and mature economy with vendors doing research and developing new innovative tools, service providers offering Darknet hosting and XaaS, combined with healthy consumer and customer ecosystem which pay and (ab)use the services offered for differing motivations.\nLast year we have seen growing numbers of Booter and Stresser services or DDoS-for-hire on the Dark- as well as the Clearnet. Lately, more of those DDoS-for-hire platforms are built around IoT botnets. As dark vendors are competing, they innovate, automate and invest in better tools and better user experience. We even noticed the use of evaluation systems, allowing users to rate the service and provide feedback. This provides for a thriving dark economy with a high level of maturity.\nIn 2016, the Shenron attack tool provided access to botnets with a potential of 500Gbps DDoS traffic to customers for monthly prices ranging from $20 to $1,000 USD. The vDOS booter service had similar pricing and competed with Shenron, providing paying customers with the tools to launch high volume DDoS attacks against targets of their choice. In the case of the vDoS booter service, the two young owners made over $600,000 and have helped their customers to perform over 150,000 DDoS attacks in the course of two years. The vDoS owners were a victim of a hack themselves and their secrets were exposed publicly. These are two of the better known services on the Darknet because their owners have been arrested and their details exposed, but there are many, many more.\nWhat are the motives behind attack campaigns? What drives hackers to continue to invest in tools or their customers pay for the use of DDoS services?\nThe number one motive by far is ransom, with Europe leading that statistic. Our 2016-2017 ERT threat report shows that ransom is the motivation behind 41% of the attacks worldwide and 49% of the attacks in Europe. Through the use of paying DDoS services, bad actors are devising ransom schemes that take businesses offline that do not pay up. The typical method of operating is sending the victim a message that a DDoS attack will take place at a specific time unless the victim pays a certain amount of Bitcoins. To provide proof of their capabilities, a lower volume, short-lived DDoS attack typically follows the message.\n [You might also like: Darknet: A One-Stop Shop for Would-Be Criminals]\nOther more sophisticated attacks, which are targeting intellectual property or corporate secrets, are making use of DDoS as a smokescreen to hide their intrusion and the exfiltration of data.\nThe rest of the motivations vary at similar prevalence across all companies, whether this is insider threat, hacktivism, competition, cyberwar or angry users.\nThe #1 motivator is and will be money!\nHow should people protect themselves against this growing number of DDoS ransom attacks?\nThe previously mentioned DDoS attacks are typically of volumetric nature. Volumetric attacks will saturate the internet links of the victim, requiring a cloud-based scrubbing service with an abundance of throughput, and distributed across the globe to mitigate as close as possible to the source of the problem. Radware provides always-on and on-demand Cloud DDoS Services with automatic or manual redirection of traffic through our cloud scrubbing centers across the world. On-demand services can be combined with our on-premise DDoS protection solution, which mitigates low and slow attacks and volumetric attacks that are not saturating the internet link.\nOur ERT threat report indeed indicates that still 5 out of 6 businesses struggle daily with low profile DDoS attacks that are below 1Gbps but consume enough resources of the network and server infrastructure to result in poor service levels and customer experience. Low and slow attacks, even if they are not making the headlines, are a serious threat and should not be taken for granted. Our on-premise DDoS mitigation devices provide protection against any type of attack. Our behavioral detection algorithms are able to detect malicious traffic and differentiate the good from the bad, even in burst traffic conditions where there is a high volume of good traffic, the device still operates without false positives. Our automatic mitigation provides signatures to block malicious attacks without false positives within 18 seconds. When the attack is morphing, a feedback loop ensures the signature is adapted to the changing thread, providing continuous and automated protection. For total protection against all potential DDoS attacks, the on-premise DDoS mitigation is combined with a cloud service in an integrated hybrid solution. Through Radwareâs unique defense messaging protocol, the on-prem and cloud mitigation solutions are continuously synchronized in terms of base lines and attack mitigation signatures. In the event of increasing volume in attack traffic, all traffic is redirected through the cloud scrubbing center and the mitigation takes effect immediately, while most competing solutions need to detect and learn the traffic patterns again from scratch before they effectively start mitigating.\nThe Dyn attack affected 6% of the Fortune 500 companies such as Amazon, Netflix, Twitter, CNN, Spotifyâ¦ How can people protect themselves against these attacks?\nShortly after the Krebs and OVH attacks, a dark agent going by the name of Anna-Senpai published the source code for Mirai, the botnet used in the epic attacks against Krebs, OVH, Dyn and later also DT. We took advantage of the availability of this code to build our own botnet in our labs. We studied Mirai and its attacks carefully and provided detection signatures as early as November for our DefensePro products so that customers were protected from most of the Mirai attacks.\nWe didnât stop there, and we changed Mirai to include new attack vectors that we expect attackers to add in the future, and we tested extensively with our solutions to find better ways to improve our detection and mitigation algorithms.\nIn the specific case of the Dyn attack, one of the original nine attack vectors used was the DNS water torture attack. DNS water torture is a difficult attack to mitigate without taking down a full domain or rate limiting requests in DNS servers. It affects organizations that host the authoritative DNS servers of a domain. For security reasons, organizations such as financial institutions prefer to host themselves their authoritative DNS servers and they should be provided with an adequate solution for this problem. This is why we worked on new ways to mitigate DNS attacks, which resulted in new patented technologies that will shortly be introduced in our DDoS mitigation solutions.\n [You might also like: 2016: The Year of Cyber Ransom]\n\nYou mentioned DT, and most of us will remember the impact on the residential internet access when DT suffered from an attack by Mirai last year. Was this also a DDoS attack comparable to the Dyn attack?\nThe impact DT suffered was the result of a failed infection attempt. The Mirai code was adapted to use a new infection vector through a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the NTP server name field of residential routers through the TR-069 protocol. Routers such as the Eir D1000, the Zyxel AMG1302 and the D-Link DSL3780 were known to be vulnerable at the time. The takeover attempt failed, causing the routers to reboot and ultimately lead to 900,000 consumer devices losing internet connectivity. DT was very prompt on mitigating the issue through firmware updates to close the vulnerability. In some dark way, the outage was a blessing â imagine the infection succeeded without any interruption in service, we would be faced by a 900,000-device botnet… Now take into account the fact that these 900,000 consumer routers are less than 5% of the DTâs landline customers. You can image the threat we are facing.\nEarlier this year the average volume of encrypted traffic surpassed the average of unencrypted volume according to Mozilla. In which ways does this affect the threat landscape and how should people protect themselves?\nYes, the internet is going dark, more and more traffic is being encrypted using SSL/TLS. Mass adoption of technologies is always followed closely by efforts to exploit it. SSL is no exception and has experienced a large number of highly publicized vulnerabilities. Beside the data compromising vulnerabilities, SSL DDoS and DoS attacks target the SSL handshake mechanism, send garbage data to the SSL server, or abuse functions related to the SSL encryption key negotiation process. SSL attacks are popular because they are asymmetric, each SSL session handshake consumes 15 times more resources from the server than it does from the client.\nFurthermore, with the increase of encrypted traffic on the internet, cyber attackers have found a new channel through which they can mask and further complicate attack detection in both network and application level threats.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nExisting attack mitigation solutions require real time visibility into traffic traveling through the network over encrypted outbound sessions where the organization may not have access to the serverâs encryption keys. This challenge is especially relevant for data leakage prevention (DLP), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and firewalls which normally do not have visibility into encrypted traffic, creating significant blind spots in the protection they provide. Furthermore, protecting inbound sessions requires each and every device that inspects the traffic to have the serverâs private keys, which can pose a burden on the management of more complex perimeters. Radware provides the SSL Clarity Perimeter gateway solution, which is a centralized SSL offload solution equipped with SSL acceleration engines and optimized for the task. It integrates seamlessly with the different perimeter security devices, offering minimal latency and requiring only a single decryption and encryption step of the session while passing traffic through multiple inspection hops. Centralizing the SSL handling of traffic also minimizes the management and exposure of the serverâs private keys to a single device. The same SSL Clarity Perimeter Gateway solution is able to overcome the issues of outbound sessions by effectively operating as a man-in-the-middle, masquerading as legitimate servers using dynamically generated server certificates based on a common corporate CA certificate that is trusted by the clients.\nRadware also provides unique SSL capabilities for the mitigation of SSL denial of service attacks in the cloud, and on premise. When outsourcing a service in the cloud, most organizations are reluctant to provide visibility into clear traffic. Radware is the only vendor providing a solution based on SSL challenge/response, using dummy certificates to mitigate SSL renegotiation attacks without requiring access to the serverâs private keys or having to decrypt the applicationâs traffic.\nBesides the trends in threat landscape, what will be top of mind for security managers and CISOs this year?\nThe General Data Protection Regulation that will apply from May 25th, 2018 is top of mind in every CISOâs security strategy and budget for 2017. In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the data protection rules in the EU. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the largest reform in data protection law in the past 20 years. The objective of the new set of rules is to give back control to EU citizens over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for business through making it consistent across EU member states. The regulation provides protection concerning the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data.\nThe GDPR is a whole new set of regulatory rules and measures to comply with and implement by any organization that controls or processes any form of personal data. Personal data is to be interpreted in the wide sense of the term and pertains to any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life and can be anything from a name, a picture, an email address, financial details, posts on social networks, or even a computerâs IP address. Not abiding to the GDPR will be met with enforced action including fines of up to â¬ 20,000,000 or 4% of the annual worldwide revenue when facing a breach of the data protection rules. The GDPR includes provisions that promote accountability and governance that can be audited with non-compliance, leading to administrative fines of up to â¬ 10,000,000 or 2% of annual worldwide revenue.\n [You might also like: WAF and DDoS Help You on the Road to GDPR Compliancy]\nWhenever a company wants to trade or do business with one or several of the EU Member States, it will have to prove adequacy â in other words, its data protection standards would have to be equivalent to the EUâs GDPR starting in May 2018. This virtually makes GDPR a global, worldwide regulation affecting organizations and businesses around the globe.\nFor online businesses and cloud service providers, GDPR compliance means adherence to the principles of âPrivacy by Designâ and âData Protection by Designâ during the design, development, implementation and deployment of web applications or services, and any components or services associated with them. With the rapid adoption of cloud services there is a heightened concern with regard to the readiness of these applications and services. A recent study conducted by Symantec/Bluecoat shows that 98% of todayâs cloud applications do not even come close to being GDPR-ready.\nBased on recital 39 of the GDPR, personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality, including preventing unauthorized access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. Recital 49 goes further by requiring the ability of a network or an information system to resist accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems. The recital literally says âThis could, for example, include preventing unauthorized access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping âdenial of serviceâ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems.â\nMost businesses will face the urgent need for increasing protection on published applications and services on all topics and purposes of Data Leak Prevention, Access Control, Web-based Attack Prevention and Denial-of-Service prevention. Leading providers of cloud and on-premise Web Application and API Protection services as well as on-demand, always-on cloud and hybrid Denial-of-Service mitigation services do provide an adequate solution for this acute need. A fully managed WAF and DDoS Cloud service provides a fast route to check off one of the regulatory compliance boxes and a worry-free GDPR compliance strategy.\nNow that we are on the topic of web applications, what are the trends and changes we might expect there?\nThe migration to the cloud continues and accelerates throughout 2017. As businesses move their core applications into the cloud, they find themselves in the position of having to secure them adequately. There are services provided by the cloud hosting providers, but most of them are sub-par in terms of breadth and depth and this is something we anticipated this year by launching our DDoS cloud solution integrated with AWS. Cloud WAF is another offering that allows our customers to manage their web application security without having two different vendors and technologies for on-prem and in the cloud applications. One of the major challenges of hybrid environments are the different security solutions for local and cloud applications and the management problem that is associated with this. Our Cloud WAF solution is based on the same technology we use in the data center, so policies can easily be migrated from and to the cloud, providing a seamless migration and experience for the customer.\n [You might also like: Hybrid Cloud â It is Not the Migration that Hurts]\nThe second trend is definitely DevOps. We are seeing more and more organizations adopting agile development and using Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines to deliver better customer experience and have shorter lead times to provide for needs of their customers. Half of the organizations that participated in our ERT report survey in 2016 have to accommodate multiple application changes per week while some of our customers undergo multiple application changes per day. This kind of agility within applications breaks the positive security policies of traditional web application protections. There is a need for web application security solutions that integrate and dynamically adapt with the application. This movement of securing the DevOps chain has been coined DevSecOps by Gartner. Our WAF solution provides an adaptive positive security policy as well as closed loop integrations with DAST tools to provide adequate protection without false positives in agile environments, where the application changes multiple times a day.\nTo end our interesting discussion, what is your final advice for security managers and CISOs as they go into 2017?\nStay focused and be prepared. Build a protection strategy and develop an adequate incident response plan, donât let yourself be taken by surprise!\nHackers are making extensive use of automation; they are using automation to orchestrate attacks from growing botnets and using it to create new, more sophisticated attacks that are changing over short periods of time, making them difficult to mitigate without automated mitigation solutions. The best way to fight automation is with automation! Make use of it to provide faster and better mitigation when under attack. Do not rely on manual signature crafting to provide attack mitigation; by the time the signature is in place, the attack will have morphed, requiring continual manual changes to the signature â and some attacks can go on like this for days! Only automatic signature generation and enforcement can provide adequate and timely mitigation.\nPrepare for the IoT tornado! Do not wait to put in place DDoS protection solutions on-prem, on-demand, hybrid or always-on cloud until you are the target of a ransom attack. No one can be considered exempt from ransom DDoS attacks.\nAnd finally, reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on your business by having an emergency response plan in place that allows you to restore operations quickly, and eliminate much of the costs associated with cyber-attacks. If you do not have an emergency response plan in place today, start planning for one right now!\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'ddos\', \'Hackers\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\',', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/02/10-cyber-security-questions/');

In fact, most organizations are now using—if not relying on—cloud-based applications to power operations. With this shift, IT infrastructures have become more distributed. Applications are now accessible from anywhere and personal devices are being used to conduct business. Together, these realities have blurred the boundaries of the traditional network perimeter.\nAttackers operate under a host of motivations—from hacktivism to monetary gain. No matter their intent, attackers benefit from the trend toward distributed IT, which increases the threat surface. Gone are the days when bolt-in and “afterthought” security architectures were sufficient. Static firewalls and intrusion detection or prevention solutions (IDS/IPS) woven around the asset simply cannot provide adequate protection. Such approaches work only in cases where they are fed with known protocol behaviors and known attacks. That’s because static firewalls and IDS/IPS solutions are not aware about the assets they protect. They are in the dark about network behavior—and are unable to protect against emerging attacks.\n\nIf those approaches don’t work, what does? Tech Mahindra sees a need to realign security architecture by focusing on ensuring application availability and preserving user experience while protecting applications from both volumetric DDoS attacks and exploitation of vulnerabilities. In designing such a strategy, there are two important prerequisites for success:\n\nKnow your assets. That includes such components as web interfaces, mobile interfaces, databases, development and test cycles, operating systems, where applications are deployed, and by whom and from where the infrastructure is being accessed. Understanding these variables is an important requirement for reducing the attack surface within in the environment.\n\n\nMap your risks—and take steps to reduce them. Often attack activity goes unnoticed for a significantly long period of time. Thus, it’s crucial to understand attackers: how attacks have evolved over the time, which direct and indirect strategies an attacker might unleash against assets and, as much as possible, the hacker “mindset” to help in identifying attacks that may have gone undetected and thwarting future attacks.\n\nWith applications updated frequently, development and test cycles have shortened, and workloads have become very dynamic. In many organizations, time-to-market pressures, lack of resources and lack of awareness and focus on security converge to create security gaps in applications. As a result, it has become critically important that security be highly adaptable—with continuous adjustments to address fast-changing applications and ever-changing threats. With an adaptive security approach, an organization can establish an effective security architecture for mitigating threats—both known and unknown.\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nTech Mahindra’s view on adaptive security\nAt Tech Mahindra, we see three key building blocks for adaptive security:\n\nContinuous proactive assessment. Adaptive security requires continuous assessment of an organization’s infrastructure and applications. Continuous assessment via manual and automated tools generates a security baseline that can be tracked and improved upon. With applications as key attack targets, the assessment must also evaluate the application development phase, thereby preventing vulnerabilities from creeping into the production environment. Recent attacks originated in IoT devices have illustrated the danger of device manufacturers failing to consider potential risks and vulnerabilities within their operating systems. Just as manufacturers are being held to higher standards, so should application developers. Incorporating security right from the start will help identify any vulnerabilities during the development stage so that sufficient controls, such as secure communication, authentication and authorization, can be integrated. In other words, when new code or a new application is deployed into production, it must pass through these security assessments.\n\n\nSituational awareness. Adaptive security must continually evolve at run time to address ever-changing application and user behaviors. Contextual information from continuous monitoring is a key input for an effective adaptive security strategy. With this approach, the security architecture is not entirely dependent on the traditional signature-based threat information but is instead based on real-time situational awareness. Continuously evolving security requires complete awareness of the assets – such as the core network, applications, endpoints – being protected and user behaviors related to those assets. If new code or a new application is deployed, the architecture detects the change and fine-tunes the policies vis-à-vis any new vulnerabilities. Volumetric DDoS attacks are a constant threat to online IT assets, with attackers typically merging malicious traffic with benign traffic (sometimes even using encrypted protocols). Thus, the ability to analyze traffic behavior and recognize user traffic patterns using various parameters, together with maximum detection accuracy, is key to dropping only malicious traffic and preventing any service degradation.\n\n\nAutomation. When organizations deploy best-of-breed security solutions, these solutions almost always operate in silos. Automation in security can enable organizations to design a security architecture where security functions coordinate with each other, share information and respond dynamically to attacks. For example, adaptive defense mechanisms can use signaling or other forms of messaging between security controls; they can auto-learn new attack patterns; and they can accelerate time to mitigation through real-time creation of protection. Ultimately, automation is about prevention versus detection—and it empowers organizations to secure themselves at the speed of attacks. Automation in security can enable siloed security modules to work as a synchronized system—operating with minimal intervention and significantly improving both incident response time and resource consumption.\n\nJust as dynamic business environments lead organizations to adapt, so does the threat landscape. With distributed, heterogeneous information architectures, application protection can no longer count on static models, but rather must include advanced mechanisms like real-time auto-learning and self-updating to provide seamless and continuous protection of an organization’s most critical digital assets.\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'adaptive security\', \'cybersecurity\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/02/adaptive-security-changing-threats-require-new-paradigm-protecting-cyber-assets/');

These are the pillars for higher learning, but have often been used to describe some open source projects and services that have the potential to be abused by those that are not so innocent. Over the last two years, tools like stressers, Remote Administration Tools (RAT) and ransomware have been published under these pretenses, but do they serve a legitimate purpose? These projects have set off an international debate in the information security community and many wonder if they should be available to the public. Often the justification for these projects is that they are intending to show the potential risks so they can be used to prevent infections or reduce potential damage. With stressers, they claim that the services are to be used to improve and test security products and to understand attack behavior targeting their network. But are they?\n\nRansomware has been at the center of this discussion for about two years now. Ransomware is a malicious type of software that is designed to lock users out of a computer system until the victim pays a ransom to the attacker, normally in Bitcoin. Reports from PhishMe suggest that in Q3 2016, 97% of all phishing emails contained ransomware, while a security expert who requested to stay anonymous told CSO Online that ransomware authors took in close to $1 Billion in 2016. Another group, Malware Hunter Team, reports that there are over 300 different ransomware variants in existence! This is truly a growing problem.\n \nSites like Github are important to programmers. It gives them the ability to showcase and publish their work, but some projects on the website can be easily used for malicious intent. In 2015 a user and security researcher Utku Sen published Hidden Tear, an open source ransomware project, on Github and argued that it was for educational purposes so students and other researchers could gain a deeper insight into how ransomware works. Others argued that this project laid out the basics for actual malware and those that couldnât create the software on their own could now do so. In the end, Hidden Tear was abandoned and ultimately detected by antivirus software. But the discussion doesnât stop there. In 2016, Bleeping Computerâs Lawrence Abrams spotted a strain of ransomware called Magic that had been built using an open source ransomware code, eda2, designed for educational purposes only.\nHidden Tear Legal Warning\nRecently Catalin Cimpanu from Bleeping Computers wrote about a service that I discovered called Ranion. Ranion offers Ransomware-as-a-Service on the Darknet and is labeled as âEducation purposes only.â The vendor clearly states that the service is for education purposes only but provides a fully functional piece of malware, including an anonymous command and control dashboard to manage your âclients,â also known as âvictimsâ. The vendor even goes as far to offer free customization and will not take any fees from your clients. The service sells for .95 BTC.\nRanion â Ransomware-as-a-Service\nItâs not just ransomware. On Github you can find several projects labeled as âeducational purposes onlyâincluding Remote Administration Tools (RATs), like Blackhole. The debate around these open source projects ultimately comes to two points. Those that are new to the industry or still students need to understand how these pieces of malware work by live examples in lab environments, while others like myself say that publishing such tools lowers the entry level for those wishing to pursue criminal activity. \n [You might also like: The Rise of Booter and Stresser Services]\nA similar issue exists with stresser services, otherwise known as the DDoS-as-a-Service industry. A stresser is an online service designed to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Users normally purchase packages based on how large of an attack they want to launch, vectors they wish to use and the duration in which their membership will last. These web based services that offer DDoS-for-hire are priced very low, as little as $19 a month, and can deliver over 1Gbps with multiple vectors. Hidden inside the terms of services are sections designed to place liability in the hands of their users. Normally along the lines of âPermission is granted to stress test dedicated servers and networks owned by youâ in the case of Kronos Booter, but these services never check to see if the tester owns the site targeted in the DDoS attack.  \nKronos Booter Terms of Service\nWhile several legitimate services do exist for companies wishing to test their new DDoS mitigation devices, most of these illegitimate stresser services are abused by lower-level criminals looking to target corporate networks and gaming services.  Once only advertised in underground forums, they have now become very public with hundreds of services to select from by simply searching on Google for stresser or booter. These sites are often run by teenagers or young adults who donât know what they are doing. Often, they are just copy-paste clones from posts found in underground forums. One of the main issues is the profit behind these services. Stresser services can launch thousands of attacks a week for illegitimate purposes, making the owners tens of thousands of dollars in the process. \nA bigger issue is the traffic that is generated from these services. Many of the attack vectors offered for these services rely on reflection techniques that use vulnerable 3rd party DNS or NTP servers to amplify their attack.  Even in the case of renting botnets like Mirai or other Internet of Things (IoT) based botnets, you are using traffic that is generated from illegally compromised devices. These services also advertise that some vectors of attack are untraceable. If the services are for legitimate purposes, why would they advertise âtake down your competitorsâ or âattacks are untraceableâ?\nSo, are these services and projects for legitimate uses? Yes and no. It really depends on the userâs intent. As a researcher, I use different open source projects and services that could be used for malicious intent, but I use them responsibly in closed environments for research purposes only. Their availability makes it easier on me, but at the same token makes it easier for would-be criminals to attempt to run a Ransomware or DDoS-for-Ransom campaign. In my opinion when it comes down to open source projects on Github, they should only be published after responsible disclosing and patching the vulnerability. In the case of stresser services I think they need to put more effort into verifying the ownership of the intended target before the user can open fire.  \n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'booters\', \'Cyber ransom\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'malware\', \'Ransom\', \'ransom-as-a-service', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/02/for-educational-purposes-only/');

It has happened numerous times, especially with high-profile and advanced malware families, such as Zeus, Citadel, Carberp and SpyEye, which have been responsible for losses measuring in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Once dangerous tools are released to the public, they can be downloadedâand modified and enhancedâby anyone.\n\nFigure 43: âI made my money, thereâs lots of eyes looking at IOT nowâ âAnna-senpai\nAs security reporter Brian Krebs wrote, âMiscreants who develop malicious software often dump their source code publicly when law enforcement investigators and security firms start sniffing around a little too close to home.â\nThat can fuel copycatsâand âenhancedâ copycats. Radware performed a quick test to see how easy or difficult it would be for an average hacker to take the now open-sourced Mirai source code and extend its capabilities with a new, advanced attack vector.\nFigure 44: Mirai 1.0 source code showing attack vectors including UDP, DNS, SYN, GRE, HTTP\nTo do this, we considered implementing several advanced attacks that are NOT currently implemented in the original Mirai source code, such as:\n1. SSL attacks\n2. Layer-7 HTTP attacks with JavaScript support\n3. HTTP 2.0 support\nFigure 45: Radware obtains the Mirai source code from one of theGitHub repositories and builds the attack bot binary\nFrom there, we began our experiment. We were able to acquire the Mirai source code in a matter of minutes on GitHub. Compiling the bot binary and building it for the x86 platform took five minutes and did not require any programming skills. In less than an hour, we had managed to integrate another open-source attack tool called thc-ssl-dos, which can be used to launch SSL RENEGOTIATION attacks against Web servers. With some elementary coding skills, we slightly modified the code to stress servers that do not allow SSL renegotiation by rapidly establishing a new TCP connection on each SSL handshake.\n [You might also like: Letâs discuss facts: An insight into Miraiâs source-code]\nBenchmarking Our Code\nWe performed some basic benchmarking of our new attack vector capabilities against a target low-end server (Intel Xeon E3-1245V2, 16gb RAM) running Nginx 1.10 Web server (built with OpenSSL 1.0.2g). The client used to launch these attacks was sitting on a different remote server, with a latency of ~15 milliseconds roundtrip time.\nFigure 46: We can see that during âpeace time,â the server CPU usage is very low (4 cores, 8 threads)\nFigure 47: But when we launch an SSL attack using our âimprovedâ Mirai bot,our server starts to get âbusyâ handling the incoming SSL connections\nFigure 48: Running as few as two simultaneous attacks now puts our server under real stress at nearly 100% CPU on all cores\nIn our test landscape, we have observed that a single instance of our new Mirai code is capable of generating 350 SSL connections per second, which takes 50% of our server CPU resources. Multiple instances easily bring the server to full CPU utilizationâdramatically hurting system performance and availability.\nFor large enterprises with high-end backend servers, load balancers, proxies and the like, 350 SSL connections per second is negligible. However, if we extrapolate this value to 100,000 instancesâor even 1,000,000 instancesâthe resulting numbers are large enough to take down, in theory, every major website.\nOf course, we need to remember that an IoT device is running on very low power and with limited CPU/network capabilities. Even so, if we take a factor of x1,000, then an IoT botnet with 20,000 zombies will generate an attack that is 20 times higher than the one we have measured.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Botnets\nWhile much has been discussed around Mirai, IoT, âthe rise of the machinesâ and other catchy buzz-phrases, we believe one of the most disruptive changes is the new economics model of IoT botnets.\nNot so long ago, hackers were investing a great deal of money, time and effort to scan the Internet for vulnerable servers, build their army of zombie bots and then safeguard it against other hackers who might also want to claim ownership of them. All the while, hackers would keep continual watch for new infection targets that could join their zombie army.\nThings have changed: Now we see millions of vulnerable devices sitting with default credentials. Bot mastersâ the authors and owners of the botnetsâdo not even bother to secure their bots after infection. After all, as Mirai demonstrates, it does not even persist infection to disk, so a simple device reboot brings it back to a clean and healthy state.\nNevertheless, this will not prevent re-infection. As we now know, it takes less than six minutes to scan the entire IPv4 spaceâand the time-to-infection of vulnerable devices is constantly dropping. It is now estimated to take less than an hour.\nFor a bot master, gaining control of powerful servers with 1Gbit cards or 10Gbit cards was considered to be the ultimate goalâthe âHoly Grail.â Sometimes a hacker would pay hundreds of dollars every month for it. Often he or she would gain illegal access to it and work very diligently to hide it from others. And finding these serversâ then gaining access and maintaining exclusive controlâwas and still is difficult and expensive.\n [You might also like: Letâs discuss facts: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nNow with IoT botnets, we see a different picture. Instead of spending months of effort and hundreds of dollars to control a few powerful servers and several hundred infected PCs, bot masters can take control over millions of IoT devices with near zero cost.\nWhat Now?\nTo date, the number of connected devices is estimated at 6 billion, while the estimated Internet user count is just 3.5 billion (though expected to grow to 13 billion by 2020).17 This shift points to a different economyâand requires changes in thought and action.\nThe botnet attacks of 2016 also underscore the need to move beyond IoT security as an afterthought. IoT platforms and devices need to be designedâfrom the ground upâto be secure. Right now it is far too simple to victimize IoT devices; all it takes is telnet and a limited list of factory default usernames and passwords to generate botnets of unimaginable proportions. And this is only the beginning.\nReducing the potential impact of IoT botnets should be a combined effort by all IoT stakeholders:\n1. âSmart appliancesâ manufacturers need to be mindful of producing resilient products with robust\nsecurity components.\n2. To protect enterprise customers, network carriers need the ability to detect and manage traffic that originates from such devices.\n3. Enterprise customers should understand that when making a security investment to protect their\ninfrastructure and assets, they need to be able to protect not only against todayâs threats, but also against those that will arise in the next three to five years.\nThe bottom line: The effort and money weâve been expending to build defenses is no longer proportional to attackersâ investments. It is time to review the attack landscape, re-evaluate the architecture of defense mechanisms and consider how best to defend against higher-order-of-magnitude attacks.\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/02/open-source-attack-tools-open-pandoras-box/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (163, 'From the Corner Office: Views from a Chief Information Security Officer', 'Dannie Combs', '2017-2-1', 'Top Attack Trends in 2016\n1. First and foremost, we’ve seen our network—and the networks we monitor and protect—experience a tenfold increase in the volume of DDoS attacks. In August 2015, we had a little over 5,000 attacks. In July 2016, it was 55,000 attacks that we could identify. Last year, 70% to 80% of attacks were less than a minute—mostly “white noise” events (a.k.a. “hit-and-run DDoS” or “burst attacks”). This year, we’ve seen attacks falling into the one- to five-minute duration, causing random business disruptions.\n\n2. We’ve also experienced a tremendous spike in malicious use of messaging protocols being tweaked to carry out attacks—including MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), SMS (Short Message Service) and traditional email into these numbers. More than 99% of the total volume in our environment we identified as being malicious or otherwise inappropriate to deliver to the customer.\n3. The third trend is a large increase in mobile-specific ransomware activity targeting the two largest platforms: Android and Apple. We believe most of that activity is originating in a foreign country and being delivered via third-party app stores.\n\nSize, Scope and Sophistication of Attacks\nVolume. Across all categories of attacks, we’ve seen a large uptick in the total volume transfer that occurred. I’m not referring to gigs per second but the total volume. We saw our largest category of 500GB or higher have a four-fold increase. So in addition to a spike in burst attacks, we are also seeing longer-lasting attacks that are presenting more data.\nVectors. When it comes to vectors, attacks generally fall into three common protocols: NTP, DNS and CharGEN. Others may be used occasionally, but these are the three we see most commonly. Of those three, we’ll see for two or three months that DNS will be most common, and then it switches to CharGEN. There’s no clear pattern, which makes it hard to predict—just that the majority of attacks will use a common protocol and then it will change.\nSophistication. Attacks are also growing in sophistication. That holds true more so based on what we’ve seen with mobile-originating attacks. There’s been a sharp increase in malware targeting Android devices and then leveraging them for DDoS events. Many of those malware packages we’ve identified weren’t written specifically for DDoS events. It’s typically ad clicking or some other purpose, but we’ve seen some very advanced malware being leveraged for DDoS.\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nBest Practices in Managing Security\nWe have a third party that serves as our Tier 1 Security Operations Center (SOC), the traditional security analyst team that looks at everything as if through a magnifying glass. They’re the first ones expected to receive the alarm out of our event management system.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWe’re safeguarding thousands of apps—applications in our own corporate environments, applications for our enterprise customers and more than 20 million subscribers ranging from hotspots with connected Windows and Linux devices to Android and Apple devices. We lean on our vendor’s Emergency Response Team and Advanced Services group to help us validate an appropriate implementation of our security policies. These are high-value devices so we want to ensure we’re getting maximum value for those dollars, and those teams help us achieve that.\nOne of the first things I do every morning is go to our dashboards, which display alarms and DDoS trends in an executive view. Our SOC is looking at metrics on a 24×7 basis and our manager and director levels are looking at these dashboards daily. We’ve established five severity categories for attacks and each is further broken down by event or total volume transfer. Our goal is to provide the business with the complete story.\nIf an event falls into one of our two highest-severity categories (we average one highest-severity event per week and one to four second-highest-severity events per day), we have an incident management process that is initiated. First, we immediately notify various members of our security and broader carrier/technology organization. Second, we take a deep dive into the threat intelligence. Was the attack part of something broader—geopolitical, script event, collateral damage? Third, we present our findings as they pertain to any potential impact it may have caused. We provide per-incident analysis and, if needed, we have different thresholds in place on when and how to communicate. The bottom line: we’re analyzing each and every event in some manner, and thanks to how our security architecture has been built and how we manage our IP space, determine who was targeted. Generally speaking, nine out of 10 events target our customers and the rest target our corporate assets.\nOn a daily basis, I am asked the question, “Why?” I don’t have a quantified response other than a gut feeling. However, those feelings are reassured and backed by our program development and threat intelligence. We leverage a series of tools to identify that attacks are increasing. We’re now pretty confident that more and more advanced malware is being produced targeting the Android platform in particular.\nBlack Friday: From Crisis to Confidence\nWhen we first deployed a DDoS protection solution back in 2010, we actually had it on the network in a monitor-and-alert mode because at that time we didn’t see a great enough risk to justify putting those devices inline as a permanent configuration. We would have them inline as we identified specific risks. A number of times we were referenced in a campaign, so we placed those devices inline during that high-risk period and then pulled them back out. But several years ago, we made the decision to place them inline.\nOn Black Friday 2015—the busiest retail day of the year—we were the target of a large attack. I was able to send an email to our senior execs letting them know that it had occurred and we blocked it with a 100% effective rate. That was a big win for our security team.\nYou simply cannot paint a broad brush in architecture and platforms. You may protect 99 of 100 apps, but if that one app might be business critical, you still failed. Not all code development has the same level of quality or standards, and we’ve had to take that in account. Regardless of size or industry, an organization will have a reasonable, if not definitive, population of assets it’s trying to protect. Solutions must have a broad range of coverage—focusing not just on traditional network protocol protections but also offering high quality in session management and all the various techniques, like hold-down timers and HTTP protections.\nWhen I have an incident, I have a very high level of confidence that when I engage Radware’s ERT, I’m getting support from some of the world’s leading cyber security experts.\nAbove all, I tell people that if they feel they are at increased risk for DDoS attacks, they should not underestimate the level of commitment required for maintaining these platforms. Attacks and techniques change daily. You need flexible solutions and the ability to make adjustments just as frequently to protect the business. Pull those levers to keep pace with ever-changing threats to your applications and networks.\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'information security\', \'Infosec\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/02/corner-office-views-chief-information-security-officer/');

I would agree with him. As time moves forward, we are seeing more situations where no one can hide from their government as the internet closes around them. An open internet as we know it may be coming to an end as several countries begin moving towards the idea of a centralized gateway that is controlled by their government.\n\nChina has what is known as the ‘Great Firewall of China.’  The Great Firewall is controlled by the Communist Party of China (CPC), and is used to regulate the internet in mainland China. Golden Shield is the name of that project that blocks potentially unfavorable or immoral content from foreign countries. Internet users in mainland China have very limited access to a free and open internet because of this and often attempt to circumvent the firewall by using anti-censorship tools or VPNs. China has also been known to use the Firewall as a weapon.  China can use the Firewall to launch massive DDoS attacks using a technique called a Man-on-the-Side attack. This was most recently demonstrated when Github was attacked for hosting two anti-censorship projects, GreatFire and cn-nytimes. These tools were used by people in mainland China to bypass the firewall.\n\nIn December 2016, Thailand’s military-appointed parliament passed amendments to the 2007 Computer Crimes act that sparked protests and a wave of digital attacks. Under the new amendments, the government approved a plan to consolidate the 10 internet gateways in the country to a single centralized gateway controlled by the government, like we see in China today. The centralized gateway would allow the government the ability to control, intercept and arrest any person not willing to follow the Junta order. Since the amendment passed, Anonymous has launched OpSingleGatway, an operation designed to bring attention to the Single Gateway project through a series of digital attacks.\n [You might also like: See Through the DDoS Smoke-Screen to Protect Sensitive Data]\nOn January  26th 2017 during a lecture at the Military Academy of General Staff, advisor to the President on the Internet, Germna Klimenko, expressed a personal opinion during the event that the only opportunity to ensure Russia’s data from digital threats would be to place restrictions and limit internet access in Russia, similar to what China has done with the Great Firewall and what Thailand is planning on doing.  Klimenko believes that Russia should follow in China’s footsteps in evaluating their digital threat and restricting access so the risk is no longer presented. He also went on to say that foreign tech companies working in the country should be forced to cooperate with law enforcement or risk being banned from doing business in Russia.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nIn September 2016, the U.K.’s intelligence agency GCHQ announced its intentions to launch a national firewall to “protect against malicious websites and emails.” They plan to work with major British carriers to scan and filter sites deemed malicious or suspicious.  The GCHQ wants to create a national domain name system(DNS) to block flagged traffic. This announcement was met with overall skepticism and serious concerns from privacy groups that fear the agency will use it as a means of boosting its surveillance powers.\n \nAs Donald Trump settles into office he has tapped Ajit Pai, an opponent of consumer protection rules, to become Chairman of the FCC. Pai, an opponent of net neutrality, and his officials will soon oversee the FCC, an agency responsible for assuring an open internet in the United States. The idea of an open internet is that your Internet Service Providers (ISP), will treat all traffic equally and will not censor your content. This also means you will not have to pay for a fast lane to access content from specific companies. Once seated, the United States could quickly begin to see a breakdown of consumer protection related to an open internet within the year.\nSo, what does a closed internet look like in the United States? A pay to play fast lane, or could we actually see our own great firewall built in the future? From a national security perspective, I understand the reason behind wanting to have a closed and centralized internet, but as a human that has always had free and uncensored access to the internet, even asking me to pay more for the content I already have access to is a bit extreme. Couple that with censoring the internet due to a government official deeming the content is unfavorable, and we have ourselves a problem here. So, what do we do to prevent a closing internet? To be honest, I don’t know if we can prevent it but I know I will stand up to make sure I can always maintain my digital freedoms.  If you want to learn more about how to defend your rights in a digital world visit, Eff.org to learn about how they work to defend your civil liberties.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Closed Internet\', \'Internet Freedoms\', \'Open Internet\', \'privacy\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/internet-censorship-open-internet/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (165, 'See Through the DDoS Smoke-Screen to Protect Sensitive Data', 'Paul Mazzucco', '2017-1-26', 'DDoS attacks can be costly and risky. TierPoint is witnessing a growing trend of using such attacks as the means to another, potentially more devastating, end: stealing sensitive data. Call this new breed of attack the “DDDoS”—deceptive distributed denial-of-service. For two recent examples, look to attacks on Carphone Warehouse and Linode. By bombarding Carphone Warehouse with online traffic, hackers were able to steal the personal and banking details of 2.4 million people. Similarly, cloud provider Linode suffered more than 30 DDoS attacks which appeared to be a ruse to divert attention away from a breach of user accounts.\n\nWith these “DDDoS” attacks, cyber-criminals distract business and IT resources to pursue larger objectives. The most recent Radware security industry survey shows that a growing number of security leaders are aware of escalating threats.\n\nThese are true concerns. DDoS as a smokescreen isn’t new. Yet, as with so many cyber-security trends, its rise can be traced to financial motives. The value of stolen data in the dark market intrigues potential cyber-delinquents to find ways to get access to it. The darknet offers a marketplace for capturing that value. Consider the following based on research by McAfee:\n\nAverage estimated price for stolen credit and debit cards: $5 to $30 in the United States, $20 to $35 in the United Kingdom, $20 to $40 in Canada, $21 to $40 in Australia and $25 to $45 in the European Union\nBank login credentials for a bank account with a $2,200 balance: $190\nPatient Health Information (PHI): $500 to $1,800 depending on patient age and insurance coverage\nLogin credentials for online payment services, such as PayPal: $20 to $50 for account balances from $400 to $1,000; $200 to $300 for balances from $5,000 to $8,000\n\nWhy Attacks Succeed\nLack of preparedness for DDoS detection and DDoS mitigation is a boon to cyber-criminals. Indeed, about two-thirds of businesses are still mitigating attacks with tools not designed for DDoS. Web application firewalls switches, routers and traditional firewall ISP-based protection are unlikely to save a business from a DDoS attack. In fact, firewalls often create bottlenecks and accelerate outages. Unfortunately, due to inappropriate DDoS mitigations in place, organizations expose themselves not only to DDoS but also to other data-theft oriented attacks that arrive in conjunction with the DDoS attack. The unintended consequence? Companies not only suffer data leakage & reputation loss, their human and technological resources of rectifying the situation is at least doubled.\n [You might also like: How Lucrative is Confidential Data? Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses]\nTierPoint observations and experience point to these as the most common vectors for DDoS smokescreen attacks:\n\nEncrypted/non-volumetric attacks. This includes protocol attacks, such as SYN floods, fragmented packet attacks and Pings of Death. These types of attacks consume actual server and/or firewall resources. Such resource starvation attacks use service calls to the IP stack, such as TCP-SYN requests and calls to the underlying authentication or operating system, to tie up and eventually overwhelm system memory and computing processes.\n\n\nApplication-layer attacks. These include Slowloris and zero-day DDoS attacks, as well as DDoS attacks targeting Apache, Windows or openBSD vulnerabilities. Built around seemingly legitimate and innocuous requests, these attacks aim to crash the web server. Their magnitude is measured in requests per second.\n\n\nVolumetric attacks. These include User Datagram Protocols (UDP) floods, ICMP flood and other spoofed-packet floods. The goal: to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site. Magnitude is measured in bits per second.\n\nMounting a Defense\nGiven their reach and impact, DDoS attacks are no longer an issue for just the security team or IT department. Such attacks—particularly when used as a smokescreen for more nefarious tactics—are now an executive and board-level concern:\nFigure X: Radware 2016 Security and the C-Suite: Threats and Opportunities, Radware, 2016\nTierPoint is witnessing a growing percentage of organizations turning to hybrid IT solutions to address security risks and concerns. This approach incorporates a mix of cloud and managed security services with products and services employed at a business’ own data center.\nAn example is an organization combining a mitigation appliance and a DDoS mitigation service. While the appliance blocks attacks at the application layer, a cloud-based service scrubs higher volumes of malicious traffic. In the financial service industry, 45% of institutions have already adopted this approach.\nAs the stakes get higher—and the “smoke” grows thicker—TierPoint advises organizations to solidify a strategic DDoS detection and mitigation plan before an attack takes place. This includes understanding your risk profile and tolerance as well as determining the right balance of managed security services and security solutions administered internally.\n\n\nRead the 2016–2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radware’s Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"See Through the DDoS Smoke-Screen to Protect Sensitive Data\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/see-ddos-smoke-screen-protect-sensitive-data/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Paul Mazzucco\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ddos-as-a-smokescreen.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1280,\n        \"width\": 1920 \n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-01-26\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-01-26\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155 \n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/see-ddos-smoke-screen-protect-sensitive-data/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (166, '5 Recommendations for IoT Manufacturers', 'Pascal Geenens', '2017-1-25', 'As devices get more connected, they potentially get smarter and provide richer functionality. The internet of things (IoT) describes a world where just about anything can be connected, from routers, smart thermostats, smart light bulbs, and door locks to intelligent fridges, or even cars.\nIn recent events, devices with less than desirable security states were taken over by massive botnets consisting of hundreds of thousands of devices that were able to launch an impressive DDoS attack that crippled several online services.\n\nSecurity should be a top priority in the strategy of manufacturers and not an afterthought. Consumers are in need of solutions built with security in mind and which protect their homes, their lives and their private information. There is a need for better regulations due to a lack of product certifications or labels to help consumers in differentiating brands and products with respect to their security state.\n\nFor this reason, I would like to propose five best practices that any IoT manufacturer should consider:\n1) Invest in a common operating platform built with security in mind.\nIt is worth thinking about this and making the right choices upfront as to make sure all your future devices support the operating environment. A single OS provides a consistent user experience across your devices and you will profit from scaling updates, changes, and improvements on all your devices, limiting the duplication and porting efforts of security updates and new features. Linux and BusyBox, although in the eye of the storm of all things bad surrounding IoT, can be a good choice for embedded devices, as is Windows 10, Android, or any other fitting platform. It isn’t the base OS as such that will provide the security, but it is how you go about it and how you harden the platform and maintain its most up to date version. Some pointers:\n\nUnnecessary services should be disabled by default, especially SSH, Telnet, SMB, FTP: Un-savvy users will never use these services and the ones that actually might need them for advanced operations will be able to find and understand the ‘enable SSH’ flag in the ‘advanced options’ tab. Do not worry, even if you bury the option in the most illogical place, the people who want it will find it.\n\n\nDo not run your management GUI from a web server that runs in root context – if you have an RCE vulnerability, you are pretty much completely exposed. Run the web server in chroot environment and with a user that has limited rights. Most modern web servers by default are configured for running with limited rights, however we have seen manufacturers changing this to have the web server run as root because it was more convenient for them to read/write protected files. There are better ways of doing this, it might take a bit more effort to get this designed into your software but it is well worth the effort. Do consider the fact that whatever shortcut you take to make your life easier, you are also making the life of the potential hacker easier! Whatever you can read/write from your software, a hacker can potentially do so as well. This will add an important layer of security and severely limit the impact of inadvertent programming mistakes – no software is perfect and completely free of vulnerabilities, keep this in mind!\n\n\nUse up-to-date versions of OS kernel and services such as Telnetd/SSHD, web server, php or any other GUI supporting framework. Even the most securely-written software will be vulnerable when it runs on a vulnerable framework or service.\n\n\nDo not keep hidden backdoors or try to stash secret passcodes – some manufacturers have been found keeping backdoors for remote tech support. It is just a matter of time before your secret is exposed and abused. Do know that just by unpacking and inspecting publicly downloadable microcode updates, most of the backdoors and secret passes can easily be discovered – a hacker does not even need access to a device to uncover such information.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n\nUPNP on the local network for discovery is fine and will enhance the user experience, but avoid the use of UPNP-IGD (Internet Gateway Device protocol). The UPNP-IGD protocol allows you to punch holes in the security policy of the owners’ internet gateways, most of the time without them being aware of that, to make your device directly reachable from the internet. If you must have internet reachability, be aware of the consequences you are exposing your device to and whatever measure has been taken to secure it should at least be doubled – you are now open and exposed. Also, let the user open a port or create a port forwarding rule by himself, at least they are aware of the security risk and hole in their internet gateway. Better would be however to try to find other ways to avoid the need for internet exposure. It is of course possible that in the end, opening a port is the only way, in that case assume the responsibility!\n\n [You might also like: Nine Questions to Ask to Determine IoT Device Safety]\n2) Enforce strong passwords but do not require them to be extremely difficult to prevent users from having to write down their passwords. \nThose who want to use extreme passwords can do so and some might do it through password management tools, so allow them but do not enforce them. Use common password checks based on publicly available password dictionaries to prevent users from exposing themselves to brute-force attacks.\nDo not store the passwords in reversible format using symmetric encryption, use cryptographic hash to store passwords. Choose modern, secure hashing methods and avoid MD5 or SHA-1. Even the most secure password is useless if you are using weak hashing.\nAlternatively, you could work around the whole password issue by integrating with the most common enterprise centralized authentication services such as LDAP, Radius or TACACS and leverage the enterprises’ established password policies.\n3) Invest time in a robust and user-friendly OTA (over-the-air) update procedure. \nIdeally updates should be seamless and automatic. Alternatively, give the user the ability to download and update his/her device through a simple click on a button in the admin GUI. Do not require users to download a package, burn it to a flash card and have them press impossible key-sequences or CLI commands to start the update procedure of the device. Make it convenient and accessible.\nProvide notifications to owners, e.g. by email, when there is a new update available so they can take timely and appropriate action.\nSign your update packages and verify them at install time to ensure they are not tampered with by bad actors.\n4) Create a vulnerability disclosure and handling program and provide clear instructions and points of contact for security researchers. \nConsider a bounty program to attract security researchers. Take every reported vulnerability seriously and follow up closely with the researcher. Give the researcher credit and let them publish their findings after you fixed the vulnerability. No device or software is free of vulnerabilities, everyone can appreciate that, so there is no bad publicity in the fact that a researcher publishes a vulnerability that you already addressed and you have an update for – it will only build you a stronger reputation and security researchers and consumers will see you as a serious, trusted manufacturer.\n5) Try to limit the personal data that needs to be stored on the devices themselves – the more information gets stored, the more can be stolen. \nSame for the cloud service that might be related to your devices. Remember that starting May 2018, any provider storing personal information from a EU citizen will be held responsible for protecting that data as part of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and can face fines of up to 20,000,000 euro for not adhering to the regulation. If you need profile information, store them encrypted and clearly inform the user of the risk.\nOne more piece of advice before concluding: Ask for help!\nThe security challenge is enormous because there is currently no standard and, worse, no consensus on how to implement security when it comes to IoT on devices. But like all providers, you have to assume responsibility. Don’t wait for regulations to start considering the security of your products.

One of the advertisements that struck me as typical was an advertisement for a DDoS botnet for rent. It wasn’t that there was a botnet for rent, as those are everywhere. It was the Listing Details that put together a value proposition for attacking somebody that caught my eye. It says:\n“Another advantage of the DDOS attack that you probably don’t know is the loss of Google Organic Ranking. Google really don’t like unreachable URLs or slow website. As soon as they find a decrease of availability or speed, your target will be temporary removed from results and then it will lose his Google ranking. Two weeks after a four days DDOS attack, I have seen a website going from first page to third page.”\n\n\nMost online commerce sites spend a tremendous amount of money getting to the first page in search. Organic Search results are the result of SEO efforts and quality of their website. Search Engine Optimization is done through a variety of website structure best practices and offsite traffic-building techniques. These techniques are both visible (content tweaks and changes) and non-visible (website code changes such as the meta description) to the visitor. AdWords are paid advertisements to be on the first page of search. Both have costs associated with them and most companies do a blend of both in their marketing budget.\nA number of years ago, I worked with a company in the U.S. who had issues with competitors “scraping” their site for prices. This was the typical data harvesting operation to change prices and compete with their online marketing campaigns to gain the upper hand. When we helped them to identify and remove these competitors from their site, the traffic to their site immediately was reduced by 66% and their page speed and load times reduced by 50%, effectively doubling their page speed. As a result of this, their organic search ranking increased within a couple of months, and they enjoyed the benefits. A year later, we asked them about their online business, and it had grown exponentially and was competing with their physical stores for sales.\n [You might also like: 5 ways hackers market their products and services]\nNow, what if somebody decides to use this knowledge to run DDoS attacks against their competitors? Can it lower their organic search rankings if the site is slow and or offline? Google has been putting more focus on page speed and page load times especially with mobile devices. If your pages aren’t loading quickly, then that can negatively impact rankings because the site overall has a poor user experience. User experience has become very important for engagement, and search engines are always working to keep their existing users.\nOne of the things we know already as of today is that bots and scrapers account for over 50% of page visitors to most web sites. This already puts a burden on servers and page load times. If your organization were paying over $100,000 a year in SEO and web-based marketing (or more), would you respond to a ransom letter threatening to DDoS your website for two weeks if you didn’t pay the ransom? What would it cost you if you went from first page in search to the third or fourth page? What would the impact be to your marketing efforts and SEO efforts if a single DDoS attack could take you backwards 2-3 years?\nWith ransom attacks becoming the leader in the motivation behind DDoS attacks, the criminals are seeing the increase in profits today:\n\nCompetition accounts for 26% of these attacks. It could be said that over 50% of the time, attackers are either competitors or somebody who would profit from your losses. You could ask companies who have been attacked, “what was the end result of the attack?” “Did it slow down the site?” “Did it cause a longer term latency to the page?” “Did it cause legitimate users to go away and cause lack of sales?”\nWith this advertisement on the DarkNet showing the value proposition of renting the botnet, is this something we will begin to see more of in 2017? Our prediction is that marketing departments are going to start seeing ransom letters proposing this loss, and not just the IT departments anymore.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Can your SEO rankings be lowered by a DDoS Attack?\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/can-seo-rankings-be-lowered-by-ddos-attack/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"David Hobbs \",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/seo-ddos-attack.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1427,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-01-27\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-01-27\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'DDoS attack\', \'search\', \'SEO\', \'web page\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/can-seo-rankings-be-lowered-by-ddos-attack/');

Personal data is considered our economical asset generated by our identities and our behavior and we trade it for higher quality services and products. Online platforms act as intermediaries in a two-sided market collecting data from consumers and selling advertising slots to companies. In exchange for our data being collected, we get what appears to be a free service.\nThe growth and the market capitalization of social platform providers like Facebook and search engines such as Google demonstrate the value of personal data. Personal data also provides new ways to monetize services as news organizations are finding it difficult to charge ‘real’ money for digital news, but leverage our willingness to pay for a selection of ‘free’ news with our personal data. Every 3 out of 4 persons prefer free registration with selective access over a paid registration with full access.\n\nWhere there are valuables, there is crime.\nSharing information on our whereabouts on Facebook, posting a picture with our current GPS coordinates in the meta data on Instagram, using Foursquare to find a good place to eat and drink. Got a fancy new car, post a picture on Facebook. Did you blur the number plate on your car’s picture? Cozy family photo in the restaurant, credit card on the table… these are just a few examples of social information and personal leaks thieves can leverage.\n\nCybercrime is trending up and the crime economics of personal data, whether sold off or used for extortion, is paying off big time. Breaching and leaking personal records can be leveraged as a strategy for depreciating the value of an organization (the Yahoo! hack) or destroying its customer trust. In 2016 alone, over 2.2 billion records were reported stolen in almost 3,000 data breaches. And it’s not over as we started of the new year with 1.5 million user records being leaked after the Esports Entertainment Association (ESEA) refused to pay a $100,000 ransom.\n [You might also like: Is the Internet Rolling Back Our Freedoms?]\nThe General Data Protection Regulation\nIn January 2012, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the data protection rules in the EU. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the largest reform in data protection law in the past 20 years. The objective of the new set of rules is to give back control to EU citizens over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for business through making it consistent across EU member states. The regulation provides protection concerning the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data and will apply from 25 May 2018.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nCreating business opportunities\nConsumer research in the last several years shows a decline in trust and an increase in levels of concern about the protection and processing of their personal data, and this is believed to have an influence on the future growth of digital technologies. For the EU citizen, the GDPR means a reinforcement of their individual rights, while businesses restore the trust of their consumers. The GDPR is creating business opportunities for established organizations, small and large, EU Members and foreign organizations, and levels the playing field for EU cloud companies to compete with established hyper-scale, world-wide cloud service providers within the EU market. This new regulation will provide a one-stop-shop for companies doing business in the EU, having them deal with a single supervisory authority. A single law to abide by will save money and ignite businesses across and within the EU.\nEnforcement actions\nThe flip side of the GDPR is a whole new set of regulatory rules and measures to comply with and implement by any organization that controls or processes any form of personal data. Personal data is to interpreted in the wide sense of the term and pertains to any information relating to an individual, whether it relates to his or her private, professional or public life and can be anything from a name, a picture, an email address, financial details, posts on social networks, or even a computer’s IP address. Not abiding to the GDPR will be met with enforced action including fines of up to € 20,000,000 or 4% of your annual worldwide revenue when facing a breach of the data protection rules. The GDPR includes provisions that promote accountability and governance that can be audited with non-compliance, leading to administrative fines of up to € 10,000,000 or 2% of annual worldwide revenue.\nGlobal Scope\nWhenever a company wants to trade or do business with one or several of the EU Member States, it will have to prove adequacy – in other words, its data protection standards would have to be equivalent to the EU’s GDPR starting in May 2018. This virtually makes GDPR a global, worldwide regulation affecting organizations and businesses around the globe.\n [You might also like: Your Right to Privacy]\nWhat does it mean to online businesses and cloud service providers?\nFor online businesses and cloud service providers, GDPR compliance means adherence to the principles of “Privacy by Design” and “Data Protection by Design” during the design, development, implementation and deployment of web applications or services, and any components or services associated with them. With the rapid adoption of cloud security services there is a heightened concern with regard to the readiness of these applications and services. A recent study conducted by Symantec/Bluecoat shows that 98% of today’s cloud applications do not even come close to being GDPR-ready.\nWAF/DDoS and the GDPR\nBased on recital 39 of the GDPR, personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality, including preventing unauthorized access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. Recital 49 goes further by requiring the ability of a network or an information system to resist accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems. The recital literally says “This could, for example, include preventing unauthorized access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping ‘denial of service’ attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems.”\nMost businesses will face the urgent need for increasing protection on published applications and services on all topics and purposes of Data Leak Prevention, Access Control, Web-based Attack Prevention and Denial-of-Service prevention. Leading providers of cloud and on-premise Web Application and API Protection services as well as on-demand, always-on cloud and hybrid Denial-of-Service mitigation services do provide an adequate solution for this acute need. A fully managed web application firewall (WAF) and Cloud DDoS service provides a fast route to check off one of the regulatory compliance boxes and a worry-free GDPR compliance strategy.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"WAF and DDoS Help You on the Road to GDPR Compliancy\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/waf-ddos-gdpr-compliancy/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Pascal Geenens\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gdpr-compliance.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1078,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2017-01-19\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2017-01-19\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Compliance\', \'GDPR\', \'personal data\', \'privacy\', \'regulations\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/waf-ddos-gdpr-compliancy/');

The benefits of this are clearâ¦fast and wide malware distribution touching thousands of devices.\nEnter stage left, Popcorn Time…the first ransomware, which uses the human victim themselves to find and target additional victims to continue distribution of the malware. The idea is straightforward. When your computer becomes infected, you have fourÂ options: 1) Pay the ransom and gain back control of your data, 2) Identify personal contacts you will try to infect in order to have your data released, essentially blackmailing the victim, 3) Call law enforcement for help and hope they have the resources to help, or 4) Do nothing. Looking at these, there are really only two options that will help the victim: Pay out, or provide targets.\n\nThis is a game changer as it forces human intervention and moral dilemma to develop calculated targets of contacts they know to be easy victims.\n\nSocial Implications\nThe Social Engineering aspect of this malware is relatively simple: Humans are self-serving and will only look out for themselves. Either you are a âGood Personâ and you find a resolution internally (or with law enforcement), or you are an âEvil Personâ and send this out to a small list of contacts and further propagate the ransomware. There is no middle ground.\nThat said, this decision isnât simply weighted with the original victimâs moral conscious. It has to do with the development and technology laws within the victimâs country, the resources of the business being attacked, and the bandwidth of law enforcement to help, mitigate, and trace the malware to the source.\n [You might also like: Social Engineering]\nLegal Implications\nAs I mentioned above, traditional ransomware is self-distributing, and in many cases, has an electronic data trail leading law enforcement back to a Command and Control computer. What if that data trail runs back to a friend or business contact that knowingly targeted you to save their company? Are you at fault for opening a seemingly malicious email? Are they at fault for taking the bait and putting you on that list? Are you at fault for not having advanced malware filters in your environment? If law enforcement doesnât help you, can you help yourself?\nSecurity professionals need to be right 100% of the time…hackers need to get lucky once. The more hackers can increase their odds of network penetration through human interaction, the more effective they will be.\nWill this strategy even work?\nThese are all questions that will be asked over the coming year. Until we start seeing this propagating, there is no telling what human-directed malware will do.\nPart of the effectiveness of these strategies has to do with the deployment of encryption when hijacking and ransoming corporate data. Looking back, encryption has been seen as the âWhite Knightâ protecting sensitive corporate information. Now, those tables have turned. Sun-Tzu stated in the Art of War, âTo know your Enemy, you must become your Enemy.â In the case of most ransomware, hackers have used our own encryption techniques against us.\nThe only thing that is for certain, this is one Popcorn Time you wonât want to share with friends.\n\n\nRead the 2016â2017 Global Application & Network Security Report by Radwareâs Emergency Response Team.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Ransomware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/popcorn-time-malware/');

TheShadowBrokers is going dark, making exit. Continuing is being much risk and b*******, not many bitcoins. … Despite theories, it always being about bitcoins for TheShadowBrokers. Free dumps and b******* political talk was being for marketing attention. There being no bitcoins in free dumps and giveaways. You are being disappointed? Nobody is being more disappointed than TheShadowBrokers.”\n\n\nThe message continues, “But TheShadowBrokers is leaving door open. You having TheShadowBrokers public bitcoin address ….. TheShadowBrokers offer is still being good, no expiration. If TheShadowBrokers receiving 10,000 btc in bitcoin address then coming out of hiding and dumping password for Linux + Windows.”\nThe Shadow Brokers offered up for bid a batch of exploits and hacking tools supposedly stolen from and used by the NSA on August 15th of 2016. A sample of the tools and exploits was openly posted while an encrypted dump supposedly contained the full set of tools and exploits. As of October 1st 2016 there were only bids totaling little over 1.7 BTC ($1,082 at the time), not even close to their asking price of 1 million BTC ($500 million at the time).\nThe Shadow Brokers abandoned their efforts to auction and started a crowdfunding campaign to raise 10,000 BTC ($6.38 million) with the promise to publish the password to decrypt the full dump once the sum raised. Although the crowdfunding seemed more reasonable, they gathered little over 2 BTC.\n [You might also like: 5 ways hackers market their products and services]\nOn December 14th The Shadow Brokers put up the tools, exploits and implants for direct sale on ZeroNet. ZeroNet is a platform for hosting websites using blockchain and BitTorrent technology. Individual tools were on offer for prices ranging from 1 to 100 BTC as well as the whole archive for 1,000 BTC ($780,000 at the time).\nEventually, on January 12th, after nearly five months of campaigning and price drops from 1 million to as low as 1,000 BTC, The Shadow Brokers threw in the towel and announced their retirement from the dark scene… albeit not without leaving the (back)door open.\n\nWhat conclusions can be drawn from this small piece of cyber-crime history?\n\n The economics of the dark markets is mainly based on un-exclusive, common, and inexpensive tools for opportunistic cyber criminals\n\nThe failed attempts at selling premium grade cyber warfare tools for excessive prices shows that there is no place for it on the ‘open’ black market. The economics of the dark markets is mainly based on un-exclusive, common, and inexpensive tools for the lower-profile cyber criminals that are looking for low-hanging fruit and are looking to make a quick buck. The more sophisticated, higher-profile hackers prefer to roll their own toolset and thrive on their own research to produce exclusive and untraceable exploits. In contrast with their opportunistic counterparts, they are patient, to the point they can stay covert for years, running hidden tools and maintaining inactive zombies, timing their actions well before making their ‘coup de grace’. The ‘Methbot’ ad fraud campaign that allegedly set back online advertisers up to $5 million a day adequately serves as an example.\n\n State actors are not interested in secondhand exploits and implants\n\nAnother conclusion, in my opinion, is that state actors are not interested in a handed down kit. We do know that they are prepared to pay top dollar for exclusive access to zero days and undisclosed exploits or implants, but not for tools that others also might have access to. It would be naïve of them to think that the NSA would not have secured, or has honeypots deployed, to protect itself and track down any attempts based on their own exposed tools by now.\n\n The Shadow Brokers might be operated by the NSA\n\nWho says the NSA was not implicated in a larger plot? Maybe they are or they impersonated The Shadow Brokers, willfully exposing their old and deprecated tools for enemy state actors to get their hands on it. Once used against them by the enemy, the enemy would be identified, and exposed to counter attacks. Potentially, as some tools in the pricelist were categorized as ‘unknown’, the toolset could include a Trojan horse, unique fingerprints or some clever trackers which would allow the NSA to identify, track, correlate and increase intelligence on their enemy state actors.\nWhat are the implications on the threat and cyber war landscapes?\n\n Expect a sudden and short rise in opportunistic campaigns based on the freebies left by The Shadow Brokers\n\nBased on the first conclusion, it is not improbable that the freebie tools left as samples by The Shadow Brokers on their ZeroNet site will be picked up by opportunistic cyber criminals in campaigns to extort victims, gaining them access to easy money. More than half of the tools are already known and detected by most anti-malwares, and it is only a matter of time before security analysts have closed the gap and provide protection against the full threat archive. If there is something to expect from this, it might be a sudden and short rise in opportunistic campaigns. Enterprises should expect this and preferably already start to take measures to prevent them: update all systems, update IDP signatures and contact vendors for quick mitigation or measures specific to this threat package.\n\n The NSA lost its offensive arsenal and are left weakened and exposed to enemy state actors in the cyber war\n\nIf the NSA was not planning on this, they will have suffered a serious blow as their tools have been exposed now and they cannot be sure that they were not sold below the radar or given to or stolen from The Shadow Broker by enemy state actors. Consequently, they pretty much lost their offensive cyber arsenal and it will take them months, if not years, to get back to the same level of threat and offense. Without a good offense, they are weakened and exposed to enemy state actors that might embrace this opportunity to launch campaigns against the U.S.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Darknet\', \'malware\', \'Shadow Brokers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/shadow-brokers-went-dark/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (171, 'The DDoS Threat for Enterprises: Why Managed Security Matters', 'Hawley Hansen', '2017-1-12', 'As evidenced by the massive DDoS (distributed denial of service attack) in October that affected Netflix, Twitter and others, even large Internet-based companies are vulnerable to cyber-crime on a large scale. The Mirai botnet, whose source code is now available online, is credited with powering what’s been called the largest volumetric DDoS attack of its kind in history.\nMirai is the open-source DDoS toolkit that spread self-propagating malware responsible for overwhelming large servers across at least two continents. The malware simply exploited known vulnerabilities in the aging DNS (domain name server) technology that underpins the Internet’s equivalent of a phone book.\n\n\nMore Botnet Attacks Probable\nMany prominent voices in the cybersecurity arena warn that DDoS attacks, already on the rise, are likely to proliferate as botnets spread. After the source code for Mirai was released earlier this fall, other attackers modified and began deploying it for themselves. Moreover, numerous botnets are available for rent on the Darknet.\nIn addition, easy access to such DDoS “recipes” virtually assures new exploits sprouting across the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, seeded as it is with marginally-secured gadgets meant to simplify life. Ironically, many of the most vulnerable devices, such as Internet cameras, are marketed to make our homes and offices safer.\nUnfortunately, enterprises are top targets for DDoS attackers. At the same time, enterprise IT is increasingly budget-strapped, working at capacity maintaining basic operations.\nPerhaps more concerning, according to Frost & Sullivan’s Michael Suby, “What is certain in cyber-attacks is uncertainty; the element of surprise serves attackers well.”\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation: Which is Right for Your Organization?]\nSo, what are today’s businesses, particularly those in the middle of the market, budget- and staff-wise, to do?\nToo Much Risk, Too Many IT Limitations\nMidmarket businesses, chiefly those with multiple locations, need alternatives to better protect themselves from the increasing number, type and sophistication of cyber-attacks. To complicate matters, businesses also are dealing with software “patch fatigue.”\nEnterprises often are unable to keep up with the sheer volume of software patches required to secure their networks, digital assets and IT infrastructure against cyber-criminals. Hackers know this, and are relentless in fielding DDoS and other exploits that prey on vulnerabilities too frequently opened by unpatched, poorly configured or outdated software.\nFor this reason, my colleagues and I are seeing more businesses opting to outsource managed security. Many of our customers are finding they can meet compliance requirements without impacting IT operations, all while saving money, through managed security services (MSS). A few commonly occurring challenges, and their MSS counters, illustrate how and why North American businesses are more readily embracing outsourced cyber security.\nChallenge 1: Lack of technical know-how, qualified staffing and infrastructure to avert or remediate security breaches.\nSolution: MSS can prevent unauthorized access to network infrastructure. The provider will ensure secure use of the customer’s IP-VPN. The benefits include:\n> High-quality DDoS protection and DDoS mitigation against existing and new threats.\n> Assured compliance with regulatory requirements for network security.\nChallenge 2: Threat of high revenue loss and competitive position associated with data breaches.\nSolution: Corporate websites are cyber-hardened through MSS against DDoS and other intrusions. Attacks that do occur are mitigated, returning operations to normal in minutes. The benefits include:\n> One point of contact to prevent or immediately address the gamut of increasingly complex threats.\n> Round-the-clock expertise dedicated to monitoring and managing the enterprise’s cyber security.\nChallenge 3: Rising costs for security management and technology.\nSolution: Outsourced security services reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) while safeguarding networks. In-house IT personnel can be more productive focusing on core operations. The benefits include:\n> Avoiding additional hires to ensure proper network protection.\n> Reducing downtime, productivity impediments and revenue loss due to a security breach that compromises data.\nFinding the Right MSS Fit\nIn light of the challenges summarized above, some managers resist MSS solutions for two primary reasons. First, they are concerned about relinquishing control over network processes. Second, they are skeptical about cost-benefit claims. MSS providers, including XO Communications, are well equipped to address these concerns, point for point, to offer a level of return that can exceed norms typically seen in network services.\nCosts for managed security services vary enormously depending on factors that include type of DDoS services required, geographic scope and number of locations, and technical complexity of the systems involved. Given the wide range of variables MSS can entail, industry analysts often focus on total cost of ownership (TCO) to help businesses weigh costs against services provided. Enterprise due diligence that includes analyst evaluations is more likely to capture a fuller picture of a provider’s merits. To illustrate, Frost & Sullivan’s Michael Suby evaluated XO Communications recently, concluding:\n“The cost of mitigating volumetric DDoS attacks doesn’t have to be another painful layer of uncertainty.

Today, for various reasons, we are seeing it become mainstream.\nRansom attacks on companies are becoming big business. Many businesses say they will not pay, but when attacked, find that they do.  But how do they pay?  Bitcoin. Just like having insurance policies, companies are now investing in keeping Bitcoin around for business continuity against DDoS attacks as well as Malware CryptoLocker and Data Extortion attacks.\n\n\n\nRansom and extortion campaigns have proven to bring in big profits for the cyber attackers who have targeted the U.S. and the U.K. Here in Asia, I often run into the common misconception that an ISP is responsible for defending the customers. I’ve met with various companies that have yet to be attacked that have high value assets. My prediction for 2017 is that Asia Pacific will become ripe for cyber attackers to make a large amount of extortion money here.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nOutside of cyber-attacks, there is still the criminal trading underground. We’ve seen the rise and fall and resurrection of online marketplaces for illegal drugs, like the Silk Road. As government agencies shut them down, two more pop up. It’s a giant game of whack-a-mole, and as this happens and the press continues to cover the arrests and presence of these marketplaces, more visibility is given to the existence of them. Teenagers are now finding a safer way to purchase drugs online by visiting the Darknet. As some governments in the Asia Pacific region have started executing drug dealers, a much safer anonymous marketplace exists. Bitcoin is the currency for anyone wishing to be involved in the online drug trade.\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nOn the topic of safety, many see Bitcoin as the new gold. Market uncertainty often pushes people to move toward a safe haven. Bitcoin is being seen as a digital safe haven. Here in India, I’ve had the pleasure of standing in 3-hour long bank lines to use an ATM for a maximum withdrawal of ₹2,000 rupees per day (about $30 USD). After going across town to 2-3 different banks to find one that still actually HAD money in the ATM to dispense, I can see how the appeal of moving to another currency is very attractive. The Indian government made the demonetization move to stamp out black money and corruption. Bitcoin is simply the easier way for people to move their money (once they convert the cash, which has been the tricky part in India) globally.\nWe’ve seen a rise in Bitcoin usage in various countries, including China due to government restrictions. Foreign investment caps have been placed in China. The government has sought to keep currency and prevent “capital flight” from the country. Some say that a large percentage of the trade in Bitcoin is happening in Asian exchanges. According to research firm Rhodium Group, $762 billion exited China in the first 11 months of 2016. Rumors of China attempting to restrict Bitcoin caused a sudden sell-off last week. Speculation is that the fall of the Yuan has brought a sudden rise to Bitcoin.\n\nWith all of the factors listed above, this makes sense to me why the sudden surge and drop in Bitcoin. Targets are ripe and prime for extortion due to lack of security. Companies must buy bitcoins as insurance in case they aren’t completely battle-hardened and tested. Governments like India and Venezuela that are having demonetization issues are also causing part of the surge in Bitcoin usage. Today, Bitcoin is within a few dollars of its all-time high. Will we see Bitcoin at $2,000 per BTC in 2017? I predict that China will have to adopt Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to keep the population happy. I also predict that India will possibly become another large user in Bitcoin.\n\n\nDownload the “Cyber Ransom Survival Guide: The Growing Threat of Ransomware and RDoS – and What to Do About It” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber ransom\', \'Ransom\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2017/01/current-surge-bitcoin-prices/');

Prime Bounty for Hackers, Top Concern for Businesses', 'Ben Zilberman', '2017-1-10', 'IT Professionals report securing sensitive data as the #1 challenge, even more than avoiding revenue loss or protecting reputation\nIn the 19th century, money was the key to power. During the 20th century, it was technology. Today, information and data is the key to power. It’s why organizations are keen to safeguard their data and hackers are intent on stealing it. In 2016, this fact was underscored numerous times: Wikileaks, ransom attacks that hijacked an organization’s digital assets, or the doxing and dumping of information about officials and decision makers.\n\nToday, servers, and the data they contain, are the primary target of cyber-attacks, versus internet pipe saturation or firewall exhaustion as in years past. Furthermore, after cyber-ransom was a concern for individuals, in 2016 it has become the primary motivation for cyber-attacks (41%) against businesses. They trade volumes of data such as personal identification, account credentials and medical records– and now enterprise and government confidential data – are rapidly growing throughout the Darknet marketplaces. The bottom line: data is the new gold bullion.\n\nRadware’s annual Global Application & Network Security Report combines a comprehensive information-security industry survey with our Emergency Response Team’s (ERT) in-the-trenches experiences fighting cyber-attacks, and incorporate perspectives of third-party service providers and customer stories. \nCyber Security Reaching a Tipping Point\nCyber security attacks and attackers are nothing new. Yet, we are at a point in time where we are witnessing dramatic and frightening increases in attack frequency, complexity, size, etc. The hacking community has reached an ideal state in terms of:\n\nAvailability of low cost resources\nDramatic increase in high value, increasingly vulnerable targets putting more and more valuable information online\nA level of maturity where on top of hacking programs and anonymity they enjoy services such as hosting, security and can even leverage public cloud compute power.\n\n\nFigure 1: Ransomware, Botnet, User Database and DDoS are all available at the Dark market\n [You might also like: Cyber Security Predictions: Looking Back at 2016, Peering Ahead to 2017]\nInternet of Things (IoT) Botnets Open the 1Tbps Floodgates\nAs the first IoT open-source botnet, Mirai exemplifies why preparing for “common” attacks is no longer enough. The infamous attacks against Brian Krebs, OVH and DynDNS introduced – on top of the record-breaking volumes – sophisticated vectors such as GRE floods and DNS water torture. These events change the rules of real-time mitigation and makes security automation a must. The fact that Mirai is open-source code means hackers can potentially mutate and customize it—resulting in an untold variety of new attack tools that can only be detected by intelligent automation such as behavioral analysis or machine learning. In Radware’s survey, 55% of security professionals indicated they believe the Internet of Things complicates either their detection or mitigation requirements.\nNon-Volumetric DoS: Alive and Kicking\nYet, the IoT botnet headlines are somewhat misleading. While this threat of astonishing volumes is certainly valid, the reality of most business is different. Neither the number of victims nor the frequency of attacks has grown. For example, 70% of non-volumetric DDoS attacks are below 100MBps. These attacks have a financial impact on businesses in the form of latency and poor user experience, consuming bandwidth and network resources. This impact is instantly translated to lower conversion rates and revenue loss. Companies need to rethink their security strategy and embrace more sophisticated solutions as rate-based security solutions continue to fall short.\nStateful Devices: #1 Point of Failure\nIn such conditions – whether it is a high volumetric botnet or a Low-and-Slow DoS attack – common IT devices, including firewalls, application delivery controllers and intrusion protection systems, represent the greatest risk for an outage, as their connection tables are getting quickly filled and they crash due to resource consumption. Consequently, they require a dedicated attack-mitigation solution to protect them.\nCyber-Ransom Proves Easiest, Most Lucrative Tool for Cybercriminals\nPrior to the headline-catchy IoT botnet attacks, organizations across the globe suffered a ransom tsunami coming mainly as a variant in the form of hundreds of encrypting malware types, many of which were developed and discovered this year as part of the hype. The other form was extortion letters followed by DDoS attacks. This has proven to be a very beneficial tool for cyber criminals to make easy money. Some groups made DDoS-for-ransom a profession, leveraging a set of network and application attacks. Their success quickly drew followers and copycats joining the ransom bash. 41% of organizations named ransomware as the #1 motivation behind cyber-attacks they suffered this year.\n\n [You might also like: 2016: The Year of Cyber Ransom]\nThat finding corresponds with the #1 business concern cited by organizations, which is data loss. For example, in 2016 Radware witnessed medical records traded for a higher value than credit cards in Darknet marketplaces. Another example is social and political protests accompanied by cyber-attacks targeting governments and civil service in an attempt to reveal confidential documents – either to prove their claims or simply as a revenge.\nCyber-Attacks Cost Almost Twice What You May Think\nAlthough cyber-ransom attacks make it is easier to estimate the financial losses caused by an attack, most businesses (60%) are in the dark when it comes to understanding the actual losses associated with a cyber-attack. Those who do quantify the various aspects of the losses estimate the damage at nearly double the amount compared to those who have no measurable practice of estimation.\n\nUncrossed Chasm? Security Strategy Evolves More Slowly Than It Should\nThe cost issue is just one example of the growing gap between the defenders and offenders. While organizations battle budget, bureaucracy, and expertise – hackers are much more agile in developing new attack tools and techniques. The result of the two different cruising speeds is an ever-expanding chasm between the businesses and perpetrators. Will the gap ever shrink? Not in the near future. The answer, I’m afraid, will only come after a few years when the majority of organizations will adopt security solutions based on machine learning, behavioral analysis and continuously adaptive models.\n\nWhat Else Changed in Security from 2016?\nWhether you want to know more about today’s attack vector landscape, understand the business impact of cyber-attacks on organizations, or learn more about emerging attack types and tools, this report is for you.

By 2020, it is estimated that the number of connected devices is expected to grow exponentially to 50 billion. A survey by HP indicates that about 70% of these devices have vulnerabilities, making them the perfect targets for botnets like Mirai.\n\nBelow is a collection of 10 blogs written by industry experts on this topic, that will help you fully understand the implications of this botnet and what it means for the future of connected devices.\n\n\nInternet of Things or Internet of Threats? IoT is the ability for devices to be connected the Internet and communicate with other devices – think a thermostat knowing automatically when to heat your home without you having to take an action.

This blog will walk you through the two-part dilemma that is faced when it comes to using these devices and provide a background of the IoT.\nNine Questions to Ask to Determine IoT Device Safety: If you’re familiar with the IoT, then you’re aware of some of the risks that come with connected devices. From January 5-8, consumers and reporters alike will be flooding Las Vegas, Nevada for the Consumer Electronics Show to learn more about new devices making their debut in 2017. This blog by APAC Security Evangelist David Hobbs will provide nine questions you should ask the manufacturers (regardless of whether you are a consumer or reporter) about the safety of these devices.\nIoT Botnets the Fault of Manufacturers, 69 Percent of Consumers Report in Radware Survey: So you own a connected device, but it was attacked and used to launch a DDoS attack. Who is at fault? According to a survey conducted by Harris on behalf of Radware, 69% of consumers would blame the manufacturer. This blog provides additional results of that survey.\nBusyBox Botnet Mirai – the warning we’ve all been waiting for? Radware’s EMEA Security Evangelist, Pascal Geenens, takes us back to where it began – the attack on KrebsOnSecurity. As he states, “The most concerning fact, and the genius of Mirai, resides in its simplicity for victimizing IoT devices.” This blog will outline how the Mirai botnet works.\nThe deplorable state of IoT security: Following the public release of Mirai, the security community began to grow extremely concerned about the potential for additional attacks of that nature. In his second blog, Pascal discusses how the state of IoT security presents a prime opportunity for more attacks.\nHow Friday’s Massive DDoS Attack on the U.S. Happened: DNS servers are a like a roadmap to the internet and help users find the websites they are looking for. When an attacker ties up all of the DNS’s resources, legitimate clients are unable to resolve their request. Radware’s ERT Researcher, Daniel Smith, outlines how the attack on Dyn DNS happened in this blog.\nLet’s discuss facts: An insight into Mirai’s source-code: After three major cyber-attacks, speculation abounded on who the attackers were, what their motivation was, the exact attack vectors and the traffic volumes. In this blog post, Radware’s Snir Ben Shimol discusses what we know to be the facts about these attacks.\nRise of the Machines: How IoT broke the Internet, and the day after tomorrow: In a guest post by Zeina Zakhour, Global CTO of Cyber Security for Atos, she discusses the repercussions of these attacks and what consumers can do to try to prevent similar attacks from occurring again.\nIs Heat Your Thermostat’s First Priority? Remember that smart thermostat that we mentioned? A hacker performed a DDoS attack on a heating distribution system that controlled the heating of two large apartment blocks in Finland back in November, shutting off heat for 20,000 residents. In the Dyn DNS attack, it was discovered that a handful of connected devices, mainly IP cameras, DVRs and routers, were the ones infected by Mirai and used in the attack. In this blog, Pascal discusses how that relates to your smart devices, like thermostats, and whether you should be concerned.\nCyber Security Predictions: Looking Back at 2016, Peering Ahead to 2017: What do we see on the docket for 2017? We correctly predicted in the 2015–2016 Global Application and Network Security Report that we would see the rise of the Internet of Things, which spawned the largest DDoS attack in history. Radware’s Vice President of Security Solutions, Carl Herberger, discusses our predictions for 2017 in this blog post.\n\nThe conversation is still going on the record-breaking volume of the Mirai botnet attack, and doesn’t show signs of slowing.

Below is a round-up of some of our most popular blog posts to bring you up to speed on this threat:\n\n\nIntroduction to Cyber Ransom\nNot sure where to start? This blog by our ERT Researcher Daniel Smith is a great place to get an overview of this type of attack. He’ll walk you through how to determine if a ransom note is real or fake, some of the attackers at the forefront of this trend, and what motivates them to engage in cyber ransom.\nRead it here: Ransom, Ransom Everywhere\nC-Suite Research\nWhat do the C-suite think? We surveyed more than 200 security executives about a number of cyber security issues, one of which was how they would respond to ransom, or have responded in the past. Our research also breaks down the differences in response between the United States and United Kingdom. This blog post dips into that research and discusses how security is becoming more of a priority for top-level executives.\nRead it here: A View from the Corner Offices: New Research on C-Suite Security Mindset\nConsumers Feeling the Burn, Too\nIt’s not just organizations that are targeted by ransom attacks – consumers are also victims as well. When it comes to individual consumers, the motivations can be different. But as with our C-suite research, actions don’t always match beliefs – whether or not a ransom is paid depends greatly on age range, with Millennials more likely to pay. This blog covers that research conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Radware.\nRead it here: Millennials Most Likely to Pay a Ransom When Data is Digitally Hijacked\nSo What About 2017?\nRadware is predicting that we could see a number of different cyber-attack scenarios occur in the next year, including seeing ransom attacks get more personal.

We see many enterprises who may have only implemented IPV6 at the internet side of their organization and not internally due to a variety of reasons. The challenge many face by not implementing IPV6 is that current threats can begin to take advantage of that lack of visibility or mitigation.\nBecause the current major operating systems come with IPV6 enabled, malware can begin to auto-configure the network. There has been a recent increase of malicious code that enables IPv6 on a compromised host, creating a potentially undetected channel for an attacker to exploit. Nefarious web sites offer tools that can be used to exploit IPv6 for malicious purposes. These tools include relay6, 6tunnel, nt6tunnel, asybo and many more. These tools can be used for legitimate purposes to facilitate communication between IPv6 and IPv4 devices and applications. However, they can be misused for malware tunneling and routing.\nOne of the other places where we are seeing a rise in IPV6 abuse is in Teredo Tunneling. Teredo is a transition technology that gives full IPv6 connectivity for IPv6-capable hosts that are on the IPv4 Internet, but have no native connection to an IPv6 network. Unlike similar protocols, it can perform its function even from behind NAT devices such as home routers.\n [You might also like: Nine Questions to Ask to Determine IoT Device Safety]\nTeredo operates using a platform-independent tunneling protocol that provides IPv6 connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 datagram packets within IPv4 User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. Teredo routes these datagrams on the IPv4 Internet and through NAT devices. Teredo nodes elsewhere on the IPv6 network (called Teredo relays) receive the packets, un-encapsulate them, and pass them on.\nA number of Bit Torrent trackers started taking advantage of Teredo Tunnels and would work with configuration of Teredo. What this would do is allow the Torrent user to bypass the firewall security mechanisms for blocking Torrent users. Some clients would use encrypted UDP over known ports (like SIP or DNS) and could exit a protected network by appearing to be harmless. The IPv4 network becomes a transit for these tunnels off to the DarkNet, where IPv6 relays provide anonymity and evasion from detection mechanisms. Malware can also take advantage of the same overlay network mechanisms and go undetected due to lack of IPv6 implementations.\nRecently, we saw that 5% of the CCTV Botnet was using IPv6. When the Internet of Things (IoT) fully adapts to IPv6, we will begin to see a rise in DDoS botnets leveraging IPv6. In the Mirai Botnet, we are seeing IPv6-enabled devices in the attack matrix sending out floods. The Mirai Botnet has reached over 1 Tbps in size for flooding attacks. That same 5% of IPv6 hosts could essentially produce 50Gbps of DDoS flooding. It’s very possible this is just the beginning of this sort of attack vector.\nWithout visibility, companies are blind to potential hidden IPV6 networks. Because of Teredo and other encapsulation strategies, we are going to see more hidden attack vectors in the future. I predict that the increase of IPv6 exploits will become a more common headache for years to come. This small adoption rate globally has made this a very open exposure for security vulnerabilities. Have you implemented detection mechanisms for IPv6? If you detect threats, do you have active mitigation?\nWe recommend that companies DO implement IPv6 sooner than later.\n• Use dual stack as your preferred IPv6 migration choice\n• Use static tunneling rather than dynamic tunneling\n• Implement outbound filtering on firewall devices to allow only authorized\ntunneling endpoints\n• Filter internal-use IPv6 addresses at organization border routers\n• Filter unneeded services at the edge of the network and Firewalls\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'IPv6\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/12/ipv6-security-today/');

It’s not a great sign after a year when ransom attacks locked up patient records at hospitals and disabled MUNI ticket machines in San Francisco. The attacks included ransomware, ransom DDoS, and other threats designed to extort money from unprepared organizations. Many variants arose, including Locky and Petya that propagate through spam emails and phishing, respectively; Samas, which exploits webserver vulnerabilities; and Cerber, which imitates an Adobe Flash player update.\n\nWhile many attacks have targeted organizations and businesses, consumers have felt the brunt as well. Yet two-thirds of consumers who have personal files stored on a computer/mobile device (66 percent) said they wouldn’t pay a ransom to unlock their personal files if a hacker encrypted them.\nSome, however, are more likely to pay than others. The willingness to pay a ransom varied by age group, with younger consumers who have personal files stored on a computer/mobile device more likely to pay up than their older counterparts. More than half of 18-34 year olds (53 percent) were willing to pay, as were 48 percent of 35-44 year olds. Just 25 percent of 45-54 year olds said the same thing, along with 20 percent of 55-64 year olds and only 15 percent of those ages 65+. This suggests that younger demographics may value digital assets more than older ones, perhaps in part because they have more music, photos, personal financial data, and other assets at stake.\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nYounger consumers who have personal files stored on a computer/mobile device are also more likely to pay more money to get their data back compared to their older counterparts. One in five 18-34 year olds (21 percent) and 35-44 year olds (20 percent) said they would pay $200 or more to regain access to their personal files. Just 8 percent of 45-54 year olds, 6 percent of 55-64 year olds, and 3 percent of those ages 65+ said the same thing.\n\nWhile 66 percent of consumers said they wouldn’t pay, what they would actually do if infected with ransomware remains to be seen. In our 2016 Executive Application and Network Security report, we found that among C-suite respondents who hadn’t been hit with ransom attacks, 84 percent said they wouldn’t pay. Among those who had actually been attacked, 43 percent paid. Beliefs don’t always match actions when data is at stake.\nConsumers are particularly vulnerable, as they lack the resources, support, and secure systems many large companies have at their disposal to ward off or recover from attacks. College students have been one common target, as most have nowhere to turn to recover their files. It’s easier to pay up and get their hard drive back.\nAs mobile ransomware becomes more common – threats were 15 times higher in June 2016 than April 2015 – the stakes rise, as phones hold more personal and more valuable data that both organizations and consumers could be willing to pay to get back.\nBut you should only pay a ransom if you want to keep paying. One reason ransom attacks became so common and widespread in 2016 was because they’re effective and lucrative. Stop paying, and shut off the cash flow, and ransom might slow its rapid rise.\nThe majority of consumers have the right idea about how to respond to ransom attacks, but millennials would be wise to second guess their instinct to pay up.\nSurvey Methodology:\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Radware from November 14-16, 2016 among 2,059 U.S. adults ages 18 and older.

Using the Mirai malware, hackers harnessed 100,000 internet-connected devices in a DDoS attack that reportedly reached 1.2 Tbps. Those devices, from cameras to DVRs, are often consumer-owned, and we wanted to see what consumers thought of their devices being co-opted for these attacks.\nWe asked them where they’d point fingers if their devices are compromised and used as part of an IoT botnet.\n\nSome 69 percent of consumers hold device manufacturers responsible for making sure devices in consumers’ homes can’t be manipulated by hackers to launch attacks against others, according to a new study among over 2,000 U.S. adults conducted online on behalf of Radware by Harris Poll.\n\nThis makes sense, and manufacturers deserve the pressure consumers are putting on them. An HP study shows that 70 percent of IoT devices contain vulnerabilities. It turns out the race to bring the world online has included a few shortcuts.\nBecause these devices often use factory default credentials, have root passwords that can’t be changed, and have Telnet or SSH enabled, the devices are essentially Trojans with a secret backdoor. And when many manufacturers source their boards and software from the same sources, it creates vast numbers of devices easily compromised.\n [You might also like: How Friday’s Massive DDoS Attack on the U.S. Happened]\nManufacturers’ software development lifecycles should take the security of the devices more seriously, and a number of simple steps could prevent future attacks, including requiring a change to default passwords and enabling Over The Air (OTA) software updates to patch vulnerabilities.\nWithout manufacturer action to secure these devices, IoT botnet attacks will only continue to grow, as we saw recently when hackers attempted to infect 900,000 internet routers in Germany with malware. Had they successfully harnessed a botnet that large, the DDoS attack they would be capable of generating an unprecedentedly massive DDoS attack.\nBut manufacturers aren’t the only ones consumers feel should be responsible for preventing misuse of their devices by hackers. More than half of consumers (55 percent) point fingers at internet service providers (ISPs) and cellular carriers.\nManufacturers have clear steps they could take to better secure devices, but blaming ISPs and cellular carriers is more complicated. While some attacks come in through a single ISP, collective attacks originate from many thousands of IoT devices that are presumably sending traffic across a large number of ISPs and carriers. That immediately makes detection and mitigation of some vectors difficult if not impossible for an ISP. Not to mention that some attacks look like legitimate traffic and ISPs would have trouble blocking them without network or application behavioral visibility.\nSecurity solutions enterprises deploy should have device fingerprinting. IP addresses have lost the security value they once held, given dynamic IP addresses, global Network Address Translation (NAT), and anonymous proxies. While in the past, an IP address might lead back to a device or user, they’re all but meaningless today. Device fingerprinting, however, uses dozens of attributes to identify a device and track activities, creating a behavioral and reputational profile.\nUltimately manufacturers need to fix the vulnerabilities in their many internet-connected devices, but there’s no clear sign of when or how that will happen.\nSurvey Methodology:\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Radware from November 14-16, 2016 among 2,059 U.S. adults ages 18 and older.

In fact, Gartner says 6.4 billion connected “things” will be in use in 2016, up 30 percent from 2015.  By 2020, it is estimated that the number of connected devices is expected to grow exponentially to 50 billion.\n\nWhile IoT brings forth many benefits to consumers—from convenience to energy efficiency, to monitoring babies and locating lost pets—it also brings risk.  The Mirai botnet enslaved 152,000 IoT devices including: Smart TVs, refrigerators, and other smart household appliances.  These IoT devices were used them to take out the Dyn DNS Server this September.\n [You might also like: Is Heat Your Thermostat’s First Priority?]\nAs a consumer, you might think… “why should I care if my device is involved in a DDoS attack? As long as it works, I don’t mind.” Well, some 20,000 residents in Finland found out the hard way why it matters, when their building’s IoT connected thermostats stopped functioning because the devices were enslaved to a botnet conducting a DDoS attack (By the way, it’s cold in Finland in November).\nWhether you are a consumer considering a connected device as a gift for the holidays, or a reporter about to review the next wave of IoT devices launching at CES, we have put together a list of questions you should ask before diving in:\n\nWhat are you (the manufacturer) doing to protect devices from botnet enslavement?\nIf the device does become enslaved, will it still perform its primary function?\nIf it breaks during a DDoS attack, will you (manufacturer) honor the warrantee?\nWhat is your security vulnerability disclosure/handling process?\nWhat personal information is stored on the device? Which user accounts (e.g. email, cloud service, etc.)?\n\nHow do you protect that data?\n\n\nWhich services are enabled by default?\nDoes it need to be directly exposed to the internet (e.g. using UPnP to create a port-forwarding rule in the internet gateway)\nWhat is the procedure to upgrade the device firmware?\n\nHow do users receive notifications of updates?\nDo you offer support for OTA (Over the Air) updates?\n\n\nDo you provide a web page/contact for security researchers to submit security reports? For example: https://nest.com/security/\n\nMany manufacturers are not ready to answer these questions.  Not only do many manufacturers not include security features in their product development, it’s not even in their scope of thought.  What’s worse, we’ve seen some manufacturers who have command and control enabled by default for eavesdropping!\nFor the consumers of these devices, you may find that you’re faced with the Wild West of security concerns.  Without having a home firewall or Unified Threat Manager (UTM), how will you know that the devices you’ve bought aren’t spying on you or leaking your personal details? How many consumers even know what a UTM is, or where to purchase and install one?\nCompanies face the same challenges.  Larger companies segment the devices from their production networks.  The areas where rapid adoption is happening is where the greatest vulnerabilities lay.  We believe that industry standards must to come to the table in 2017.   Secure communication protocols and standards will become public standards and IoT manufacturers will have certifications to these standards.  We predict a major IoT breach is going to happen and perhaps that will be the catalyst toward securing the Internet of Things.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/12/nine-questions-to-determine-iot-device-safety/');

Internet of Things (IoT) threats became a reality and somewhat paradoxically spawned the first 1TBs DDoS—the largest DDoS attack in history. Radware predicted these and other 2016 events in the 2015–2016 Global Application and Network Security Report. Since initiating this annual report, we have built a solid track record of successfully forecasting how the threat landscape will evolve. While some variables stay the course, the industry moves incredibly quickly, and it takes just one small catalyst to spark a new direction that nobody could have predicted.\nLet’s take a look back at how our predictions fared in 2016—and then explore what Radware sees on the horizon for 2017.\n\n\nRadware’s Cyber Security Prediction Report Card\n\n\n\nPrediction\nCurrent Status\nDid We Get it Right?\n\n\nAdvanced Persistent Denial of Service (APDoS) as Standard Operating Procedure\nAPDoS is an attack technique that leverages multi-vector attack campaigns targeting various layers of the victim’s IT infrastructure. The majority of today’s cyber-attacks are now multi-vector.\n \n\n\nContinued Rise of Ransom Denial of Service (RDoS)\n \n2016 was the year of cyber-ransom, with 56% of companies reporting being threatened. While we predicted that cloud companies would be the main targets, it turns out that ransomware affected just about every type of business.\n \n\n\nPrivacy as a Right (Not Just a Regulation)\nThe United States and European Union reached the “Privacy Shield” agreement in May of 2016, followed by a debate about whether or not it accurately reflects the morals of personal privacy.\n \n\n\nMore Laws Governing Sensitive Data\nUnder the U.S. Federal Communications Commission’s  (FCC) new rules in favor of online privacy, consumers may forbid Internet providers from using and selling their data.\n \n\n\nThe Internet of Zombies\nEveryone’s talking about the Mirai IoT botnet and its record-breaking volumes!\n \n\n\nArrival of Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) Attacks (Albeit Very Slowly)\n“Very slowly” turned out to be the operative words. While there were a few examples in 2016, we foresee this threat gaining momentum in 2017.\n \n\n\nGrowing Encryption to and from Cloud Applications\nSSL-based attacks grew 10% year over year. Yet encrypting traffic to and from cloud applications requires additional resources, including overcoming the certificate management challenge.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s on the Horizon\nFor years there has been talk about the imminent threat of a dire cyber-attack that cripples society as we know it. There’s even a TV show about what it might look like. But what are the actual possibilities for such an occurrence? What follows are some very plausible cyber-attack profiles and scenarios for the upcoming year. Read them for pleasure—and preparation.\n [You might also like: 2016 Attack Trends]\nPrediction 1: Rise of Permanent Denial of Service (PDoS) for Data Center and IoT Operations\nImagine a fast-moving bot attack designed not to collect data but rather to completely prevent a victim’s technology from functioning. Sounds unlikely, but it’s possible. Permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attacks have been around for a long time; however, this type of attack shows itself spectacularly to the public only from time to time.\nAlso known loosely as “phlashing” in some circles, PDoS is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. By exploiting security flaws or misconfigurations, PDoS can destroy the firmware and/or basic functions of system. It is a contrast to its well-known cousin, the DDoS attack, which overloads systems with requests meant to saturate resources through unintended usage.\nOne method PDoS leverages to accomplish its damage is remote or physical administration on the management interface of the victim’s hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. In the case of firmware attacks, the attacker may use vulnerabilities to replace a device’s basic software with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware image—a process which when done legitimately, is known as phlashing. This “bricks” the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced. Other attacks include overloading the battery or power systems.\nExamples include:\n\nAn article published by Help Net Security detailed a new USB exploit that, when inserted into a computer, can render the machine bricked. According to Help Net, the latest PDoS USB attack “when plugged into a computer … draws power from the device itself. With the help of a voltage converter, the device’s capacitors are charged to 220V, and it releases a negative electric surge into the USB port.”\n\n\nAn article in Dark Reading highlighted PhlashDance, a tool uncovered by HP Labs. PhlashDance finds vulnerabilities in often forgotten firmware and binaries that sit locally on computing devices. The risk occurs when a device hasn’t been properly patched and upgraded. The article states that “remotely abusing firmware update mechanisms with a phlashing attack, for instance, is basically a one-shot attack. Phlashing attacks can achieve the goal of disrupting service without ongoing expense to the attacker; once the firmware has been corrupted, no further action is required for the DOS condition to continue.”\n\n\nRecent safety hazard incidents of the Samsung Note 7 is stoking concerns about devices that can be intentionally set on fire. There have been numerous test cases of malware and bots overheating devices, causing them to physically distort or worse. These attacks, bundled into a cyber-attack, could have devastating and lasting effects beyond what we commonly think about in the world of the “nuisance” DDoS attack.\n\nPrediction 2: Telephony DoS (TDoS) Will Rise in Sophistication and Importance, Catching Many by Surprise\nCutting off communications during crisis periods would impede first responders’ situational awareness, exacerbate suffering and pain, and potentially increase loss of life. A new cyber era could consist of multiple components—including a physical attack with a corresponding cyber-attack targeting the communications systems that first responders use to contain and minimize damage.\nCan the day be far away where a terrorist attack is magnified by an effective outage of first responders’ communication platforms? If you doubt the feasibility, review this bulletin. It was issued in 2013 by public safety organizations asking for assistance in cracking a TDoS attack against 911 emergency response systems.\nPrediction 3: Ransom Attacks Become More Segmented, More Real, and More Personal\nRadware predicts that cyber-ransomers extend their reach beyond companies. In 2017, ransom attacks could get personal.\nHackers target personal implanted health devices. Imagine if your life depended on an implanted defibrillator or other medical device. Now imagine if such a device were hacked and held for ransom. The idea of hacking defibrillators is not science fiction. Cyber ransom is the fastest-growing motive and technique in cyber-attacks. Can a marriage between the two be far off? For those unfamiliar with these risks and U.S. Government-issued warnings in this category, please refer to the FDA’s Advice to Medical Device Manufacturers, a summary of FBI & DHS alerts on Internet of things and these warnings on cyber ransom.\nPublic transportation held hostage. In many ways, cyber ransoming a public transportation system is the ultimate hack—empowering attackers to hold a community hostage for financial or criminal gain. If you live in France, the United States or many other countries, you may have grown accustomed to railway or airline workers striking and wreaking havoc on the communities around them.\nFrom trains and planes to buses and automobiles, entire systems of transportation are becoming more automated. This automation is meant to provide increased safety, improved reliability and higher efficiencies. But is it really providing those things? If you have been following cyber-security threats to public transportation as closely as we have, you likely know there have already been many attacks—some of which have distinguished themselves as harbingers of future attack categories. (In case you missed it, a recent Radware blog post shares four real-world examples that help illustrate the problem.)\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nJust as other forms of transportation face increased threats, so does the aviation industry. Like water, aviation terror threats tend to take the path of least resistance. Via external analyses and documented evidence, we know that the aviation sector is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. How long will it be until terror strikes evolve in the aviation industry—as they have around the world—to the cyber front? If you have responsibility for any aspect of these areas, please don’t be a bystander. Be proactive about onboarding controls and saving lives.\nIf transportation systems are vulnerable, could ransoming of these systems be far behind? If so, what would politicians pay for a return to operations and safety for their constituencies? Does “pay-for-play” government behavior reward the pursuit of future combinations of terrorism and crime?\nMilitary devices ransomed. Military branches have long been heavy technology users. They have also had a technology procurement model based on an outdated approach and xenophobic buying behavior. In a world of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, goods are procured fairly at will.  Will these COTS packages—frequently made with large amounts of foreign components be the small pebbles that undermine the operational capabilities of the world’s largest military forces? Seemingly innocuous cameras, sensors and other IoT devices pervade the military—but are just as rife with security issues as any on the planet. Once demonstrable vulnerabilities are validated, how much would a government pay to regain control of weapons or other crucial resources?\n\n [You might also like: Darknet 101: An Introduction to The Darkest Places Online]\nPrediction 4: The Darknet Goes Mainstream\nMany people live two or more lives:  one life in flesh and blood; and the other life or lives are various online avatars, which are essential for highly functioning citizenry. These avatars span health, finances, education, love interests, and more. Today the Darknet offers easy, affordable access to terrorize or otherwise alter someone’s personal avatar for financial or other benefits. What, exactly, do we mean? Here are a few examples of what 2017 could bring:\n\nCompromised surveillance systems available for rent, enabling someone to see through another person’s cameras\nAccess to FBI files and lawsuit information\nAccess to emails and computer systems of people going through a divorce, as well as teachers’ personal communications or lawyers’ strategic documents and communications\nPersonal medical records or previous criminal activity or misdemeanors\n\nIn the face of these frightening prospects, who is the definitive source of who we are, and how do we reconcile file/record issues? Before you answer, picture yourself in a job interview. You provide one set of information about your educational history; a report from your school serves up conflicting data. Who rules the day?\nThis analogy can be extended to numerous scenarios. The common thread: that your online avatar now represents and requires high security and fidelity in order for you to function properly in society. In light of that, one of the single most personalized acts of terror that can occur is a wide-scale loss, alteration or deletion of records—with no reconstitution capability. This should strike fear in us all.\nIs the Best Behind Us?\nThe conclusion we draw from all of these predictions: If growth of attack surface, techniques and means continues into 2017, then the best years of security of our systems may be behind us. As we move forward into 2017, Radware views these as key questions to explore:\n\nWith physical terror playing such a major role in global strife, how could cyber-security sabotage NOT be far behind?\n\n\nGiven the threat landscape, what controls/testing can be performed to ensure that the public risk is abated through proactive measures—and that private scenarios are regulated so that we can trust our Internet avatar system as we trust our financial system?\n\nGiven the evolution of threats and the importance of the sanctity and trustworthiness of online systems, government needs to step in and provide something akin to a Federal Bureau of Cyber Security with a separate and distinct charter. This agency’s role would be equivalent to the physical Secret Service in numerous ways. However, its operating space and domain would be one with the ghostly characteristics of computer warfare. In defending the citizenry, this agency would need to cover freedoms of press and speech overall.\nNo matter when or how the government responds, each organization has a responsibility to be aware and prepared. Radware urges you to contemplate how our 2017 predictions could affect your organization and the people you serve—then work to devise appropriate strategies and controls for mitigating the risks.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'apdos\', \'botnet\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Denial of Service\', \'DoS\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'mirai', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/12/cyber-security-predictions-2017/');

The attack is a two-step attack; the attacker sends a large amount of requests to one or more legitimate DNS servers while using spoofed source IP of the target victim. The DNS server receiving the semi-legitimate requests replies to the spoofed IP, thereby unknowingly launching an attack on the target victim with responses to requests that the victim never sent.\nThe internet is full of DNS servers offered as open-resolvers which will serve any request sent to them, some reports name millions as the amount. This huge number makes it very hard to pre-identify the attack using IP reputation. Furthermore, the servers are actually legitimate servers that usually send legitimate traffic, making any IP reputation service confused about whether or not their nature is malicious.\n\nMost DNS queries are sent using UDP, a protocol that does not enable source IP validation. This is why the intermediary DNS server assumes the requests are arriving from the victim and sends the replies back to him. The IP spoofing makes it extremely difficult for the victim server to detect the attacker, as it appears as if it is being attacked by a legitimate DNS server, and the attacker IP is completely hidden. IP spoofing also invalidates IP reputation services, which, if not written properly, may assign a bad reputation to a legitimate DNS server. It also removes any tractability for security expects trying to identify the attack source.\n \nAnother advantage for spoofing is the ability to attack any server or service.  The attacker can use the victim’s public server IP and port to make sure the attack is sent to any service, not just a DNS service. The traffic will simply look like a lot of data and the server will have to parse and examine the data to ensure it is not legitimate traffic.\nNote that the IP spoofing is also a limitation of this attack – if IP spoofing is not possible, the attack cannot be launched as there is no way to direct the responses to the victim’s IP. This is the case with the Mirai bots running on IoT devices behind a router that performs NAT. However, recent Mirai infection tactics are aiming at the home routers themselves, thus bypassing the NAT limitation.\nThe latest and biggest advantage contributing to the destructive potential of reflective DNS floods is amplification, which can be achieved using DNS extensions (EDNS0, defined in RFC 2671) and DNSSec. EDNS0 allows the DNS response to be larger than the original 512 allowed, while DNSSec allows authentication of the response to prevent cache poisoning. DNSSec requires EDNS0 to operate since it adds cryptographic data to the response. Since DNSSec is becoming popular in today’s security-aware internet, it makes more and more DNS servers support EDNS0 and allows an attacker to achieve large responses to their requests.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nThe possible size of the response – up to 4096 bytes, allows the attacker to send a small number of short requests, while the replies sent by the DNS server are greatly amplified, exhausting the victim’s internet pipe. Attackers can study the DNS server and find which legitimate queries can result in large replies, and also use DNSSec to make them even bigger with cryptographic data.  In many cases, the response can get up to the maximum of 4096 bytes, which gives an amplification factor of x100 for the original request.\n [You might also like: DNS and DNS Attacks]\nWith today’s large internet connectivity, a 100 M connection to the internet can send a modest attack on its own and still cause some damage to a normal site. However, if the attacker has the ability to use this huge 4096 bytes’ response for his 44bytes request and get 100x amplification, the victim server will receive 10G of attack traffic, above its normal traffic bandwidth. Such traffic will cause any normal service to immediately become out of service. Imagine what can be achieved with a botnet of even few of such bots.\nAdding to the size of the response, comes the fact that such responses cannot fit into a normal IP packet. In cases such as this, servers use the IP-fragmentation option, which allows them to divide the message into several packets. Using fragmented traffic in the attack makes the attack mitigation even harder – the mitigator needs to store the first packet’s layer 4 data (UDP ports) in a table and apply it to the rest of the packets from the same message. Many network entities are fast exhausted by a lot of fragmented traffic, which makes this attack even more efficient.\nRadware’s YouTube DNS amplification attack Video graphically illustrates the structure and flow of a Reflective DNS attack.\nAfter learning all the ins and outs of the DNS reflective attack, one thing remains – how to protect an organization against such attack and mitigate it? Unlike the sophistication of the attack itself, this problem has a known solution – in order to mitigate a DNS reflection attack, you have to have a good detector on-site to quickly detect the attack and prevent downtime. The detector should be smart enough to understand that the attack it sees is saturating the internet connection and traffic diversion needs to take place to a cloud scrubbing center. Once traffic is diverted to cloud scrubbing, it will be cleaned and sent to the site.\nThe scrubbing itself depends on the amount of similar traffic which is considered legit – does the site sees a lot of UDP traffic? DNS traffic? Fragmented traffic? And if so, what distinguishes it from the attack traffic? Using an automated technique to separate the legitimate and the attack traffic will give you good and fast cloud mitigation and also, some peace of mind.\nFor more information, check out my previous blog: DNS and DNS Attacks\n\n\nRead “Creating a Safe Environment for Under-Protected APIs” to learn more. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'ddos\', \'dns attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/12/dns-reflective-attacks/');

The blockchain was introduced by a pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008 and open sourced for the currency in 2009. The blockchain serves as a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. One of Bitcoin’s main features is the fact that the system is a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network with no central authority, which means that it provides a certain level of anonymity with no central point of failure, though most services and business that use Bitcoin are centralized in one way or another. While there are numerous legitimate uses for Bitcoin like investing, paying friends or shopping, a number of criminals have adopted the currency for selling services and deploying ransom campaigns due to its level of anonymity.\n\nThe Bitcoin “Bank Account”\nBefore you can purchase Bitcoin, you will need somewhere to store it. An online Bitcoin wallet and exchange is accessible via the web from a browser or a cellphone. Some exchanges like Coinbase even offer an application for both Android and iPhone that makes buying and selling Bitcoin and in-store purchases very simple. Paper wallets are a form of cold storage with the address and private keys printed on them from offline computers. By printing the paper wallets offline, the exposure for your wallet being compromised is greatly reduced. There are even hardware wallets specifically designed to securely hold your Bitcoin. Once you have a wallet, you will then be able to buy and deposit your Bitcoin along with sending and receiving it.\n\nHow to Purchase Bitcoin\nUsers wishing to invest, purchase or shop using the digital currency only have to take a few basic steps before being able to use Bitcoin. You can either purchase it online at a number of digital exchanges or locally at a Bitcoin ATM. Another way to accumulate it is to accept it for goods and services.\nThere are a number of online exchanges you can use to purchase Bitcoin. Exchanges like Kraken, BitStamp, and OkCon all offer services where you can buy it online. Coinbase is one of my favorite online exchanges and one I use personally. Their app is very user friendly and convenient to use.\n [You might also like: Threat Alert – Bitcoin Exchanges and Websites Experiencing DDoS Attacks]\nOn Coinbase you can convert your local currency into and out of Bitcoin and ethereum, another cryptocurrency, by linking your wallet to your bank account. You can also use debit and credit cards to purchase BTC on Coinbase. Coinbase allows users the ability to buy and sell items with their app at local vendors as well. To send money you can simply enter the recipients’ BTC address, but if you are purchasing from a local vendor you can use the app to scan the merchant’s Bitcoin address displayed in the form of a QR code. Coinbase also provides a great interface for watching the digital market so you can buy low and sell high, as the value of Bitcoin does rise and fall like the normal stock market.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n\nYou can also purchase Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM if there is one nearby. Here in Brooklyn we have several of them that allow you the ability to purchase and sell Bitcoin at a physical location. Most of the ATMs around here are made by three different companies, BitCOIN, CoinBTM, and CoinSource. My local deli has a two-way Genesis ATM. Limits are varied based on verification status but the machines limit, according to the manufacturer, lets you buy $9,000 USD and sell $2,980 USD a day. Buyer fees range between 7 and 15 percent while selling fees are 3.5% across the board.\n\nWhere can I use Bitcoin?\nSo who uses Bitcoin and where can you use it? A lot of merchants have adopted or used Bitcoin in one way or another over the last few years. Many Ecommerce stores have already embraced Bitcoin technology. You can purchase items on websites like Overstock, Newegg Tiger Direct, and Expedia with Bitcoin. Now, there are also physical stores that accept it. Here in New York City, there is a wide variety of bars, coffee shops and other independent stores that accept Bitcoin.\nPerhaps most notably, Darknet marketplaces like AlphaBay and Hansa, along with the DDoS-for-Hire industry, have adopted BTC as their currency of choice. Even ransomware authors are choosing to accept payments via Bitcoin. Criminals will use a number of methods to anonymously purchase and store ill-gotten BTC through the use of services such as tumblers. Tumblers are online services used to launder Bitcoin in an attempt to mask the coin’s origin or to prevent it from being identified while purchasing illegal goods online.\nAs the currency continues to mature, users will see even more legitimate uses and big name stores accepting Bitcoin. As it grows, more investors will fund projects that result in more secure and enhanced infrastructure. Bitcoin is the first mainstream digital currency, so there will be more growing pains, especially when it comes down to government control and taxes, but at the same time there are many benefits and security features behind accepting the digital currency. One that stands out to me is the fact that criminals cannot steal your payment information from the merchant like they can with credit cards.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bitcoin\', \'cryptocurrency\', \'currency\', \'ecommerce\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/how-to-buy-bitcoin/');

They had to take measures to let people know there would be no fines leveraged from folks unable to complete their online census:\n\n\nThe cyber security adviser to the PM said this was imminently predictable. Nobody has said for certain what the motivation was other than it was âhackersâ who did this. Iâm not sure I would agree that someone having the skill of a hacker these days is required to launch a DDoS attack.

Theyâre grappling with a new breed of cyber-attacks, financially-motivated cyber assailants, and a bevy of new, connected devices (both corporate and employee) that bring unintended security risks to their organization.\nBut itâs not all doom and gloom. C-level executives are relying on new technologies and best practices to fight fire with fire. Theyâre turning to former enemies for help, getting more bang for the buck, and relying on automation to safeguard their organizationâs most critical information assets.\n\n\nTo garner the best practices of security leaders, Radware conducted a survey of more than 200 C-level security executives from the U.S. and United Kingdom. The Security and the C-Suite: Threats and Opportunities Report unearthed a series of top recommendations that organizations should heed carefully.\nPractice #1: Perform greater screening on inbound and outbound data.\nIn open-ended responses, one executive mentioned future plans to increase screening on the traffic entering and leaving the organizationâs network. Such screening represents a significant gap for many organizationsâ and itâs becoming increasingly important to address it. Radware has witnessed an increase in SSL/encryption, making inbound attacks more challenging to detect. Meanwhile, outbound traffic, especially when itâs encrypted, is often not inspected.\nRecommendation: Ensure that network/perimeter protections can inspect encrypted traffic without scale issues. Implement outbound traffic inspection capabilities.\nPractice #2: When it comes to security, know what youâre spending and why.\nThe Executive Report revealed an interesting paradox. A majority of respondents (82%) indicated that cybersecurity is a CEO- or board-level issue. Yet in both the U.S. and the U.K., more than half of executives did not know how much money or time their company has spent on securityâfrom fighting cyber-attacks to implementing safeguards against hackers. Cyber security is simply too important, and poses too much risk, for that lack of executive awareness.\nRecommendation: An organizationâs board and C-suite should assign ownership to ensure transparency on current threats, protection strategy and where/how resources are being used.\nPractice #3: When facing a ransom demand, tread carefully.\nWith ransom attacks on the rise, the report uncovered another paradox. Eighty-four percent said if they were approached by cyber thieves, they wouldnât pay the ransom. Yet among those who were actually attacked, 54% said they did pay. Giving in to cyber thieves can be risky, as paying ransom may not stop the attack and, in fact, might increase the odds of additional incidents.\nRecommendation: Flip the economic equationâinvesting resources into network, endpoint and application security rather than âdonatingâ money to criminals.\n [You might also like: A View From the Corner Offices: New Research on C-Suite Security Mindset]\nPractice #4: Consider using hackers to test your security.\nThe results indicate an increased willingness to use hackers, and with good reason. Hackers bring unique experience and insight as companies work to keep pace with changes to the threat landscape and with the latest tactics, techniques and procedures.\nRecommendation: At a minimum, conduct penetration testing and explore opportunities to engage white hat hackers to make the testing more realisticâand effective.\nPractice #5: Automate security.\nAs the threat landscape becomes increasingly automated, protections need to be too. Forty percent of respondents indicated that have had automation in place for two or more years. That finding contradicts input from the Security Industry Survey, in which respondents said their organizationâs security is 80% manual. What this suggests is that executives may underestimate the extent to which certain security protections are still manual. That may include manual signature development for new attacks, as well as policy generation and vulnerability scanning/patching on applications.\nRecommendation: True automation comes from enabling technology to initiate protectionsânot feeding data into a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) system so that a human can make a decision. Explore multi-vector coverage through coordination of security components.\nCase in Point: Best Practices in Action\nOne Radware customer exemplifies information security innovation. It delivers reliable performance for the companyâs technology backbone, with a DDoS protection strategy that incorporates proactive instead of reactive technology and uses behavioral analysis to minimize impact on legitimate users.\nThis online retailerâs security team also uses a forward-thinking approach for evaluating return on security investments. In most companies, ROI calculations have focused on how much revenue would be lost per hour of downtime, how long it would take to reestablish a site after an attack and the likelihood of an attack taking the site down. More sophisticated analysis might also include cost to the brandâparticularly if a company relies on its online presence for revenue.\nThis Radware customer took a more innovative approach. The security team began to consider how their ability to block bad traffic at the perimeter would positively affect the entire downstream environment. By building strong controls at every level of the infrastructure, the security team provided tools for the companyâs infrastructure and operations teams to process only legitimate traffic.\nThis resulted in a new, often overlooked, formula to measure the financial impacts of DDoS attacks. For DDoS attacks that will not affect the availability of online services, are those malicious attacks worth processing through the entire infrastructure? Aside from downtime, what are the downsides of having this traffic at any time in the infrastructure? Because of the velocity, volume and frequency of DDoS attacks, many data centers are processing massive quantities of malicious data. Processing that âillegitimateâ traffic alongside online customersâ legitimate traffic has significant operational and financial impact.\nOnce the security team started to calculate the cost of bad traffic that was now blocked at the perimeter and removed from downstream processing, they could quantify the returnâand easily justifyâthe companyâs investments in security.\n\n\nClick here to download Radwareâs “2016 Executive Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/cyber-security-recommendations-c-suite/');

The sad reality behind Social Engineering is it is very easy to do. In fact, it’s so easy that even a teenager can do it and destroy your company, all on a Friday night. The goal is to have the targeted victim divulge confidential information or give you unauthorized access because you have played off their natural human emotion of wanting to help. Being nice is a human trait and everyone wants to be kind and helpful. If you give someone the opportunity to save the day or to feel helpful, they will most likely divulge the information required. Most of the time the attacker’s motives are to either gather information for a future attack, to commit fraud or to gain system access for malicious activity.\n\nAttackers often use Social Engineering techniques as their first vector of attack because it consistently works. There are many different people that use Social Engineering techniques other than hackers. Penetration testers and spies to fraudsters and everyday people use these techniques as well to accomplish their goal and get what they need. Even Information Security professionals fall for well-crafted Social Engineering attempts every now and then. Nearly everyone has been targeted by a Social Engineer. There is no patch for human error and that’s why Social Engineering often works. Common targets for Social Engineering include positions like customer service and tech support to delivery agents and your everyday employee.\nSocial Engineering within the context of computer security comes in many forms and from a wide variety of attackers. Their techniques include social and computer related methods to gain information from their target. It’s easier for hackers to trick a person into giving up sensitive information than it is to obtain the same material from compromising a device. Below are some of the common tactics used by hackers to gain access to sensitive information.\nPhishing\nPhishing is a digital attempt to obtain sensitive information from a victim by using a malicious email or website. The attacker solicits personal information by posing as a trustworthy organization or the company itself. These attempts are either sent out to everyone in the company or designed to specifically target key associates. Once an associate falls victim to this attack, the hacker will then have the sensitive information required to gain access to certain systems.\n\nSMS based Phishing attempt – America is spelled incorrectly\n\nSMS based Phishing attempt’s website – Asks for card number and SSN\n [You might also like: Profile of a Hacker]\nBaiting\nBaiting is a physical attempt to obtain sensitive information from a victim by leaving USB drives in the parking lot, bathrooms and other locations around the target. The attacker will label these devices with names like Salary Records, Photos and other captivating names in the hopes that someone will plug the device into their workstation. Once the victim plugs the device into their computer, an attacker will now have a foothold inside the network.\nImpersonation\nSocial Engineers will go to great lengths to impersonate employees. Often they will monitor employees from a distance while gathering photo evidence that will allow them to construct fake employee IDs. Once they have created the ID they will attempt to walk near an employee with devices that allow them to clone their ID card. Once the attacker has cloned the card they can now enter the building without raising too much suspicion.\n\nImpersonation – Cloning RFID cards\nSmokers are one of my favorite targets while Social Engineering. Often these employees are frustrated and looking for a quick break from the stress of the day. Sometimes just having a lighter in your pocket or an extra cigarette is all you need to strike up a conversation. Other times it’s just relating to their frustration and using Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to create a bond while having a smoke. By mirroring the target’s body language, breathing rate, voice and vocabulary, I can begin to build a connection on a subconscious level. This will often throw my target off and they will allow me to walk into the building behind them without a badge.\nThere are ways to improve your protection from these attacks though. Companies should be constantly reviewing their exposure to Social Engineers by identifying where, when and why you could become a victim and how sensitive information should be handled. One of the most important things you can do is to start a training program and create awareness around Social Engineering. At the end of the day, your employees are the weakest link when facing Social Engineers. Establishing security policies and constantly testing your employees can go a long way, but this can be tricky. You do not want to shame your employee for failing a test. The best thing you can do is treat each failure as a teachable moment and allow the employee to recognize and correct their own mistake.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (188, 'HTTP/2 is Here â What Now?', 'Prakash Sinha', '2016-11-16', 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used primarily for communication between the userâs browser and the websites that users are accessing. Introduced in 1991, with a major revision in 1999 to HTTP 1.1, HTTP protocol has many limitations. In 2009, engineers at Google redesigned the protocol in a research project called SPDY (pronounced âspeedyâ) to address some of HTTP 1.1 limitations.\nWebsites in the early 90âs when HTTP was introduced were markedly different from todayâs websites. In February 2015 the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduced a new version, HTTP/2, to keep up with the evolution that internet has undergone since the early 90âs.\n\n \nHTTP/2 introduces a binary layer into HTTP. No change in HTTP semantics is required, which is important to maintain compatibility. HTTP/2 also introduces a variety of enhancements to remove the limitations of HTTP 1.1 and enable it to handle it the newer types of content efficiently. Â A few of the major enhancements of HTTP/2 over HTTP 1.1 are listed below:\n\nTransaction Multiplexing: HTTP 1.1 allowed the clients to send only one request per TCP connection at a time. The subsequent request could only be sent after receiving a reply for the first one from the server. With HTTP/2 the client can now send interleaved requests on the same connection, out-of-order, without waiting for the responses for the earlier requests, thus making the communication much more efficient. This leads to much quicker page load on the client.\nSession Efficiency: When requesting web pages, the client is required to provide session information such as encoding, cache control, user and server identification, cookies, etc. This information is repeated for every HTTP transaction, adding to processing delays and increased page load time. HTTP/2 introduces a new header compression to reduce the payload. In addition, with HTTP/2, itâs enough to send the full header only once per page, and not per transaction. This results in significantly faster web page load time.\nBi-directional Communication and Server Push: With HTTP 1.1, requests could only be initiated by the client, therefore the server could only send resources to the client, after the client had requested them. Â With HTTP/2, the server can initiate pushing resources to the client. This bi-directional communication can reduce the number of transactions and use the available bandwidth much more efficiently, leading to faster web application response times.\n\n [You might also like: Shadow IT: Security and DR Concerns?]\nSo should you adopt HTTP/2?\nHTTP/2 is an important upgrade that can significantly reduce latency for users accessing web applications through transaction multiplexing and server push; reduce bandwidth required to support the same number of users accessing a website through better header compression and reduce the load on the servers due to fewer requests. This means that web applications will have faster response times and serve your users better. Any website where the user interaction is very sensitive to application latency will benefit from a move to HTTP/2.\nAre you ready to move to HTTP/2?\nHTTP/2 is backward compatible with HTTP 1.1, so you could ignore it completely and everything will continue to work as before, but your users surely are ready to move! Most major browsers (Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, Safari, and Edge) added HTTP/2 support by the end of 2015. While encrypted web communication for HTTP/2 is not mandated, all browser implementation of HTTP/2 require HTTPS connection. So, even when a website uses encrypted HTTPS communication, efficiently handling SSL should be one of the key areas to focus on, before enabling HTTP/2.\nAlthough the majority of browsers already support for HTTP/2, many web server platforms donât offer HTTP/2 support yet. One of the capabilities that HTTP/2 added to improve performance is bi-directional communication with server push. With server push, the server pushes resources to the client, before the client requests them specifically. To take advantage of this capability, the server needs the ability to determine which resources to push. Understanding which objects to push before the user asks for them, ensuring those objects donât already exist in the browsersâ cache (otherwise â it will make the transaction slower not faster), is a capability no web servers natively have today.\nHow long will it take for the adoption?\nHTTP 1.1 remains the most deployed HTTP version by far, but HTTP/2 adoption is picking up steam. However, if the past is any predictor, itâll be a very long time before all applications are modified to support HTTP/2. Unlike the past though, as the cloud-based applications proliferate, and the cloud service providers start supporting HTTP/2, the server side of HTTP/2 will gain accelerated adoption. The figure below from HTTP/2 Dashboard provides a snapshot of HTTP/2 adoption timeline thus far.\n\nHow to transition to HTTP/2?\nMany Application Delivery Controllers (ADC) provide HTTP/2 gateway functionality enabling protocol translation from HTTP/2 on the client to HTTP 1.1 on the server side, and vice versa. Using such a solution ensures an interim move to support HTTP/2 on the front-end.\n\nTo support HTTP/2 Server Push without having to rewrite applications to HTTP/2, take advantage of web performance optimization (WPO) techniques and algorithms to determine which objects to push to the client â helping to enable the new server push capability the HTTP/2 protocol offers. This added value offered by the ADC gateway is something that can add significant acceleration to your website and ease your transition so your website users can start experiencing the benefits of this enhanced protocol.\nFor more details: Fastest Website Acceleration for New HTTP Protocol\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'load balancing\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2016/11/http2-is-here/');

The closure no doubt cost Wanamakerâs dozens of dollars.\n\nAs we all know, this isnât a circumstance unique to Wanamakerâs, spikes in demand for calico, or even with physical stores during the holiday shopping rush. The stories of retailers struggling with maintaining web site and application availability during the all-important Black Friday or Cyber Monday shopping blitz have become something of an annual rite. And itâs fair to say that the stakes are much higher than those imparted upon Wanamakerâs in 1890. According to ComScore, last yearâs Cyber Monday sales reached over $3 billion dollars, and were nearly $30 billion during the month of November. The Ponemon Institute estimates a minute of downtime costs organizations over $20,000, but if you consider the concentration of sales during this peak shopping period it is fair to estimate its orders of magnitude higher during Cyber Monday.\n\nFor instance, in 2014 retailer Best Buy suffered a multi-hour outage on Black Friday, reportedly the result of a spike in traffic generated by mobile devices. Based on the limited information available itâs impossible to say whether this downtime was the result of a wave of legitimate customers or malicious traffic resulting from a cyber security attack.\nWhat we can say with certainty is that the last few weeks have given us all very real and alarming examples about the availability of compromised devices that can launch attacks, bringing some of the largest networks and operators to their knees.\nRecent DDoS attacks are proving just how challenging it is to be 100% sure youâre fully protected from todayâs attacks. But the advancement of threats such as DDoS shouldnât be viewed as an excuse to not prepare as much as possible. Itâs an unfortunate situation when IT and security professionals reach a point where they conclude that their only defense is to hope they donât get attacked. As they say, âhope is not a strategy.â\nThe good news is there are some steps you can take to ensure your security operation has factored in the recent evolution of attacks.\n [You might also like: Why Online Retailers Should Be On High Alert for Cyber-Attacks]\nAn obvious but not so easy to accomplish step is having the ability to effectively differentiate between good and bad traffic. Iâll use an analogy here, drawing a parallel between types of traffic and segments of customers. Suppose you have a restaurant that caters to different demographics at different times during the day. During the daytime, your typical customer is the middle-aged, stay-at-home mother or the business person out for a quick lunch. Then in the evenings your customer base turns decidedly younger, the groups of teenagers mulling about town or younger kids with their parents after a little league baseball game. These patterns in customers to your restaurant are your baseline for traffic, the normal behaviors exhibited by your collective customer base.\nThe same principle applies when talking about using behavioral analysis to detect anomalous network or application traffic (including potential attacks). When a traffic type (say a SYN) becomes an unusual or anomalous percentage of the overall traffic, behavioral engines kick in. If at the same time, the overall rate of SYN traffic increases beyond normal rates, then advanced security solutions will determine it to be an attack and block this unusual behavior.\nSo back to the restaurant analogy. If during the middle of the day you saw an unusual percentage of customers in the younger demographic, youâd likely take notice. If the volume of these customers became very large, potentially to the point of exhausting necessary resources (say, mac-and-cheese for the youngsters) then youâd likely take a mitigating action.\nUnfortunately, not all types of attacks against applications or websites are detectable in this manner. DDoS attacks are, but more advanced attacks that donât throw off traffic patterns but do include malicious scripts attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in application code require a different type of protection. Many of these types of attacks are documented by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and are generally the domain of Web Application Firewalls (WAF) for protection. WAFs, like any security technology, vary in capabilities and approach, and of late weâve found many attacks exploiting the reliance some put on the IP address as the means of attack source identification. Fortunately, advanced WAFs are using device fingerprints, a rapidly growing technology that employs various tools and methodologies to gather IP-agnostic information about the source, including running a JavaScript on the client side. The device fingerprint uniquely identifies a web tool entity by combining sometimes dozens of attributes of a userâs device to identify and then track their activities, generating a behavioral and reputational profile of the user. Identification of their behavior as anomalous, potentially malicious can be tracked over time to define a degree of risk to the device.\nWhy is all of this so important now? When you consider the high percentage of bot-generated traffic (over 50% by most estimated), it is clear that organizations need more advancements in botnet (malicious or otherwise) identification. Most of the major security threats such as application DDoS, brute force, SQL injection are executed at least in part through botnets. Add to that the unnecessary and unproductive burden these botnets put onto transactional processing capacity and a very rich ROI can be defined for more successful and precise bot detection and blocking.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Black Friday\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Cyber-Monday\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'ecommerce\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/cyber-attack-season/');

While the bandwidth numbers are impressive indeed, the numbers themselves were expected. The DDoS security experts expect the previous record (about 450G bps) will be broken soon. This 1 Terabyte throughput record will probably be broken again by the end of this year, or early in the next one. The amazing part of the latest attack was the fact that this was not the reflective attack the DDoS world got used to, which leverages large internet servers amplifying the attacker requests. This time, the attack consisted of many semi-legit HTTP get requests. Such layer 7 attacks, which are aimed at the internet pipe as well as the application server behind it, are much harder to block than a layer 3 and layer 4 attack. Such attacks are also much harder to conduct.\n\nA lot was already published about the IoT nature of these attacks and the large bot-net that was used to conduct it. In this post I will speak about the other side – why is it so hard to protect against these layer 7 attacks?\n\nA good mitigation technology has to distinguish between legitimate traffic and a malicious attack. The mitigator needs to allow the legitimate traffic to pass through, while dropping the attack traffic and not letting it hit the application server. There are several techniques to block attacks automatically – responding to the request to verify correct network behavior from the source, identifying repeating patterns in the traffic headers or a rate limit based on traffic parameters. To demonstrate the application layer mitigation and to show the difference in mitigation complexity between layer 3 and layer 4 network attacks and layer 7 HTTP application attacks, let’s look at these techniques one by one.\n [You might also like: DNS and DNS Attacks]\n\nThe request response technique, also known as challenges, is often used to block attacks. On the network layer, when a “syn” packet is received from a source IP, the mitigator can respond with a quick “syn-ack” response, and verify the “ack” response back. Only once a valid “ack” response is received is the session allowed through. However, on the application-based attack, the attacker device will answer such “syn-ack” challenge with a valid “ack” packet. If the mitigator wants to continue with this technique it will need more CPU power, this time to create a valid HTTP packet with a valid HTTP response that will result in session continuation (usually a redirect-to-self request). This layer 7 challenge can indeed be used to block attacks, but as described above, it requires a lot more complexity in code and more CPU cycles. Having said that, it’s important to know that such techniques can usually block application attacks, and a proper DDoS mitigator needs to have it in its mitigation arsenal, not relying on only application level challenges.\n\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n\nPattern identification is often used in the DDoS world to block attacks. After all, the attack traffic is generated using some sort of a software that is sending it from multiple locations. This one software usually has something in common which distinguishes it from legit scattered users. In a network-based attack, the mitigator should create a signature of repeating patterns. Good mitigators can even create such patterns automatically without manual intervention – such automation also saves time for fast mitigation. On network layer mitigation, the pattern will match the layer 3 or layer 4 headers. These headers are easy to parse using software, and the options to search are limited – the headers are well formed and each field has a limited value range. Going into the HTTP layer is much more complicated – the HTTP headers are more loosely defined, and the values (in most cases text) have variable ranges and length. Finding a pattern in the HTTP is possible, but as before – much more complex. The application first needs to parse the packet to get to the layer 7 part, then parse the various parts of the HTTP headers and data and then find the repeated pattern. Even once the pattern is found, it’s much harder to block – the mitigation action should parse each packet’s layer 3, layer 4 and layer 7 data to get to the right place where the pattern is hiding. Again, more code and CPU cycles are needed to block the attack.\n\n\nRate limiting, while a valid mitigation technique, is one that should be considered a last resort in the DDoS world. The main problem with rate limiting is the lack of ability to distinguish between legitimate and attack traffic. When the rate limit is in action, it does not know which packets come from a human being or a bot, as it’s blindly blocking based on rate alone. However, in some cases, rate-limit is the only way to block the attack and protect the service infrastructure from going down. Even rate limit is harder in the application layer – rate limiting packets is not enough since you do want to allow legitimate users to pass though – you should rate limit the HTTP request. Here again, the mitigator needs to parse and understand if this is indeed an HTTP packet. The data is seen only after the TCP 3-way handshake is done, and in many cases the session is already opened to the server.\n\nTo summarize, we see that any known mitigation technology has to perform harder in order to block an application-based attack. Since application-based attacks are already part of our life, and will continue to grow and get more sophisticated, it is important to find a good mitigator that can actually block them, and will keep up with the attackers constantly developing methods.\n\n\nRead “Creating a Safe Environment for Under-Protected APIs” to learn more. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'layer 7\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/layer-7-attack-mitigation/');

You couldnât ignore them as everybody had something to say â speculation on who the attackers were, their motivation, the attack vectors and the traffic volumes. In this blog post, we would like to put an end to the speculation, and discuss facts.\n\nOne of our customers â a global DNS provider â reported fluctuations of 70 to 180 Gbps GRE flood attack mitigated by Radwareâs DDoS protection. In analyzing the attack traffic, we identified a bot sending GRE traffic with encapsulated UDP packets which contained 512 bytes of random data. Based on the attack patterns, we created a dedicated mitigation for our customers.\nThis screenshot shows the bot sending GRE packets.\n\nWhen Miraiâs source-code became public, our top priority was to validate that the GRE attacks against our customer exist and are identical to the attack within the source code.\nUnderstanding the Malware\nIot devices are attractive targets for hackers for several reasons:\n\nFirst, they usually fall short when it gets to endpoint protection implementation.\nSecond, there are no regulations or standards for a secure use of IoT devices as exists for PCs and servers, for example. Such regulation shall ensure secured configurations and practices such as changing default passwords, and access control restrictions (for instance, disable remote access to administrative ports).\nThird, they operate 24*7 and can be used at any moment.\n\nCommon malware usually takes advantage of zero-day and known exploits to gain control over their target machines. This is usually complex and time consuming. Mirai authors wisely chose to skip the wearing zero-day research and instead attack one of the most insecure areas in the cyber landscape â IoT devices.\nMirai specifically targets devices such as closed-circuit television cameras, routers and DVRâs, taking them over to create a botnet which is later used to launch sophisticated multi-vector DDoS assaults. Mirai scans for potential targets – specifically devices with default manufacturer credentials. Most are hard coded into the device hardware by the manufacturer. Mirai remotely connects to the attacked targets using Telnet and SSH access points which are often left open by default. With a basic dictionary attack, Mirai gains control over its targets using the default credentials.\n [You might also like: How Friday’s Massive DDoS Attack in the U.S. Happened]\n\nFigure 2: A portion of the dictionary content used by the malware\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nNew Dangers Lurking in Mirai Source Code\nThe malwareâs source code was written in C and the code for the command and control server (C&C) was written in Go.\nMirai hosts common attacks such as SYN and ACK floods, as well as introduces new DDoS vectors like GRE IP and Ethernet floods. Mirai also features evasion mechanisms to bypass known security controls and mitigation methods before reaching its target.\n\nFigure 3: Menu of Miraiâs attack vectors\nGRE Flood Attack\nGeneric routing encapsulation (GRE) is a tunneling type protocol developed by Cisco. GRE mainly encapsulates data packets and routes them through the tunnel to a destination network that de-encapsulates the payload packets. Sending many GRE packets with large amount of encapsulated data may lead to resource consumption once the victim will try to de-encapsulate them until exhaustion. The payloadâs elements confirmed that the GRE flood attack we mitigated was generated by the original form of Mirai botnet.\n\nFigure 4: A function creating a GRE packet and including it within a GRE flood attack\nHTTP (Layer 7) flood attack\nHTTP flood consists of seemingly legitimate session-based sets of HTTP GET or POST requests sent to a target web server. These requests are specifically designed to consume a significant amount of the serverâs resources, and therefore can result in a denial-of-service.\nHTTP makes it difficult for network security devices to distinguish between legitimate HTTP traffic and malicious HTTP traffic, and could cause a high number of false-positive detections. Rate-based detection engines are also not successful at detecting HTTP flood attacks, as the traffic volume of HTTP floods may be under detection thresholds. Because of this, it is necessary to use several parameters detection including rate-based and rate-invariant.\nMiraiâs HTTP L7 attackâs strings are encrypted within the source code. Using the encryption key, we were able to decrypt it and continue to review the code.\n\nFigure 5: Encryption of Miraiâs scripts\n\nFigure 6: HTTP flood function\n\nFigure 7: Miraiâs HTTP flood program creates 80MB POST requests\nThe malware is able to recognize DDoS protection solutions and adjust the attack accordingly.\n\nFigure 8: Mirai trying to evade DDoS Protection\nMirai uses common headers and standard user agents to emulate legitimate traffic. This type of attack could be mitigated using an automatically adapting, network behavioral solution that differentiates legitimate user traffic from botnet traffic.\n\nFigure 9: Http headers used by Mirai\nTCP STOMP Attack\nThe classic ACK flood attack with a twist. As simple botnets will be easily blocked by most network security solutions as they send large volumes of ACK packets, Mirai starts with the ACK flood only after gaining a legitimate sequence number by completing the TCP connection process. By receiving a sequence number, Mirai raises the odds of bypassing network security solutions.\nDNS Water Torture Attack\nThe attacker sends a pre-crafted DNS query to the service provider DNS server. The malicious DNS query contains random string concatenated previous to the victimâs domain (For example xxxyyyy.www.VictimDomain.com). The DNS server will attempt to get an answer from the authoritative nameserver over and over with no success. Sending different false strings with the victimsâ domain name will eventually dramatically increase the DNS serverâs CPU utilization making it unreachable.\nEssential DDoS Protection Elements\n\nHybrid DDoS Protection– (on-premise + cloud) â for real-time protection that also addresses high volume attacks and protects from pipe saturation.\nBehavioral-Based Detection– to quickly and accurately identify and block anomalies while allowing legitimate traffic through.\nReal-Time SignatureCreationÂ –Â to promptly protect from unknown threats and 0-day attacks.\nProtect your GRE Tunnels –or have your providers do so by monitoring and probing the traffic that passes through them.\nA cyber-security emergency response plan –that includes a dedicated emergency team of experts.\n\nResearch Contributors: Shai Levy, Namik Binyaminov\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/11/insight-into-mirais-source-code/');

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a world where just about anything can be connected and communicate in a âsmart modeâ by combining simple data to produce usable intelligence. With the IoT, the physical world is becoming one big information system with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life and empowering new business models.\nHowever, this also means that more personal information and business data will reside in the cloud and be exchanged between thousands of devices that may have exploitable vulnerabilities. One weak link in the security chain could provide hackers with nearly limitless doorways that could be unlocked and lead to sensitive information.\n\n\nCurrently, more things are connected to the Internet than people. According to Gartner, there are approximately 6.4 billion connected devices in use worldwide in 2016, and that number is slated to reach 20.8 billion by 20201. In this quickly evolving world, all the things that connect to the Internet are exponentially expanding that attack surface for hackers. An HP study shows that 70 percent of IoT devices contain serious vulnerabilities. There is undeniable evidence that our dependence on interconnected technology is defeating our ability to secure it.\nTwo sides to the IoT security coin.\nThe Internet of Things includes a vast and ever-growing array of networked devicesâincluding smart meters used by utilities, medical devices for monitoring patientsâ conditions and delivering care, as well as sensors that do everything from supporting public safety to automating manufacturing processes.\n [You might also like: The Deplorable State of IoT Security]\nWhen it comes to security and the IoT, executives face a two-part dilemma. The first is mitigating the risk of vulnerabilities created or compounded by networked devices. Organizations must consider the possibility of a huge increase in unknown vulnerabilities at the device level, as most lack antivirus or advanced endpoint and threat detection capabilities. While sensors and other IoT devices can fuel exponential improvements in speed, accuracy and efficiency of information collection, they also can make a business vulnerable to intrusions and attacks. Even a companyâs network carrier can be affected if attackers use IoT devices to generate massive spikes in network traffic.\nThe other side of the IoT security dilemma is being protected from devicesâthat is, addressing the risk of the âthingsâ themselves becoming vehicles for an attack. For example, in the past utility customers may have worried that a meter reader would forget to close a back gate, leaving the house un-secure. These days, they want assurance that theyâre not letting a nefarious robot into their homesâputting data privacy and personal safety in jeopardy. On a broader scale, hackers could potentially take control of thousands of smart meters, wreaking havoc on the electrical grid.\nHealthcare is another area where vulnerabilities could be devastating. Imagine a patient receiving an email threatening to alter his or her pacemakerâs performance unless a ransom payment is made. It may sound far-fetched, but healthcare has become a frequent target. Already, numerous attacks have blocked hospitalsâ and other providersâ access to their own data. Networked medical devices provide another potential avenue for such schemes.\nMitigating the threat of âthingsâ.\nRegardless of an organizationâs interests around the IoT, the time has arrived to start taking proactive steps to ensure security. In the end, the full vision of the IoT may or may not come to pass, or it may take longer than some predict. What is undeniable is that connectivity is exploding. While most people may be unaware of how the IoT functions, they will expect it to be secure. Similarly, they will be largely clueless to the potential impact they (and their new gadgets) have on the threat landscape, and thus cannot be relied upon to maintain security capabilities on these devices. As a result, the burden of protecting organizations from the possible wave of new, larger threats falls to the security operations teams.\nâFingerprintingâ devices\nWith the advent of billions of non-traditional IT devices, accurate device identification will simultaneously become more important and more difficult.\nThe primary tool that has long been used for device and user identificationânamely, IP addressesâis rapidly declining in its security value.\nDynamic IP addresses, global Network Address Translation (NAT) and anonymous proxies are just a few of the tools out there that are making the connection of IP address and device or user very hazy.\nOne potential solution is device fingerprintingâa rapidly growing technology that employs various tools and methodologies to gather IP-agnostic information about the source, including running a JavaScript on the client side.

This separation in skill is forcing those with limited knowledge to rely solely on others who are offering paid attack services available in marketplaces on both the Clearnet and Darknet.Â  While most hacktivists still look to enlist a digital army, some are discovering that itâs easier and more time efficient to pay for an attack service like DDoS-as-a-Service. Cyber criminals that are financially motivated market their attack services to these would-be hacktivists looking to take down a target with no knowledge or skill.\n\n\nThis evolution in skill is eliminating the need of the âknow-how,â and one does not have to learn a single thing about computer networks or programming. Attack services have lowered the entry level and kicked off a business trend by commoditizing hacktivist activities. This new trend is resulting in a change in the current hacker community and landscape in regards to skill set and status.\nThe current hacker community can now be categorized and explained in three groups. There is the consumer level, which is strictly composed of non-skilled users who are looking to pay to participate.Â  The second group is the pure hacker.Â  This group is a skilled group that does not require any paid service or assistance to conduct their operations. The third group, vendors, is comprised of hackers who are now looking to commoditize their tools and services due to the growing demand from the consumer level.\nConsumers â The consumer is categorized as a low or non-skilled hacktivist that is looking to pay to participate in an operation. Currently this group represents the largest of the three. This groupâs growth and demand for paid attack services is the main reason why the attack marketplace is growing so rapidly. The consumer group does not know how to carry out an attack on their own, so they rely on attack services that provide an easy-to-use attack portal. Consumers will spend anywhere between $20 – $200 dollars a month in attack services so they can participate in different hacktivist operations.

These vendors are exploiting a digital divide for a profit and return that have been proven to be well worth the risk to most hackers looking to cash in. The owners behind vDoS AppleJ4ck allegedly made $600,000 over two years before getting arrested.\nThe leading contributor to the evolution and change in the classification of the hacker community is due to the growth of the attack marketplace and the commoditization of attack services that have resulted in a skills gap. The profits behind selling tools to entry level consumers has led to the creation of highly popular and easily accessible marketplaces where potential hacktivists with no skill set can purchase a number of attack services that vendors are willing to set up for a fee. These markets have greatly advanced the evolution of hacktivists over the last year but at the same time resulted in a divide in skill set, forcing more to become reliant consumers.\nOver the next year, expect to see more hackers enter the markets as vendors looking to sell their tools and services as the divide between skilled and amateur hacktivist broadens. We also expect to see more consumer hacktivists joining the attack landscape as more attack services become readily available.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Darknet\', \'Hackers\', \'hacktivists\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/profile-of-a-hacker/');

Just to give a few examples: Fridges have been hacked to launch spam campaigns, a connected cars PoC hack and sabotage of brakes, medical insulin pumps vulnerable to hacking, connected toys easily hackable, etc.\nHow did all this happen?\nWell, it all started with the Mirai malware, a malware that targets connected objects by exploiting inherent vulnerabilities, especially the fact that these systems are usually protected by factory default passwords or even hard-coded username/passwords. Once infected with malware, these devices become part of the “botnet army” reporting to a central control server. Rise of the machines indeed!\nThis malware uses a Busybox specific command, which causes the infection to fail if Busybox is not present. This is why the malware is specifically recruiting IoT devices for its botnets. An illustration of how vulnerable IoT devices can be: you can pull 300k bots using telnet (yes telnet :-))\nFor now, the botnet of Iot devices are used to launch DDoS attacks to knock down websites. As the story is still developing, we can expect that other botnets might be used for targeted data theft.\nExperts noted that Mirai infected CCTV cameras, DVRs, smart TV, cellular gateways, etc. Over 1 million devices are infected & have been turned into “bots.”\n [You might also like: How Friday’s Massive DDoS Attack on the U.S. Happened?]\nCurrent info (changing regularly): most infected devices are in the U.S., followed by Brazil & Colombia.\nTo further complicate things, Mirai malware code was made public on Hackforums in early October, and has been seen on Github as well lately. By going open source, anyone can now make a scanner and create his army of IoT devices by infecting vulnerable IoT devices. The source code of Mirai has been copied over 1,000 times until now.\nThere is also another similar malware (Bashlight/Bashlite ) targeting similar IoT vulnerable devices (they already have an army of IoT devices) but not involved yet in massive attacks like what we saw the past month.\nWas this preventable? Definitely, but the Internet of Things revolution did not build on the lessons learned for the IT past experience. Security best practices were not integrated in IoT innovations, mainly because in the race for innovation and shrinking time to market, security was – incorrectly- viewed as a roadblock.\nThe end result is many connected objects with factory default username/passwords, no encryption, no authentication for 2-way communication, using insecure port 23, etc.\nSecuring such connected devices in the aftermath, is much more complicated and costly. Take the example of the connected car PoC hack, companies didn’t know how to patch because no solutions were defined by design to patch remotely and millions of cars were recalled, with patching organized via dispatched USB keys.\nAlthough this type of IoT botnet is no surprise, the repercussions are big\n\nKey websites and internet services were down for a number of hours\nThis could and will slow down the internet (as millions of IoT devices will generate a lot of traffic and take over the bandwidth)\nCurrent number of infected IoT devices = 1,266,702 (figures increasing drastically!)\nWith new, larger & bigger botnets, DDoS attacks are increasing exponentially in size. A year ago, we considered 300 Gbps as a large DDoS attack, at the end of 2015 600 Gbps, and now September 2016, 1Tbps!\nThe malware code behind these attacks has been made public by its creator. Anyone can create his/her own army of botnets and use it for a cyber-criminal agenda\nIn 2016, 5.5 million new “things” are getting  connected each day, according to Gartner. 6.4 billion connected things are expected by end of 2016, reaching 20.8 billion by 2020. If all these devices are insecure by design, we can expect more sophisticated attacks targeting them, with more drastic impacts.\n\nKey attacks recorded with IoT DDoS botnets in the past 2 months\nFriday’s Dyn attack was the result of Mirai malware infected botnets (not the first attack using Mirai infected devices). It started in September by targeting the website of Krebs (a well known security guru) then OVH, a French web hosting company.\n\nKrebsonsecurity website (a security guru website): Attack on 20th of September, peak reached 665 Gpbs, based\nOVH attack: OVH is a French web hosting services provider. Attack launched week of September19th. Peak reached 1Tbps based on 145,000 IoT devices. Mainly CCTV, home routers, raspberry pi, DVR, etc.\nDyn DNS (DNS services provided to websites like Amazon, Spotify, Twitter, Reddit, etc.) suffered the same type of attack on the 21st of October as reported by Flashpoint. Dyn confirmed the information and stated that over 10 million IP addresses were used to flood Dyn’s networks & traffic.\n\nSome might ask, why are hackers using IoT botnets, and not the usual PC botnets? As you can see from the figure above, we have the potential of much larger networks, mainly insecure, easy to infect and usually always on. You turn your PC off, but a CCTV, router, fridge.. these remain on. Which makes the botnets all available for action.\nWhat can we do about it? are we doomed?\nMirai means Future in Japanese.. a good presage of what the future will hold for us?\nCyber-attacks are here to stay. We know that sophisticated stealth attacks will increase and be an undeniable concern for all enterprises. However, some attacks, such as this one, could have been prevented, or at least their impacts lessened, if the all stakeholders adopted more security best practices.\n [You might also like: Are You Ready for a New Age of Attacks?]\nWhat can consumers do?\n\nIt is possible to clean an IoT device by rebooting the system (remember IoT devices have volatile RAM-like memory), but the vulnerable devices will be re-infected within minutes because these botnet scans are running all the time.\nUpgrade when possible.\nSet a strong password (do not keep factory password).\nWhen this is not possible, disconnect from the internet & contact the vendor/manufacturer.\n\nWhat should manufacturers of IoT devices do?\n\nSecurity should not be an option, but the standard way of working. Security experts, if involved in the concept & design phase, will improve security, and set appropriate control mechanisms to facilitate regular security updates & improvement. Nowadays, we cannot have hard-coded passwords or unencrypted communication. This is Security 101.\nWe have seen lately connected insulin pumps with identified vulnerabilities, where the manufacturer decided not to issue any patches.\n\nWhat can ISP do ?\n\nNeed to set up protection against spoofing, as this is exactly what botnets do when they spoof users and issue large volumes of commands to flood the traffic\n\nWhat can DNS service providers do?\n\nImprove security & protection of the services, with distributed infrastructures & smart-caching to allow local DNS Resolution, rate-limiting requests, over-provisioning machine resources, etc.\n\nWatch out! What you see is not only what you get. Some DDoS attack methods, such as smoke-screening, are used to flood your business with the DDoS, while in parallel try to steal sensitive data. Monitor, investigate & detect such pervasive & stealth attacks.\nWe all need to collaborate together to secure every step of the way. As cyber-security experts, we know how hard it is to secure, protect & defend a business. We prepare for the “unknown” because we know that all cyber-attacks are not preventable.\nThis article first appeared on the Author’s LinkedIn page.

As a result, hundreds of thousands of websites became unreachable to most of the world including Amazonâs EC2 instances. This problem intensified later in the day when the attackers launched a second round of attacks against Dynâs DNS system. Dynâs mitigation of the attack can be viewed on RIPEâs website where a video illustrates the BGP switches.\n\n\nAmazon status update from Dyn outage\nDomain Name Servers (DNS) are like the phone books or roadmaps of the internet. These services maintain a directory of domain names and their corresponding IP address. Itâs easier for humans to remember a domain name versus an IP address, so when a user types in Radware.com into their browser they are actually directed to 91.240.147.21.\nResearchers have long warned about the risks of a vast majority of internet clients centralizing their networks by using a handful of DNS providers. Coupled with this problem are a large number of internet clients using only one DNS provider for both their primary and secondary DNS. When DynDNS went under attack, those that did not use redundant DNS services found service unavailable and users unable to reach their website.\nThis is not the first time a DNS service provider has been targeted. On May 16th NS1âs Managed DNS network fell victim to a similar attack. Over the course of the week, NS1 sustained multiple DDoS attacks ranging from simple volumetric attacks to malicious direct DNS queries and malformed packets. This attack was reported to be broadly sourced queries for real customer domains and variations, thus making detection and DDoS mitigation much more difficult.\n [You might also like: At Risk for DDoS Outages? If You Answer Yes to the First Five Questions, Watch Out!]\nA DNS flood is a UDP flood in which an attacker targets one or more DNS resolvers. DNS floods are a symmetrical attack that attempts to exhaust a serverâs resources, memory or CPU, with floods of UDP requests. The attacker sends crafted UDP traffic for name resolution. By sending a massive number of requests to the targeted DNS server, an attacker can consume the serviceâs resources, resulting in service degradation for legitimate requests.\nThese attacks are not targeted at the customers on the network, but the DNS provider themselves. Attackers attempt to exhaust network resources by flooding the DNS providers with junk DNS queries. DNS servers are a roadmap to the internet and help users find the websites they are looking for. When an attacker ties up all of the DNSâs resources, legitimate clients are unable to resolve their request.\nDNS service providers see a massive amount of traffic every day and can easily handle multiple 20-60 Gbps attacks at a time. When attack traffic grows beyond 600Gbps the neighborhood starts to shake, resulting in a resource exhaustion which leads to service degradation. Attacks over 1Tbps pose an even bigger threat. These attacks are so large that some parts of the network infrastructure canât handle the traffic and end up null routing the target to prevent further outages. Internet of Things (IoT) botnets are leading the way into this new unmitigated territory.\nBehind these massive DDoS attacks are infected IoT devices. Both Flashpoint and Level3 were able to identify and confirm that some of the infrastructure used in the denial of service attack against Dyn DNS were botnets associated with the Mirai malware. The Mirai botnet rose to fame during the attacks on Brian Krebs and OVH earlier this month, where attack sizes reached a record breaking 1.1Tbps. Shortly after the attack, a user on HackForums, Anna_Senpai, released the source code for the Mirai botnet. Since then a number of attackers have modified and deployed the botnet for themselves. At the moment, Radware has not been able to locate the Mirai botnet for rent but a quick glance at the Darknet marketplaces and you can find a number of other botnets for rent.\n\nPayPal switches DNS during the Dyn Attack\nMirai botnet and a number of other malware variants targeting IoT devices are leveraging default passwords to infect these devices. Attackers are scanning the internet looking for devices that ship with default credentials that are easily brute-forced. Attackers can quickly enlist over 100,000 devices in just a day due to aggressive scanning, resulting in massive botnets that are always online.\n [You might also like: DNS and DNS Attacks]\n\nEA Support announces issues related to DynDNS\nAttackers are targeting DNS service providers in an attempt to destabilize the internet by targeting DNS, CDNs and other network infrastructure. At the moment itâs unclear who is actually behind the attacks, but one thing is clear, internet clients need to practice better DNS management and egress filtering of port 53.\nMany have already speculated on who is behind the attack, ranging from Russia, China, to Anonymous and Anna_Senpai. With the elections quickly approaching, most are leaning towards the Russians but this does not fit the patterns of a nation state attack. This attack doesnât fit the MO of Anonymous either. Normally Anonymous will announce campaigns ahead of time, giving them a chance to publish their target list and coordinate attacks. Anonymous only opportunistically claimed credit for this attack between the first and second wave, citing payback for Julian Assangeâs internet outage.\nItâs expected that this attacker will continue to test the limits on DNS and the internet infrastructure until the industry addresses and resolves these vulnerabilities related to DNS and IoT security.\nInternet clients could have avoided the outage on the October 21st if they had used a 2nd party for their secondary DNS. Internet clients need to take the time to instill DNS management best practices and actively filter port 53 egress traffic.\n\nRadware has received the DDoS Mitigation Product Line Strategy Leadership Award from Frost & Sullivan.\n\nRead the research to understand how Radwareâs portfolio, with essential network and web security solutions, provides a number of options to at-risk companies.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"How Fridayâs Massive DDoS Attack on the U.S. Happened\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/fridays-massive-ddos-attack-u-s-happened/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Daniel Smith\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/darknet-101.png\",\n        \"height\": 1280,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2016-10-23\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2016-10-23\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'DNS\', \'dns attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/fridays-massive-ddos-attack-u-s-happened/');

Mirai exposes worm-like behavior that spreads to unprotected devices, recruiting them to form massive botnets, leveraging factory default credentials and telnet to brute and compromise unsuspecting user’s devices.\nSoon after the original attacks, Flashpoint released a report identifying the primary manufacturer of the devices utilizing the default credentials ‘root’ and ‘xc3511’. In itself, factory default credentials should not pose an enormous threat, however combined with services like Telnet or SSH enabled by default and the root password being immutable, the device could be considered a Trojan with a secret backdoor, a secret that now has become public knowledge.\n\nIt is not unusual, given the economy of IoT devices and its pressure on margins, that IoT device manufacturers source their hardware and software from upstream manufacturers. In the case of Mirai, Flashpoint identified such upstream manufacturers for white-labeled DVR, NVR and IP Camera boards and software used by countless downstream manufacturers in their own products.\n\nMost, if not all, of the IoT devices targeted by Mirai run the free software BusyBox that provides stripped-down Unix tools in a single executable file. BusyBox runs in a variety of POSIX environments such as Linux, Android, and FreeBSD providing an excellent and especially cheap (free) choice for command line interfaces on embedded devices with very limited resources.\n [You might also like: BusyBox Botnet Mirai: The Warning We’ve All Been Waiting For?]\nFlashpoint’s research on the BusyBox-based software from upstream manufacturer XiongMai Technologies, located in Hangzhou, China, showed the default root password ‘xc3511’ to be hardcoded and not able to be changed, not through the web GUI nor by the command line. Moreover, the telnet service is enabled by default and hardcoded into /etc/init.d/rcS (the primary boot startup script), which makes it difficult to disable. Both weaknesses combined, users are pretty much unable to mitigate the Mirai threat.\nDuring their investigations, Flashpoint identified an additional security issue on devices running XiongMai Technologies “CMS” or “NetSurveillance” software. There is a trivial web authentication bypass by navigating directly to the /DVR.htm page without prior login on the /Login.htm page.\nFlashpoint filed both vulnerabilities under CVE-2016-1000245 and CVE-2016-1000246 respectively. Altogether Flashpoint estimates over 500,000 devices on public IPs around the world to appear susceptible to the reported vulnerabilities.\nKudos to Flashpoint for uncovering and submitting the CVEs. Hopefully XiongMai will act on them providing downstream manufacturers with instructions and code updates to remediate the weaknesses and mitigate the threat (the sooner the better).

Some of you may have heard about the attacks on Brian Krebs’ security researcher and journalist, as well as the attacks on OVH French hosting company. The attacks are accounting for the world’s largest DDoS attacks ever on record, 620Gbps and 1+Tbps respectively. If you’ve read up on these attacks, you’ll also be familiar with the fact that automated bot armies are being leveraged by booter or stresser services. These services are offered by “entrepreneurs” for a nominal fee to their paying clientele. Booter services are not new to the realm of DDoS. What’s changed over the years is the scale and scope these automation engines are achieving. The services command and control networks have grown in number of pwn’d bots and increased capabilities of advanced and effective attack tactics. The exponential population growth of insecure internet-connected devices has enabled this. The Internet of Things (IoT) aka IP-enabled cameras, printers, TVs, refrigerators, etc. have certainly contributed in part because these devices were not developed with security in mind.\n\nRadware’s security research teams have been tracking the IoT growth and correlating attack data, and as expected, we’ve witnessed a significant uptick in attack automation, complexity, and evasion techniques.   A few of the key indicators we track are the size, duration and multiple attack tactics leveraged.  I suggest a read through our last few ERT reports to gather details around the growing trends.\n\nAutomated attacks are here and they are proving to have tremendously fierce impact. In order to combat the attacks of tomorrow, you need to fight back with automation, today! We need zero minute mitigations and orchestration of the entire attack lifecycle. An agile command and control approach, like Radware’s DefenseFlow, enables multiple source detection/collection inputs and ability to leverage Radware Defense Messaging and 3rd party API integration. Recent public examples include integration with next generation flow tools Kentik and Deepfield.\n\n [You might also like: Are You Ready for a New Age of Attacks?]\nA DDoS attack life cycle can be broken-down into seven simple steps that are all visible to the customer in real-time:\n\nDetection of an attack – The first step in mitigating a DDoS attack is to detect it. When a protected network is under attack, Radware detects the attack and determines if a traffic diversion to the scrubbing center is required.\nDiversion Initiation – The decision to divert can be made automatically by predefined pipe saturation thresholds and security alerts, which are synced from the customer’s on-premise equipment (CPE) via DefenseMessaging, or manually either by the click of a button in the portal, programmatically via API/SDK, or by contacting Radware by phone/email.\nTraffic Diversion – Once a decision to divert the traffic has been made, the traffic is diverted from the local data center to the scrubbing center\nMitigation of attack traffic – Dirty traffic enters the scrubbing center where it encounters full multi-layered protection spanning DDoS attacks on the network and application layers, volumetric and non-volumetric attacks, as well as coverage of SSL-based DDoS attacks.\nReturn of clean traffic to the protected network – While the attack traffic is being cleansed, only the clean legitimate traffic is routed back to the protected network.\nCool-down – When the attack has ended, traffic remains diverted for a period of time. This provides quick protection in case a secondary attack is launched.\nReversion – After the cool down period has ended, and no new attack has been launched, traffic returns to flow in the original peacetime routes; directly to the customer premises.\n\n\nWe are working diligently with others in the internet community toward the better good.   We joined the DOTS (DDoS Open Threat Signaling) working group along with other vendors and operators to assist in developing a standards-based method of communicating between the DDOS mitigation appliances onsite and the Service Provider.   According to the DOTS charter, “The aim of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is to develop a standards-based approach for the real time signaling of DDoS related telemetry and threat handling requests and data between elements concerned with DDoS attack detection, classification, traceback, and mitigation.”  I won’t attempt to go through all the details here but rather point you directly to the source.  On a very basic view, DOTS defines two main entities: DOTS Client and Server where “client” asks “server” for mitigation services in cases of DoS attack.  DOTS’ signaling concept is similar to Radware Defense Messaging.\n\nIn closing, It’s a rough road ahead in the face of the impending bot attacks. What will you do to protect your business from the attacks of tomorrow?  Consider the impact of automation and how your teams will withstand the near constant beating. Maybe you’re in a position to assist? Consider joining the DOTS working group take your part to secure those IoT devices or influence the adoption of BCP 38.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'Hacking\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/automated-attacks-stay/');

Over the past few years this event has continued to build attendance and interest at a brisk pace as they achieved a record high attendance and a wonderful gathering of vendors and practitioners alike. All-in-all, I believe that if one couldnât learn something from the Segurinfo Mexico 2016 show then the problem probably laid more with the seeker than the organizers of this show!\n\n\nHaving said that, I would like to share a few pithy thoughts on my impressions of how information security is progressing in Mexico and Latin America (LATAM) in general now that Iâve had some time for the dust to settle. So, in no particular order:\nItâs clear that security is big business â especially in Mexico: When making the rounds at the show, I was getting the sense that information security controls and safeguarding technology has grown up from a âgeeky-little industryâ that big companies used to just smirk upon, rising to a driving force behind scores of peopleâs lives and, moreover, money. One has come to expect the vendor booths being often âover the topâ with outrageous gimmicks, etc., however this year it was clearly so much more than this, and you really got the feeling of âbig businessesâ at work.\n [You might also like: 5 Recipes For How to Design a Resilient Cyber Attack Environment]\nSDN is NOT a consideration in LATAM today â and even for the biggest Mexican carriers still a distant consideration: From walking around Segurinfo Mexico 2016 I got the impression from the vast majority of exhibitors that most are either unprepared for the coming SDN revolution or ignorant to it. As I rounded the booths, I could find few who understood this technology upheaval or were trying to address it with their technologies.\nCloud Migration & Consumerization of IT is Being Ignored: One striking theme of the vendors who attended is that most are speaking to enterprises. They talk as if enterprises are their audience and enterprise technology environments is where the focus needs to be. For example there was a lot of focus on the data breach that affected Target, and little to the fact governments â especially LATAM governments – and numerous Carriers experienced large scale breaches and outages this year. It seemed to me that in our industry our solutions are not keeping pace with the macro trends that enterprises are migrating their IT to the cloud and are no longer controlling (or will not control any longer) the devices in which their employees access their systems going forward.\nMost security technology does not do mitigation: The other striking situation is how many vendors donât really provide their customers with end-to-end solutions. Almost by definition they provide âdetectionâ and then hand the problem to their customers to solve. Have you ever noticed that MOST security vendors donât remedy the problems they uncover?

Thatâs likely no longer the case after these latest attacks. Itâs a shift I experienced first-hand at the SecureWorld event in Denver where I participated in a panel on the current threat landscape. Suddenly, the IoT threat has more attention in such a setting, whereas in the past it held more merit in the future threats panels and discussions. This weekâs panel elicited a palpable degree of anxiety from the audience about what these attacks mean for security professionals.\n\nHereâs what we know about the attacks . . . the Krebs on Security blog became the target of an attack that started on September 20, peaking at over 620 Gbps of traffic. Some reports speculate that the attack was a retaliatory strike in response to Krebs reporting on some specific information about DDoS-for-hire service providers. Regardless of the motives, the attack was notable not only for its size, but also due to the fact that the botnet that generated the majority of the traffic appears to have been built through exploiting vulnerabilities in roughly 1 million network-enabled cameras, making it the most vivid example of an IoT botnet.\n\nJust a few days later, European based hosting provider OVH was hit with an attack approaching 1 Tbps, making it by far the largest reported DDoS attack ever seen. Â Within a week, the source code behind the botnet (Mirai) was released, confirming the key role that IoT devices played in these attacks.\nWithout question, these attacks signal a new age of attacks that will force many organizations to revisit their current DDoS protection strategies. Based on some of the dynamics of these attacks, here are some things to consider when looking for service providers that are prepared to defend you from this new wave of attacks:\n\n\nLayer 7 attack detection: In the past, most very large scale DDoS attacks have leveraged network attack vectors (Layer 3/4). However, these attacks are reportedly sending through massive amounts of HTTP floods, making most Layer 3/4 attack detection methods (e.g., Netflow analysis) useless. Be sure your service provider has effective application (Layer 7) attack detection and mitigation capabilities.\n\n\n [You might also like: BusyBox Botnet Mirai – The Warning We’ve All Been Waiting For?]\n\nHybrid, automated mitigation capabilities: According to some reports, the recent attacks ramped up with extreme speed, hitting 100 Gbps of attack traffic within 15 seconds. Successfully defending a network from such an attack really requires resources conducting multi-vector attack detection in an always-on fashion, along with an ability to automate the process of redirection of traffic to cloud based mitigation resources. Be sure your provider is utilizing hybrid mitigation capabilities, ideally leveraging same technologies on-premise and in the cloud to ease automation and speed time for effective and accurate mitigation.\nSeparate network for DDoS mitigation: The ideal architecture features a separate, scalable infrastructure specifically for volumetric DDoS attack mitigation where attacks can be rerouted when they reach predetermined thresholds. These DDoS scrubbing centers should ideally be located close to a major Internet peering point, providing the distinct advantage of not having to backhaul large amounts of traffic across a network backbone, which increase costs to the service provider and results in a necessity to drop certain customers who are under sustained volumetric attacks.\nIP agnostic protection: The IP address has a rapidly decreasing value in security, for a wide variety of reasons. First, the reality is that many users access the Internet through providers using dynamic hosting configuration that results in a new IP address each time they access the Internet. When you combine this with the increased mobility of todayâs user, organizations are quickly faced with a challenging situation with regard to user identification. Additionally, users accessing the Internet through Network Address Translation (NAT) devices result in many devices sharing the same IP address, making it difficult to block IPs without potentially blocking legitimate users/devices.\nAbility to quickly scale HW needs: These attacks also highlight the advantage of being a manufacturer of dedicated DDoS mitigation hardware. Security service providers that build their services upon third-party technology will always have a stricter mitigation capacity threshold than those that have additional high-capacity gear on hand and ready for deployment as needed.\n\nFor now, it appears the attacks against Krebs on Security and OVH have ended. However, they should stay in the forefront of the minds of security practitioners as indicative of the direction of large cyber security attacks. And they should also be carefully reviewed by those considering the appropriate DDoS protection strategy and service architecture for their business.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Cyber attack\', \'internet of things\', \'IoT\', \'krebsonsecurity\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/ready-new-age-attacks/');

A few days later, the same type of botnet was used in a 1Tbps attack targeting the French webhoster OVH. Whatâs interesting about these attacks was that compared to previous record-holding attacks, which were less than half the traffic volume, they were not using amplification or reflection. In the case of KrebsOnSecurity, the biggest chunk of the attack traffic came in the form of GRE, which is very unusual. In the OVH attack, more than 140,000 unique IPs were reported in what seemed to be a SYN and ACK flood attack.\n\nSoon after the attacks, a user called anna-senpai posted theÂ source codeÂ and instructions for building the bot and CnC involved in the attacks onÂ hackforums.netÂ and named it Mirai. It would seem that the author of Mirai was also the author of botnet malware Qbot.\n \nThe Mirai bots are self-replicating and use a central service to control the loading and prevent multiple bots being loaded on already harvested devices. Every infected device scans for open telnet ports and performs a brute-force login using 60+ factory default credentials of BusyBox -based Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Once the bot finds a new victim, the victimâs IP and credentials are sent to a centralized ScanListen service, which passes this information to the bot-load service that subsequently loads and starts the bot on the new victim. From that point forward, the new victim will help in harvesting new bots. This self-replicating pattern results in an exponentially growing number of bots in the botnet, reportedly up to 500 brute results per second at peak.\n [You might also like: 5 Ways Hackers Market Their Products and Services]\nThrough research we found that the Mirai code appears professional. The loader and bot are coded in C, while the scanListen and CnC service are written in Go, leveraging go-routines and channels in an efficient CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) design pattern. This distributed micro-service architecture allows for scalable control of bots and executing attacks in very large botnets. It should not be surprising that malware and bots are designed and coded by professionals. The economics of cyber-attacks are well established and covered in a recent blog by Ron Winward.\nThe most concerning fact, and the genius of Mirai, resides in its simplicity for victimizing IoT devices. Simple use of telnet and a limited list of factory default usernames and passwords result in botnets with sizes that thwart our imagination. This makes Mirai one severe warning for IoT vendors and device makers. It also shows that for security, one should not rely on the average user to protect and harden his devices, especially for IoT and smart devices that are starting to invade everyoneâs homes.\nThis warning might be the most severe in its kind, but it was certainly not the first about the security risks from the IoT. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have issued public service announcements about the associated security risks as early as September 2015.\nThese incidents once again demonstrate the need for IoT platforms designed with security in mind from the ground up, not adding security as an afterthought. To date, the number of connected devices is estimated at 6 billion, compared to an estimated internet user count of 3.5 billion. By some sources, the number of connected things will reach 20 billion by the year 2020, of which 13 billion will be in the consumer space.\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Hacking\', \'IoT\', \'Krebs\', \'mirai\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/10/busybox-botnet-mirai/');

(Note: If the “IT Systems or Data” is your business, you can replace the whole question with the more existential and rhetorical question of “Do you care about your business?”)\nIf your answer is “Yes” to even a portion of that question – passwords are necessary. Why?\n\nThe Basic Premise of Passwords\nA password (which may take many forms) is the only way to tell who did what to an IT system/data and when. Repeat – this is the only way.\nAlthough many of my security brethren would disagree, the use of passwords has been passed down from the earliest known passages of mankind and I believe the concept will live in perpetuity, albeit not in the format we’ve come to know and leverage over the past two decades. But first, let’s review the academic purposes of passwords.\nAt the root a password accomplishes a lot of tasks:\n\nIt authenticates a person\nIt authorizes a certain set of tasks, capabilities or access\nIt provides a fundamental ability to audit\nIt should provide for non-repudiation (fancy word to say that someone can prove YOU were the actor behind the proxy credentials)\n\n [You might also like: How Mark Zuckerberg’s LinkedIn, Twitter and Pinterest Accounts Were Compromised]\nA password is generally a secret code or sequence of characters known between a person attempting to access something and the object that is being accessed or the person that is granting the access. It is analogous to a key used to access one’s house or automobile.\nPasswords (or electronic keys if you will) are used in accessing computer operating systems, applications, and data that are known to a person. This person is referred to by IT Departments as “the user”.\nPasswords are generally a result of an authentication system which can be built on one or more of a Four Factor System of establishing a valid user. The academic premise of this Four Factor System is that the more you combine these factors, the more likely you are to have a REAL and authentic user on the other side of the challenge.\nThe Four Access Factors are as follows\n\nChallenge based upon something the person knows (e.g. a Password)\nChallenge based upon something the person has (e.g. Enter a dongle or key into the computer). The common example of this is a house or car key\nChallenge based upon something you are (e.g. this is often biotechnology like a fingerprint or eye-retina scanner)\nChallenge based upon somewhere you are (e.g. only authenticate based upon location, such as must be in New York State or at a certain address, etc.)\n\nIn the financial sector today it is common practice that for someone to access an account with personally identifiable information, they must combine two of the factors listed above for access.\nNext Question: What is your business’ access philosophy?\nSimply Put: Password Management Reflects Business Ethos and Pathos\n\nOur customers/business “Users” will only have access to those systems/data that they need to accomplish their job – and no more. This is often referred to as “need to know.”\nOur customers/“Users” will be given access by their role or job function – something frequently called Role Based Access Control (RBAC), which defines Rules based upon your relationship with the system you interface with. This system, although inherently better to manage than other access systems, may require some users to have more (but frequently not less) access than they need to accomplish their job tasks.\nUsers will be given access by a cultural set of permissions/queries by the user and/or user’s supervisory chain-of-command. This could be as little access as specific applications only and/or as much as access to everything.\n\nThe organization’s access philosophy that is based on “need to know” and “need to perform job function” best supports the password system. Regular reviews of personnel access profiles as well as logical security awareness through education and training are imperative for the maintenance and support of the organization’s access philosophy. While password management is very serious, keep in mind that a password alone will not prevent unauthorized access.\nWhat happens when passwords are not taken seriously within a business/enterprise?\n [You might also like: Fraud on the Darknet: How to Own Over One Million Usernames and Passwords]\nThe bottom line is that the company is setting itself up to be a victim to an act that may have no recourse. In lay terms, should someone exploit the enterprise’s IT systems/data and causes serious problems (this may come in many forms – from financial fraud to sexual harassment, from total enterprise processing outage to regulatory compliance lapses) – if the enterprise can not DEFINITIVELY SAY that the act that was traced to a certain computer was ACTUALLY accessed by a certain person, the enterprise will have little recourse. You see, solid and respectful password management is not only important to an enterprise, but it is also respectful to the employee, ensuring that their identity may not be quick copied and used in a malicious manner.\n\nSo what amounts to some password practices that are considered widely understood and practiced?\n– Do use a different password on each important system. Assume that the administrator for each system can decipher your password for that system; Don’t give them access to all of your accounts. By using different passwords, you limit the damage of a breach to a single account.\n– Don’t give your password to anyone. No one, not even the system administrator, needs your password. If someone asks for your password, assume the worst.\n– Don’t use dictionary words. Webster’s New World College Dictionary has 163,000 words in it. The smallest dictionary in a password cracker has more than 200,000; It includes places and popular names, such as Spock. Do the math.\n– Don’t use personal information. Social security numbers, telephone numbers, date of birth, and the names of kids, pets and significant others should all be considered off-limits.\n– Do use numbers and symbols, and not just at the end. There are several good mnemonics for generating passwords. Use the first letter of each word in a sentence and then randomly capitalize some letters and add numbers and special characters.\nAdditionally – the corporate philosophies that are considered mainstream practice is the following:\n\n“Access based on job function” best supports the password system. This ‘philosophy’ should be stated in a corporate policy.\nTechnical password management is set and updated timely (60 days) in the organization’s systems’ procedures.\nRoutine reviews of compliance are conducted by multiple entities.\nPersonnel are to be educated and trained on password management and provided with supporting documentation.\n\nBottom line: Go-Forward Password Rules for Today’s Online Businesses\nRule #1: Single Factor Passwords Are Dead!\nRule #2: Two-Factor is required for all basic authentication- including system-level\nRule #3: Automate password authentication wherever possible. Don’t rely on people or process\nRule #4: Triple Factor is required for access which is considered “secure”\nRule #5: Assume vendors will let you down. Be demanding, unrelenting\nRule #6: Quadruple factor is required for any information/access where absolute security is required.\nRule #7: Never assume an authenticated person / process is real. It needs to be continuously tested and audited for authenticity.\n\n\n Download the “Cyber Ransom Survival Guide: The Growing Threat of Ransomware and RDoS – and What to Do About It” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'password management\', \'password protection\', \'passwords\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/09/modern-day-password-management/');

Identify security services that overlay a number of different cloud-based apps and provide the same technology and policy management for on-premise applications.\n\nStart with Low Risk Assets\nAs you begin migrating to the cloud, start with data and apps that are less sensitive or mission-critical. CRMs, for example, might not be as sensitive to downtime or data loss. Until you’ve vetted the reliability and security of a cloud service provider, avoid migrating high-risk assets.\nMaintain User Confidentiality\nIf your cloud provider is defending against encrypted attacks, it might inadvertently compromise user confidentiality. After all, detecting encrypted attacks requires some level of decryption of both legitimate and malicious traffic. Check with your cloud provider to see what solutions it uses and whether your sensitive information will stay private.\nKnow What You Have in the Cloud\nYour employees are almost certainly using cloud-based applications without the knowledge of IT teams, leaving a trail of vulnerabilities and data leakage. Unapproved cloud-based apps can lead to malware, posing a risk to the network. This problem has generated a new category in the security space: the cloud access security broker.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nDon’t Become Collateral Damage\nUnderstand the architecture and security offered by your cloud provider. Sharing computing resources/space can result in outages throughout the network, degraded performance, or denied access for users in certain geographies. If you share space with the target of an attack, you could become collateral damage. Can your cloud provider separate attack traffic from clean traffic to prevent attacks on cotenants of a cloud platform?\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation: Which Is Right For Your Organization?]\nUnderstand Compliance Implications\n If encrypted sessions are being terminated in the cloud, make sure your provider’s platform or location fit both internal and industry compliance standards. You may be required to upgrade or modify security protocols to ensure the cloud service complies.\nDetect Where You Can, Mitigate Where You Should\nMonitoring for attacks at your own data center is relatively easy, but cloud adoption means critical assets aren’t as “close” as they use to be. That distance can negatively impact timely detection. Place detection capabilities in front of your cloud-based assets just as you would in your data center. It allows you to assess the attack and determine the appropriate response. For example, turning to cloud scrubbing if it’s a volumetric attack.\n Understand the Security Capabilities of Your Cloud Vendors\nAs with any service category, cloud hosting providers have different strengths and weaknesses. Some differentiate based on price, others on speed, and others on security. Be sure to understand the security capabilities of your provider.\nSeparate Security Requirements from Hosting Requirements\nBe careful to not let business units outside IT take ownership of security. Business units are under a lot of pressure to leverage the cloud to speed time-to-market and reduce costs. Security becomes a secondary consideration. Most of these business teams don’t have the skills or knowledge to assess security requirements.\n\n\nRead “7 Things to Look for in a Cloud Security Service” to learn more about how the expanded portfolio of cloud security services continuously adapts in step with evolving threats and ongoing development of applications.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud Security\', \'Cloud Service\', \'Cyber Security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/09/9-ways-ensure-cloud-security/');

WHY?', 'Ben Zilberman', '2016-9-21', 'Like the old words of wisdom “______ happens” (or simply, incidents occur), this is a fact of life. There are troubles you know you’re going to get into and others which you can’t anticipate. However, you can be prepared for each of them. And it is worth doing so, because when incidents occur we go through several psychological phases that affect our decision-making and ability to cope.\nLet’s discuss a few angles that will help you get a notion of whether you need a cyber-security Emergency Response (ER) plan or not, or evaluate the one you already have in place. We will cover the Incident, the Response and the Team.\n\nWhat is an ‘emergency’?\nA whole discussion can be conducted around whether incidents such as a cyber-attack or an attempt to compromise the network is routine vs. an emergency. These days, there are quite a lot of companies that experience such incidents on a daily – if not hourly – basis.\nSo what is an emergency incident then? Every organization has to draw their own line. How? By conducting a risk assessment audit, and defining what is vital for business continuity and which business procedures are of a lesser significance.\n\nA few examples are a network outage, confidential data leakage, an ecommerce site crash and many other forms of business disruptions. These can be caused by a DDoS attack, a persistent bot, web-based attacks or even a malware that encrypts companies’ workstations or servers (ransomware). What would you do?\n [You might also like: Expectation Management: What Can Vendor Management Systems Do For You?]\nOne of the parameters to take into account is the possible financial impact of an incident. Once a vital operation is under threat, you should go into a crisis mode.\nThe Incident – Crisis Management vs. Routine Management\nAssuming you have put some thought into which incidents you may expect and estimated the potential cost of suffering and handling each, you are now ready to make a clear distinction between what is crucial and what isn’t. Then you know which incidents should be considered “emergency”. Remember, you can’t go business-as-usual when the business isn’t as usual. Handling a crisis requires a different approach than handling a regular operation.\nThere are some universal principles of crisis management which can be easily applied to cyber-security as well. Cyber-attacks hurt the machine capital of an organization, but the human capital can still perform and needs to be prepared and directed to overcome the situation.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nBe ready.\nThe Response – Quick Restoration of vital operations until achieving peace time\nThe response begins by acknowledging that the incident is of an “emergency” type. Here you can get a little support from technology. There are a lot of tools out there available for you to detect and estimate risks, as well as to help you overcome an intrusion or an assault. The problem though is to keep your head above the information flood. How would you know what is important without digging into the logs of every security solution you have? You need to think in advance about how you deal with this complexity. In many countries, the regulators have set a standard for cyber-emergency events, providing you with a structured response plan which you will need to tailor to your organization while detailing resource allocation (normally budget and labor).\n\nI recommend you maintain at least two alternatives – what if Plan A doesn’t restore the service as quick as possible or circumscribe the risk as expected?\nFor each course of action, you need the right experts to play a well-defined roll.\nThe Team – Who? When? What?\nMaintaining expertise in-house is a constant challenge. Natural employee turnover combined with technology evolution keeps companies in an ongoing gap between the knowledge they have and the knowledge they need.\nThe implications for cyber security incident responses are numerous.\n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\nFirst, you may want to have a diverse team of experts who not only know how to analyze an attack, but understand the “big picture” of the business impact as well. Team members of a less-technical background can evaluate business considerations or solve operational bottlenecks, complementary skills.\nSecond, as discussed, the team of security experts should be extremely familiar with the different solutions running in the network, as there can be quite a few.\nThird, a well-practiced team with clear guidelines can easily overcome psychological barriers such as anxiety, and by making rational decisions reduce error rate, maintain focus and conduct a structured investigation.\nAnd last but not least, have the executives calling the shots engaged in the practice and familiarized with a variety of scenarios.\nSummary – here is why you need to have an Emergency Response Plan:\n\nCrisis management is different than routine management and requires a different approach and skills\nImprove decision making under uncertainty and anxiety\nReduce resource consumption during restoration – of labor, capital and time\nGet back to normal operation as quick as possible\nMinimize reputational and revenue losses\n\nNow that we agree, more to come in our next blog – “Guidelines for designing and executing an ER Plan.”\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'crisis management\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'emergency response plan\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/09/emergency-response-plan/');

The 4-year-old site provided attack-for-hire services that helped its customers orchestrate more than 150,000 so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS attacks) designed to take websites offline, and earned approximately $300,000 per year.\nIt is simply frightening that a 14-year-old child can build, maintain and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and amass an estimated $1M after four years of operating a DDoS service before being stopped at the age of 18.\n\nThis is clearly only going to serve as an inspiration to legions of children who have talent and are interested in having high rewards for their employed pursuits. It’s the next step in the hacking-for-hire culture that has emerged over the past decade.  For some time now, we have watched talented child-hackers take down high profile targets and then receive lucrative job offers after they complete their incarceration.  What these two young men have shown us is that it is potentially more lucrative to nurture an entrepreneurial venture as a hacker than the previous pattern of hackers seeking to “build their resume.”\n\nThis story sheds light on one of many DDoS as a service tools that rapidly gain popularity over the last few years.  VDoS is not the only attack-for-hire service out there. Many of the world’s most notorious hackers have developed their own iteration of a for-hire attack website.  Many have learned how to avoid prosecution with extensive Terms of Service agreements that absolve them of personal liability.

I can guarantee you that sometimes you will get one that you like, and other times, well, you know. When I was younger, my mom used to pick up a chocolate and poke through the bottom of it to see what was inside. If she didn’t like it, she would put it back in the box for someone else (read: the kids) to eat.\nManaging security on the network is very similar. There are many different types of attacks and it is important to have security solutions that can manage as many as possible. Some of the attacks are easy to identify and mitigate, while others are less appetizing to deal with. Different attack types need to be detected and mitigated. Like my mom, some attacks are better suited to be identified in one location and mitigated (eaten) in another.\n\n\nChocolate covered peanuts\nSome attacks are easy to identify. These are usually network-based attacks that are designed to DoS and DDoS your network and applications. Advanced and behavior-based detector/mitigators can identify and drop these security threats quickly and efficiently. These solutions can create negative and positive policies based on various identifiable packet and session characteristics such as IP address (source/destination), TCP/UDP port, IP protocol, TTL, and TCP flags. All of this can be done without resorting to looking into the payload and content of the traffic.\nCaramel chew or coconut cream?\nApplication layer attacks are harder to detect and mitigate. They require in depth content inspection to identify. SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and javascript vulnerabilities are just a few examples.\nToday, attacks are encrypted more often than not. The encryption is like a chocolate shell that hides the actual content of the item. Only when exposed can we determine the actual threat vector. This means that it is not a simple matter of looking at the shape or size of the traffic to determine if it is malicious. Someone or something needs to poke through the chocolate shell, so to speak, or decrypt the content to be able to analyze its purpose.\nMom for the network\nApplication delivery controllers (ADC) are like my mom. They are designed to do high performance decryption and re-encryption. When this function is combined with a content inspection engine like a web application firewall (WAF), then the application content of all traffic can be inspected. If the traffic is benign, the ADC can pass the traffic to the application server.\n [You might also like: The Maturing of ADC Technology: Moving Beyond Load Balancing]\nThe ADC is actually better than my mom. Instead of putting the malicious traffic back on the network, the security solution and ADC can block the security threat. Unfortunately, this is resource-intensive and if there is a persistent attack, this can consume valuable application inspection resources. I can imagine my mom knowing what chocolates nobody liked and knowing that they should be thrown away.\nSecret codes in the swirls\nDid you know that with a little research, one does not need to poke into every chocolate to know what kind it is? Each type of chocolate has a specific swirl pattern on top of it. It is no longer necessary to poke into every single chocolate to identify it. The inspection can be done on one chocolate and one only needs to correlate the swirl pattern on the top to be able to pick out all chocolates like it.\n\nIf the ADC and security solution that is doing the application content inspection can create a fingerprint based on the unencrypted aspects of the traffic, then this information can be shared with other security solutions such as the DDoS mitigation solution at the edge of the network. This is called defense messaging. The DDoS mitigation solution can apply this shared fingerprint to its security policies and block all future versions of the same threat. This frees up the ADC resources to continue to inspect the application content for other threats.\nIn today’s world, managing security threats requires multiple technologies and the detection and mitigation of the threats should be two independent functions linked through defense messaging.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'Cyber attack\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2016/09/security-threats-are-like-a-box-of-chocolates/');

Other types of attacks, such as Advanced Persistent Threats or Multi-Layer Attacks, take a long time to defend against or even to detect. By contrast, ransomware and RDoS threats shout, “I’m an attack and I’m right here!” You then have 24 to 48 hours to pay the ransom or suffer the loss. At its root, the concept is hardly novel; blackmail has been around for ages. Today it has morphed into some decidedly modern and malicious varieties:\n\n\nRansomware. A Trojan, worm or other form of malicious software takes an environment hostage by making it unavailable to use unless and until a payment is made. The most common forms totally encrypt the environment and require payment to decrypt. However, there are numerous other tactics being deployed that focus on availability of systems and data.\n\n\nRansom Denial of Service (RDoS). In an RDoS attack, the perpetrators send a letter threatening to attack an organization—rendering its business, operations or capability unavailable—unless a ransom is paid by the deadline. These attacks have grown in number every year since 2010 and typically come in the form of a volumetric distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

The discussion was broad in terms of challenges they faced around cyber security, but it was their response to how they handled DDoS attacks that stuck out more than any part of the meeting. “Oh, we just shut down the servers that are being attacked until the attack subsides,” was their input on DDoS defense strategy. Now, to be fair, this was in the early days of advanced thinking on DDoS defense, and also in the context of a broader climate where the view was if there’s a DDoS attack going on, it might signal an attempt to breach data from the server so best to lose availability than lose data confidentiality.\nTimes have changed since then and most any government agency now has to more evenly balance the availability threats with those targeting data confidentiality or integrity. Indeed, a few recent situations have highlighted the impacts of a loss of availability and the constituent reaction to security strategies that don’t effectively balance staying connected with staying secure.\n\nThe first of these is the recent attacks (depending on whose story you believe) on the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and their online census. First, the outage highlights that any organization that takes for granted that they won’t be attacked is playing right into the hands of adversaries. The loss of public trust driven by the lack of availability of the census website will have far-reaching effects for future efforts of ABS to engage with constituents online. Second, the fact that, according to some reports, the attacks were not significant in terms of traffic volume reflects the changing nature of cyber-attacks. Smarter, stealthy attacks can evade basic traffic rate detection and exhaust most specific resources within the application.\n\nThe second example comes from Singapore, where the government recently announced that employees’ work terminals would no longer be connected to the Internet, in an effort to reduce the risk of cyber security incidents. This is one of the more extreme measures I can recall by a large public organization to combat (avoid) cyber-security risks. The more common approach is to segregate certain systems within a network that access or store highly sensitive data. This process is often referred to as “air gapping” and typically means some systems can only be accessed by certain terminals that have no physical connection to other open networks, such as the Internet. Air gap networks are very common in military networks and utilities environments running SCADA systems, but not necessarily for civilian government entities. As coincidence has it, I recently traveled to Singapore and asked many of those I met their thoughts on this move. Without fail, those I spoke with felt it was a bad move and a hit to general confidence in the government’s approach to IT and technology. Tech is such a central part of Singapore’s growth over the past 20+ years, it is hard for Singaporean citizens to imagine their government taking such an archaic approach.\nThe government sector is also an area we get good insights through our annual Global Application & Network Security Report. Their inputs shed light on current threat priorities and defensive strategies common in the sector.\n [You might also like: Hacktivists Using SQL Injections to Target Government Data]\nThe first thing you realize when you survey government security professionals is that they feel like everyone is targeting them. Most industries hone in on one or two threat actor categories, but the government was the only one where at least 40% of respondents identified each of our categories as a major risk. At the top of their list was, somewhat surprisingly, script kiddies with 61% of respondents putting them as either significant or very significant threat (top 2 box).\nDespite the sense of being broadly targeted, inputs suggest that confidence is high in terms of preparation from most cyber-attacks. Around 60% of the respondents said they are confident or very confident of their current defenses against 6 of 9 threat categories we listed. The highest confidence level is on DDoS, with nearly 70% saying they are confident/very confident (highest of all industries surveyed). Their lowest confidence level is around protection of Intellectual Property from theft (only 30% indicated very confident). This could be more of a reflection of the lower priority due to less of a focus on IP development and protection.\nBeing confident in defenses doesn’t mean the government security respondents don’t fear attacks, some more so than others. The attack this group says can do the most harm is unauthorized access, followed closely behind by DDoS attacks and then Advanced Persistent Threats. It was somewhat surprising to me that APT wasn’t #1 given the high profile incidents, though it’s likely some selected unauthorized access as the end result of an APT attack.\nSo a bit past the midway point of 2016, we can see cyber-security attacks against government agencies around the world continue to have significant impact. Despite a concerted focus and recognition of the threats, and in most cases ample investment to provide protection, attacks disrupt operations, erode citizen confidence, and even point to a broader vulnerability that could be exploited by nation-state actors. As we approach the 2016 Presidential Election, it’s a safe bet that cyber-security issues will once again creep into the broader consciousness in the United States as both a legitimate issue and a tool for political banter.\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'government\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/09/government-attitudes-and-strategies-on-cyber-security/');

As the author mentions, a traditional Web Application Firewall (WAF) environment might need to permit and establish the connections before taking an action.  Add this with several thousand flows and source IPs, and you might easily overwhelm a single firewall or WAF.  Finally, certainly not everyone has 10G or higher Internet links, so if you fill the capacity of your link, an HTTP attack like this would be nearly impossible for an upstream Internet provider to block on their routers (they, too, would need a mitigation solution like what weâre discussing).\nNot All Hybrids Are the Same\nAn HTTP POST attack targets the web server and some surrounding infrastructure like WAF, firewall, etc.  At Radware, we recommend a holistic approach to network security.  We make great WAFs, but in this sort of attack, weâd recommend using a perimeter protection like our DefensePro platforms and combining that with our cloud mitigation if needed.\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation: Which is Right for Your Organization?]\nDefensePro has the ability to detect the anomalous traffic and begin to challenge it for legitimacy.  There are several escalations for challenge, so if an attacker can pass the first challenge and the anomaly persists, DefensePro would issue more complex challenges as needed to determine legitimacy.  By inspecting and blocking at the perimeter, you can remove the load and risk from your infrastructure and WAF.\n\nThis is just one aspect of the solution, though.  Radware is proud to be the only hybrid managed security provider who uses the same equipment on premise as we do in our clouds while maintaining them ourselves.  We use our own DefensePro and AppWall appliances in our cloud nodes, so if customers need to divert to the cloud, the move is easy.\nBy owning the cloud mitigation nodes, we have full control and transference from premise to the cloud.  Whatâs more is that we can signal attack and peacetime attributes from the premise to the cloud so that there is no learning needed in the cloud, allowing us to begin accurate mitigation instantly.\n\nThis model also enhances the end userâs experience because cloud diversion (and thus added latency) doesnât need to happen unless there is a threat to the local network.  For example, if you have 2x10G uplinks to your colocation or internet provider and a DefensePro that can support this capacity, you may not want to divert this attack because you can certainly handle it locally.\nIf you did have smaller internet capacity, the hybrid model is still effective.  By using a smaller DefensePro at the perimeter, you still have the advantage of knowing peacetime traffic profiles and can still signal the attack footprint to the Radware cloud.  By doing so, youâre saving costs on unused internet capacity, infrastructure and port costs, and the size of the necessary mitigation equipment.\nWhat About Intelligent Headless Browsers?\nMany smart bots are aware of HTTP challenge techniques like redirects and JavaScript, which is why weâve developed an escalation method in our challenge hierarchy.  To date there are no known instances where a headless browser has defeated some of our more complex HTTP challenges, but weâre constantly enhancing the toolset to stay ahead of the threat.\n [You might also like: Best Practices for Hybrid Cloud/On-Premise Attack Mitigation]\nThe Right Hybrid Model Is Exactly What You Need\nChoosing a security partner can be difficult because thereâs a lot of information to consider.  At Radware, we listen to our customerâs needs and help design the best possible solution for them.  Some of our customers are premise-only.  Some are cloud-only and some are hybrid.  Our goal is to be an innovative partner and build long-lasting relationships with our customers.  As we all know, thereâs not one single security strategy that fits every need.  When evaluating your partner, remember that some of us see things differently than others and not all solutions are the same.\nFor more information on Radwareâs hybrid solutions, check out the following video:\n\n\n\nDownloadÂ Radware’s DDoS Handbook to getÂ expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'hybrid mitigation\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/hybrid-mitigation-in-complex-attacks/');

Multiple locations, countless access points and very motivated attackers all contribute to the complex task of network protection.  As cyber-attacks become more automated and more sophisticated, the adaptability of security professionals is paramount.\n\nADAPTING TO AUTOMATION – WITH AUTOMATION\nA network environment and all of its branches need to detect threats with high quality in one location and then react in all operating environments.  Changes to the affected systems then must be orchestrated quickly and universally. So given these circumstances and what’s on the line, what does the perfect security model look like?\nWhile I can’t opine definitively on which vendor or tactic is best, I have seen the future information security.  Network defenses will continue to succumb to the endless barrage of complex attacks and the immeasurable onslaught of new techniques because we can’t keep up.  Manual defenses can’t keep up.\nThe notion of humans deploying detection technologies and choreographed responses like attack mitigation in real time will fall away – because it has to.  Human interaction with cyber defense will be better seen for what it currently is, imperfect and unreliable, in the face of attacks that are largely automated and mostly reliable, if not perfect.\nThe fall of human cyber-defenses will be replaced with the security bots of the future.  Okay, perhaps this is an overstatement, because I do have several caveats.  I don’t mean the design, the caretaking, or the break-fix of information security will permanently go away, but much of the activities of current security professionals will be overcome by automation.\n [You might also like: 4 Reasons to Believe Future Cyber Attacks Will Terrorize]\n\nARE CYBER-BOT DEFENSES THE ANSWER?\nMany of the operational and critical functions of information security as we know them today will be replaced by bots because of the value they deliver.  Functions like network and application security, compliance, cyber-attack mitigation, incident response and disaster recovery will no longer be a human task.\nA version of this switch to automation has already started in several industries and the technology will exist.  Look at stock and equity trading.  There are no more people at the NYSE doing trades, because they are too slow, too inaccurate, too emotional and too unpredictable. Bots are also increasingly being used to conduct legal research, to test drugs and even to write blogs.\nSHOULD YOU AUTOMATE?\nIf something is more affordable and perhaps more effective, generally an organization’s preference is to automate – whether that be a computer, a process or a bot.  So, what areas are most ripe for quick replacement by bots? Well, that is anyone’s guess but companies are searching all over the startup world for automated solutions to the following security problems:\n\nCompliance: The days of spreadsheets and attestations give way to portals and self-reporting.\n\n\nSecurity Vulnerability Testing:  Vulnerability assessments will not need to be as heavy handed and personalized. These activities cannot only more be automated, but conducted more frequently with better results.\n\n\nIncident Response: Today, these processes are wrought with the latency of human interaction. They are vulnerable to fast moving attacks which take advantage of the human decision making loop – this is too slow to keep up with automated attacks.\n\n\nGovernance: We can picture a day whereby corporate policies are fed into tools which constantly monitor the work environment for violations in an automated fashion\n\n\nSecurity Operations: There is decreasing value associated with people watch detection technology.  These roles will find themselves integrated into automation and orchestration software programs which can quickly and automatically react to attacks.\n\n [You might also like: Why Visibility and Automation Matter]\nTHE FUTURE IS BRIGHT\nThe future of security is not bleak for the security professional who understands how to put in place this automation and orchestrate and fix white-hat bot problems.  However, if you are security “wrench-turner” your wrenches are soon to be pixelated.  As costs rise and concerns meet a crescendo, business executives are being met with new technologies designed to handle threats in an ever-increasing automated fashion.\nAutomated ‘white-hat’ bots will slowly ebb the tide of hiring security professionals.  If you strive to excel in the world of modern networks, the faster you migrate to a high quality, agile detection and mitigation environment which can be customized and self-healed, the better for your continued success.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'automation\', \'cyber bot\', \'cybersecurity\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/newsrooms-and-automation/');

Unfortunately, malicious actors understand this and target online businesses with this in mind. By and large, their efforts are successful. According to Radware’s 2016 Global Network and Application Security Report, 62% of those attacked suffered downtime or degradation. According to this same report, organizations now see more tangible financial impact from cyber-attacks. Over two-thirds (69%) of organizations say attacks cause revenue, customer, partner, and productivity loss (up from 45% last year).\nAttacks aren’t just about outages or breaches, performance degradation caused by attacks are a growing problem as well. According to recent studies, 40% of customers will now wait 3 seconds or less before moving on to a competitor site, meaning the impact of performance loss is extremely tangible for online businesses.\n\nAs cyber threats continue to grow in size, they not only pose security risks but create unnecessary costs that go into processing unwanted data. Processing bad traffic into data centers or cloud hosting environments can result in significant cost, especially to online businesses with largescale networks. Conversely, dropping malicious activity at the border can avoid these unnecessary operational costs and improve overall operational efficiencies. By building strong security controls at all levels of the infrastructure, security teams can provide tools for infrastructure and operations teams to process only legitimate traffic while ensuring that your data center investments are solely for business-related traffic.\n\nHere are four important steps that can help online businesses focus on the threats most commonly targeting these industries.\nAddress the Availability Threat\nFor online businesses, downtime means lost revenue and productivity, making it critical to protect against availability threats, such as DDoS. By and large, there is no longer any debate over the ideal security architecture for providing protection from the wide array of threat vectors related to denial of service attacks. Leading analysts agree that the best solution is hybrid attack protection, a combination of on premise and cloud-based mitigation technology that delivers immediate mitigation of non-volumetric attacks with the availability of additional mitigation resources in the event an attack threatens to saturate the internet pipe of the attack victim.\n [You might also like: Your Risk Checklist to Protect Against Online Business Cybersecurity Threats]\nGuard Against Advanced Bots\nAny business that conducts a high volume of online transactions can be a target of bots that exhaust application resources, illegitimately scrape sensitive information from websites and seek vulnerabilities by abusing application logic. To protect applications from advanced bots, operators need more advanced technologies that can track and precisely detect malicious end-user devices regardless of the source IP address. Device fingerprinting generally uses dozens of device characteristics in a unique way to identify and distinguish it from all others. Using this proprietary tracking, a company can generate device reputational profiles that include historical behavioral information to aid in the detection and mitigation of threats.\nProtect Customers from Fraud\nProtecting online business platforms from fraudulent activity has short-term and long-term benefits in terms of transactions and customer retention. Since many attacks that lead to transactional fraud target application logic vulnerabilities, advanced web application firewall (WAF) technologies should be a critical part of protection strategies. In looking for a WAF that can address more advanced threats, ensure they provide full protection from the OWASP Top 10 threats, use positive and negative security models to keep up with quickly evolving attacks, and minimize manual policy tuning through automation.\nPlan for Migration to the Cloud\nIf your organization hasn’t already started to shift its IT and application environment to the cloud, chances are it soon will. According to recent studies, over 88% of enterprises are leveraging public cloud resources. While the benefits are obvious, sometimes the security implications are not. Adoption of cloud (both public and private clouds) creates distributed network and application environments that complicate management and orchestration of security policies. Additionally, reliance on a variety of cloud hosting providers creates inconsistency of levels of security being provided to various applications. By leveraging technologies that deliver coordinated policy management across hybrid environments and establish a strong baseline of protection, organizations can progress down the path of cloud migration without compromising their security posture.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cloud migration\', \'cybersecurity\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'online business\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/securing-online-assets-four-steps-to-protect-your-online-business/');

There is a perception that this event would be an isolated incident that cripples society as we know it – heck, there is even a TV show about it. But what are the possibilities for such an occurrence in reality? Let’s take a look at three realistic categories where cyber terrorism is either already upon us or having its comeuppance. \nLet’s look at four attack profiles which would reasonably either lead to loss of life or have the potential to leave the victim inevitably stricken with fear:\n\nPUBLIC SCENARIO ONE: Large Scale Communications or Power Outage especially during a Terrorist or Natural Crisis Event\nWe’ve known for quite some time that cutting off communications during crisis periods will impede first responders’ situational awareness, exacerbate suffering and pain and might increase the loss of life. This means that the Pearl Harbor event of our time could consist of multiple components, including a physical attack, with a corresponding cyberattack component that targets the communications systems first responders use to contain and minimize damage.\nThese days it seems like not a day goes by without a widely reported terrorist attack of some sort, but can the day be far away where efforts such as these are magnified by an effective outage on communications or first responders? Think this is crazy? Look at this bulletin issued in 2013 by public safety organizations asking for assistance in cracking a Telephony Denial-of-Service (TDOS) attack against 911 systems.\n\nPUBLIC SCENARIO TWO: Cyber Attacks against Public Transportation Systems\nWe all inherently understand that from trains, planes, buses to automobiles, our entire public transportation system is becoming more automated. Ironically, this automation is meant to provide us with increased safety, more reliable service and efficiencies. But is it really providing those things? If you have been following the public transportation system cyber security threats as close as I have, you’d realize that there have already been many attacks, some of which have distinguished themselves as harbingers of future attacks categories. In case you missed it, I have pointed out four real world examples in a recent blog of mine which help punctuate through example the problem.\n [You might also like: Aviation Accidents: Many Risks Move from Mechanical Failures to Terrorism. Are Cyber-Attacks Next?]\nNot only are the basic forms of transportation under more and more threats, so is the perilous aviation industry, which was so highly correlated to September 11th. Aviation terror threats, like water, tend to take the path of least resistance. We now know through numerous external analysis and documented evidence that the aviation sector is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. How long will it be before the terror strikes will evolve in the aviation industry, like they did around the world, to the cyber front? Should you have responsibility for any aspect of these areas, please don’t be a bystander. Be proactive about onboarding controls and saving peoples’ lives.\nPERSONAL SCENARIO ONE: Cyber-Ransoming a Critical Healthcare Device or System (IoT Attacks)\nImagine if you will that one day you must wear an implantable healthcare device like a defibrillator to maintain your life. Now imagine that this device is hacked and being held for ransom? Believe it is science fiction? Well, the idea of hacking defibrillators is not, and cyber-ransom is the fastest growing motive and technique in cyber-attacks, so can the marriage of these two issues be far off? For those of you unfamiliar with these risks and U.S. Government-issued warnings in this category, please refer to the FDA’s Advice to Medical Device Manufacturers, a summary of FBI & DHS alerts on Internet of things, and these warnings on Cyber-Ransoming.\nPERSONAL SCENARIO Two: Financial or personalized record loss, record changes or deletions.\nIf we are really honest with ourselves, we live two lives (or more). One life is our flesh and blood and represents the ‘real’ you, and the other lives are our various avatars online, which are required for highly functioning citizenry. These avatars represent our financial, health, education, and more often than not, even our love interests (and many more categories).\nThe question resides, who is the definitive source of who we are?\nNow before you answer this question, let me ask you this – – if you are on a job interview and your answer to a question says one thing about your education history and a report back from your institution says another, who rules the day? I think we can take this analogy quite far, but the reality is that your online avatar has actually transcended to represent and require high security and fidelity in order for you to function properly in society.\n [You might also like: Cyber Security in the Real World: 4 Examples of the Rise of Public Transportation Threats]\nGiven this, the fact remains that one of the single most personalized terrorized acts which can occur is for a wide-scale record loss, alteration or deletion to occur with no reconstitution capability. This should strike fear in us all.\nConclusion: Yes, of course Cyberattacks can be terrorizing!\nThe main questions to be asked as we move forward are as follows:\n\nIf physical terror has played such a major role today’s strife, why can’t cybersecurity sabotage be far behind?\nGiven the above current threat landscape, what controls/testing are done to ensure that the public risk is abated through proactive measures, and the private scenarios are regulated so that we can trust our internet avatar system like we trust our financial system?\n\nGiven the threat landscape evolution and importance of the sanctity and trustworthiness of online systems, I believe this is an area where the government needs to step in and provide something like a Federal Bureau of Cyber Security, separate from the charter of all others, and whose role would be equivalent to the Physical Secret Service in numerous ways. However, its operating space and domain would be one with ghostly characteristics of computer-warfare. The charter of this group would be similar, to defend the citizenry of the land, however the belief is that the execution would need to cover the freedom of press and speech overall.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'DDoS attack\', \'terror\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/4-reasons-future-cyber-attacks-will-terrorize/');

This critical shopping season trails Cyber Monday closely as the most important for online generated revenue for many retailers. According to a recent study by Field Agent, a research firm specializing in retail, nearly two-thirds of U.S. consumers plan to purchase at least some of their BTS goods online. So, naturally this is a time of year that the security teams for major online retailers need to be on high alert, keeping an eye out for any attacks that can disrupt operations or breach sensitive data. It’s also a time they need to worry about malicious actors targeting customers with phishing attacks, even if there’s little they can do directly to prevent them. With average consumers in U.S. planning to spend between $500-$1,000 on BTS shopping, any impediment to consumer sentiment and quality of experience can have dramatically bad effects. \nGiven the timeliness of the topic, let’s explore some of what we, at Radware, are seeing as significant trends both in the threat landscape targeting online retailers, but also changes they are making in their IT and business that play into the cyber threats.\n\nIt’s new to no one that online retailers were among the first of the hyper-targeted industries for cyber-attacks. The combination of holding valuable customer data, the high profile brands and even the potential for competitive cyber-attacks has had IT and security managers in this industry among the leaders in security strategy and operation for many years. This makes their input into Radware’s annual Global Application & Network Security Report of particular interest.\n\nWhat Keeps the Retail IT Guy Up at Night?\nWhen we survey the retail space, we largely find a well-educated and cautiously-confident bunch. Across the board, they have some of the highest scores of any industry when it comes to expressing confidence that they are well protected from most threats. Of course, that doesn’t mean they don’t have hot-buttons of concern.\n [You might also like: Your Risk Checklist to Protect Against Online Business Cybersecurity Threats]\nBy far, this category sees the professional hackers, those motivated by financial gain, as their biggest threat. Over 65% put this threat group as “top 2” among motivations and hacker types. The second largest area of concern interestingly comes from the insider threat, which when you consider the rate of turnover and seasonal employees involved in retail, makes good sense. Very few express concern over threats from competition, which could be something of a false sense of security. We do regularly see various attacks, website scraping as an example, targeting retailers with what seem to be competitive motivations.\nWhen we look into the impacts retailers feel and fear from cyber-attacks, two main ones jump out. First, over 50% of those surveyed say reputational damage is #1 or #2 on their list. In closer correlation, almost a third (32%) state customer or partner loss as the #1 most damaging potential impact from a cyber-attack.\nRetail Attack Trends: A View from the Front Line\nWhen we delve into the actual types of attacks seen by IT and security professionals in retail, we see some trends that on the surface may seem positive, but could point towards more troubling longer-term impacts. At Radware, we tend to consider attacks across three parameters: frequency, duration and complexity (generally measured by number of vectors). The retail space reports one of the lowest rates of frequency across the industries we survey. Only 17% say they see daily or weekly attacks, versus on average about 25% for other industries. Almost 40% say they only get attacked once or twice a year. These numbers could represent an over-reliance on certain attack detection technologies, or simply that many of the leaders in this space have effectively made themselves an expensive target for attackers.\nSimilarly, when it comes to attack duration, the online retail respondents report some of the shortest durations. Over 40% say attacks last one hour or less, and only 6% report attacks lasting over a week. Attack duration can be deceiving however. As more and more attack tools become automated, they are also adept at quickly identifying poor targets, and moving on. Chances are, one of these automated attack tools will come around utilizing a vector that the retailer cannot protect against.\nWhile confidence is high among retailers, so too is the recognition of significant financial impact from attack. Over 10% of respondents from this industry report that an attack will, on average, cost them $1-$3 million dollars, much higher than most industries. The high cost of attack is balanced by one of the higher levels of spending on cyber-attack protection. Retail is second among the surveyed industries on spending, with 35% spending over $1 million on dedicated cyber-attack protection. \nOnline Retailers, not just for retailing anymore\nFor the biggest of online retailers, the transition towards online business can have an even more dramatic effect, that of shifting their core competencies into whole new lines of business. At the extreme example, consider Amazon, once a pioneer in selling shoes online, to a transformative technology firm largely defining the cloud computing space. EBay is not far behind, finding increasingly that their core competencies have become running online transactional platforms, enabling successful acquisitions into new areas. This transition of course introduces whole new categories of attack, and in turn whole new levels of business risk. However, the sophisticated operations in this category have also discovered new paths of ROI.\nToday’s reality for the online retailer is that they face an increasingly complex set of cyber-attack threats, all of which have a good understanding of the seasonality of business. Staying diligent during and in-between these periods and having a strong view into the trends for both attacks and defenses is central to a mature online retail security strategy. \n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Hackers\', \'online business\', \'online retailers\', \'Retail\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/why-online-retailers-should-be-on-high-alert-for-cyber-attacks/');

Beginning now, students all across the globe are beginning to register for their classes, purchase their school supplies, and start working on assignments for the upcoming year. But among these students, there are some who will get up to no good – hacking into the school systems to alter records, to disrupt the school’s normal operations, and to see just how much damage they can do. Let’s take a closer look at some of the reasons why kids are hacking their schools:\n\n\n\nIt’s fun. What kid wouldn’t be intrigued by the idea of trying to hack into their school, with all its records at their disposal? With many teachers electing to have students submit assignments digitally and take exams online, some kids would find it fun to shut down the system so they and their classmates won’t have to submit their work or take a test.\n\n \n\nRevenge.In some cases, the reason for hacking is as simple as wanting to get back at the school for bestowing punishment upon the student. Disrupting normal operations, presumably without being caught, holds an allure for these kids.\n\n \n\nTo change grades. For those kids who are struggling with coursework, the temptation to hack lies in the ability to change their grades to more favorable ones. Not wanting to bring home a poor report card and face the wrath of their parents, many kids will see a hack as a way to avoid this.\n\n \n [You might also like: School Networks Getting Hacked – Is It the Students’ Fault?]\n \n\nTo change attendance. For the truants out there, hacking provides a way for them to change their attendance records and erase the fact they did not attend school, like Ferris Bueller in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”\n\n \n\nAs a dare. Ever heard the phrase “I double-dog-dare you!” on the playground? Kids have a hard time turning down an opportunity to prove themselves. If they don’t, they face bullying and teasing from classmates over not succeeding. In cases like these, it’s about the bragging rights.\n\n \nSo why should we be concerned about these kids hacking, when the reasons seem more trivial? One reason for concern is the way these students are going about hacking. If they are able to access the Darknet, there is a wealth of vendors offering services such as grade changes or denial of service attacks for hire. These kids don’t even need to know how to do the hacks themselves, all they need is the right amount of money pocketed away (sometimes as little as $19.99 a month). \nFor more information on schools and hacking, click here. \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'Education\', \'Hacking\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/5-reasons-why-kids-are-hacking-schools/');

Just a few years ago, attackers would have had to download simple GUI-based tool to launch a DoS attack.

Some of the most common attack vectors found on these sites are DNS, NTP, SSDP, Chargen, SSYN, ACK, XMLRPC, Portmap and Joomla.\nFor more about attack vectors, check out our recent ERT Alert.\nDue to their effectiveness, amplification-based attacks are the default attack technique offered by most booters services. These attacks are easy to conduct and rely on misconfigured services. The attacker sends a spoofed packet with the victim’s IP to the service, resulting in a response from the server sent to the victim’s IP. Attackers will also use reflection-based attacks by misusing popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and Joomla to generate HTTP requests to target web servers. They will also abuse gaming consoles and routers in an attempt to generate larger attacks. By using reflection and amplification, attackers are able to mask their origin and turn a tiny amount of bandwidth into a much larger scale assault.\nIn addition to these vectors, a number of services also offer tools on their website like resolvers, IP loggers, geo-location, ping and VPN detectors.\n [You might also like: Cyber Attack Market Place]\n\nFigure: zStress tools and services\nAdditional Services, Resolvers:\n\nDomain Resolver resolves the domain name to get the IP address of a server.\nProtection Resolver resolves a website’s IP address that is hidden behind a mitigation service.\nSkype Resolver resolves Skype username and returns their IP address.\n\nMost booting services today are using cloud-based hosting to leverage their network. By using cloud services to host their attack scripts they are able to provide larger bandwidth for their attacks. Owners behind these stresser services only have a few expenses to get their service up and running. One of the core expenses for owners is the back-end servers. These servers must allow IP address spoofing, have a fast uplink, 1Gbps+, and have unmetered bandwidth usage. Once the owner has their servers, all they have to do is setup the service by uploading the shell of their choice.\nStressers are not necessary illegal and there are many legitimate uses for such tools. Most legitimate services will require you to provide proof that you own the website and ISP, and have agreed to the network test. Unfortunately, most of the stresser services that we have observed do not require you to submit proof. Instead they try to hide behind their Terms of Service by putting the legal responsibility back onto those carrying out the attacks.\nTerms of Service:\n\nThuderstresser\nvDos\nGigastress\nInStress\nREstresser\nSYNstresser\nzStress\n\nBooters and stressers have become popular over the years with hacktivists like Anonymous. For the most part Anonymous is a collective of teenagers unable to compile a script, and forced to work at a collective level to obfuscate their inexperience. In the past we have seen hacktivists arrested for downloading LOIC and using attack tools without a VPN or any form of anonymization. Stressers offer potential hackers a layer of anonymization with the website acting as a proxy. \nThis growth around stresser services has resulted in a wide array of powerful and affordable tools available in the marketplace. Since the beginning of 2016, Radware has witnessed these tools being used against ISP’s, media, financial service companies, online gaming and other industries. Organizations are being forced to improve defenses as these tools combine high traffic volumes with multi-vector attacks.  Companies are quickly racing to buy bigger pipes in an attempt to combat the growth in large scale attack services, but this is a futile attempt. Stresser owners are hedging their bets for profit and will purchase and use the same massive cloud services that some of their victims use. \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'booters\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'Hackers\', \'stressers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/the-rise-of-booter-and-stresser-services/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (221, 'In the Crosshairs: Six Cyber Security Threats Gunning for Your Online Business', 'Radware', '2016-8-10', 'In today’s hyper-connected world, nearly all businesses, regardless of size or industry, have some element of their operations based online. From the largest online retailers and financial service companies to gaming and social media brands, organizations are transforming how they conduct business and have become increasingly dependent on network-based services. Even the smallest service-oriented organizations rely on the Internet for ecommerce or as a platform to deliver services to employees and partners.\n\nThese pros also come with some cons. Online businesses have become juicy targets for cyber assailants. Certain industries face a heightened level of threat due to the unique level of business operations and revenue generated online. The threat landscape targeting these organizations is growing in virulence, driven by hackers seeking to take advantage of the knowledge that these businesses cannot afford downtime or loss of customer trust.\nBecause of this, security teams from online businesses have always been among the leaders in exploring and adopting security capabilities that protect online revenue generation, service delivery platforms and sensitive customer data. However, the threat landscape continues to adapt to new protections, forcing a continuous effort to stay innovative and ahead of the latest cyber assault trends, tactics and tools. To help online businesses reduce the risk of downtime, lost revenue and resulting customer churn, here are six of the most common cyber security threats targeting online businesses.\n\n \nAvailability Attacks (including distributed denial of service)\nFor decades, information security has focused on the ‘security triad’ of confidentiality, integrity and availability. In many cases, investments in information security have focused much more on the first two of these principles much more than the third. However, as more critical aspects of business operations shift towards online models, availability becomes an equal tenant to the others. Attackers have become adept at exploiting remaining deficiencies however, largely through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are consistently among the most frequently experienced attacks.\n \nRansom Attacks\nThere has been an increase in ransom as a motivation for cyber-attacks, increasing from 16% in 2014 to 25% in 2015, according to Radware’s 2015 – 2016 Global Application & Network Security Report. These ransom attacks are on the rise for a number of reasons. First, the ease of access and relative low cost of launching disruptive attacks makes the motive of immediate financial gain attractive. So too does the increased ease of masking the source of attacks through spoofing IPs or accessing targets via a CDN or global NAT that will obfuscate the exact attacking resources as part of a broader network.\n \n [You might also like: Your Risk Checklist to Protect Against Online Business Cybersecurity Threats]\nAdvanced Bot Attacks\nBot-generated attacks targeting web application infrastructure are increasing in both volume and scope, with the list of attack vectors—and associated risk profiles—growing. Among the most common: web attacks, such as SQL injections and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), web scraping, web application DDoS, brute-force attacks on login pages for password cracking, comment spammers, clickjacking and fraud. Some bot-generated attacks are static; others are dynamic over time. Simple, script-based bots are not much of a challenge to detect and block. The same cannot be said of more advanced bots. Those based on headless browser technology, such as PhantomJS, dramatically complicate the detection process by mimicking user behavior, passing challenges (e.g. CAPTCHA), or by serving up dynamic IP addresses.\n \nTransaction Fraud\nOnline transaction fraud costs an estimated $3.5 billion annually. Much of this activity is attributed to the theft of consumer credit card information breached by application attacks that exploit online business applications. The impacts of transaction fraud also extend beyond the immediate transactions. Consumers consistently say that if their sensitive data is breached, they will likely no longer conduct business with that merchant. A common set of attack references with regard to transaction fraud are those tracked by the Open Web Application Security Project as part of their OWASP Top 10 list. Among those, SQL Injection consistently ranks as a top threat targeting illegitimate access to applications and backend databases.\n \nEncrypted Attacks\nIn the same way, SSL and encryption protect the integrity of legitimate communications, they equally obfuscate many attributes of traffic used to determine if it malicious versus legitimate. Identifying attack traffic within encrypted traffic flows is akin to finding a needle in a haystack…in the dark. Most cyber security solutions struggle to identify potentially malicious traffic from encrypted traffic sources and isolate that traffic for further analysis (and potential mitigation). The other major advantage that SSL attacks offer to attackers is the ability to put significant computing stress on network and application infrastructures they target. The process of decrypting and re-encrypting SSL traffic increases the requirements of processing the traffic, in many cases beyond the functional performance of devices used for attack mitigation.\n \n Dynamic Content and CDN-based Attacks\nAs online businesses mature and build global web properties, they often turn to Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers to support site performance. CDNs provide a particularly insidious cover for bad actors as they cannot be blocked by origin servers as accepting transactions and requests from their IPs is the basis for use of their content distribution capabilities. Malicious actors have made an art form out of spoofing IP addresses to not only obfuscate their identity but also to possibly masquerade as seemingly legitimate users based on geolocation or positive reputational information about IP addresses they are able to compromise. Dynamic content attacks further exploit CDN-based protection by overloading origin servers with requests for non-cached content that the CDN nodes simply pass along.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyber threat\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'dos attack\', \'online businesses\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/six-cyber-security-threats-gunning-for-your-online-business/');

Have you ever met a vendor who did not offer “advanced automation,” “flexible customization” and “granular visibility”?\nThe fact that all vendors promise the same values makes you doubt the necessity of their management consoles. After all, you are buying their solution for a certain purpose – whether for security, networking, virtualization or application. So do you really need that system?\n\nThe surprising answer is – it depends. It depends on what your expectations are, and depends on the management system’s ability to fulfill them.\nPurchasing a new solution in the information-flood era is a sweat-producing task. For months you have been evaluating several solutions, testing various technologies and negotiating with clever sales reps on one hand and your strict procurement team on the other.\nAnd then, right before you make your final decision and get some well-deserved relief comes your selected vendor, who tries to up-sell their management system. Do you really need it?\n\nHere are five benefits you should be looking for in order to answer that question:\n\nProductivity\nIt is challenging to measure the ROI of IT investment in dollar value, but it is quite sensible in terms of the bandwidth of your staff. They should have more time dedicated to other tasks rather than operating that particular solution. In addition, you can measure how much time different tasks are taking when utilizing the management system compared to running them without it. For instance – 80% reduction of an application rollout, configuration of multiple devices, and turning manual tasks into a no-brainer, automatic task that takes just a few clicks, etc.\n\n\nAutomation\n\nRunning dozens of solutions in your network can result in spending too much time on maintenance and troubleshooting.  Your management system should help streamline the execution of complex operations and reduce the maintenance effort via scheduled tasks, auto-updates, and simplification of tedious tasks (for example – SSL certifications health check).\n [You might also like: “POP” Goes the Vendor that Doesn’t Separate Scrubbing Centers from Always-On Platforms]\nAutomation gives you the following benefits, which you can easily evaluate:\n\nAccelerated productivity\nReduction in human errors\nElimination of the “know-how” dependency, allowing non-experts to maintain the operation via wizards\n\n\nCustomization\n\nEvery environment is unique and challenging to orchestrate. It may take a few adjustments to make sure the new solution you invest in integrates well into the network. Does the management system have the flexibility you need? Are you able to extend its feature set to better match your network and your needs? Yes, these can refer to predicted capabilities such as customized reports, GUI, language and more. Can you write your own scripts and enjoy an interactive programmable platform? You should think specifically on what you expect the system to do, and based on that ideal model evaluate the solutions in front of you to learn which one best matches your ideal design.\n\nVisibility\nYour number one goal is to manage and maintain the optimal operations of your service. But reality poses constant challenges to your ability to control the application performance and the user SLA experience. You need visibility to the software versions, applications and traffic patterns that are constantly changing. Your management system should help you keep up with these changes. Do you have a clear portal that intuitively tells you where your attention is required? Which changes have been made? What kind of real-time monitoring and historical reporting capabilities does it support? How deep can you drill down to learn from events that occurred? Are there any tools, tips and remediation recommendations? This is highly crucial when monitoring network security or application service level. You always need to control both and make sure they are at their maximum.\n\n\nExtras\nThe solution you implement interacts with many other solutions in the network. Can the management system sense and indicate when an interface slows down the network, or when an application service suffers from service degradation? Third party event notifications can indicate a smart management system that supports your workflows. This information can also help resolve responsibility disputes between the network, application and/or security teams.\n\n \nFinally, as you have already decided to invest in a certain solution, why not get the most out of it? Many of these management systems extend the capabilities of the solution itself. You can assume the vendor conducted some research on network trends and future projections of integrated solutions. Trust them to develop management consoles capable of assuring the operation of their products so it will do what it is designed for, and will do it in the best way possible.\nThere is a lot of value you can get from a management system. You will enjoy more uptime, accelerated productivity and save OPEX.  And hopefully, enjoy a simpler life.\n\n\nDownload our eBook “Opportunities, Threats and Security Strategies for Online Business” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'management system\', \'vendor\', \'vendor management\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/08/vendor-management-systems/');

This is called APDoS.\nHow does this work? The concept is really quite simple. It’s akin to the way bomber aircraft would jam radar systems many years ago. If you premise is that you are going to be detected, then change the premise. Present the detecting organization with so many targets of so many different types that it’s nearly impossible to detect them all, and more importantly, to mitigate them in a high enough quality not to effect legitimate traffic.\nLet’s look closer at what Wikipedia defines APDoS as:\n“APDoS is more likely to be perpetrated by actors who are well resourced, exceptionally skilled and have access to substantial commercial grade computer resources and capacity. APDoS attacks represent a clear and emerging threat needing specialised monitoring and incident response services and the defensive capabilities of specialised DDoS mitigation service providers. This type of attack involves massive network layer DDoS attacks through to focused application layer (HTTP) floods, followed by repeated (at varying intervals) SQLI and XSS attacks. Typically, the perpetrators can simultaneously use from 2 to 5 attack vectors involving up to several tens of millions of requests per second, often accompanied by large SYN floods that can not only attack the victim but also any service provider implementing any sort of managed DDoS mitigation capability. These attacks can persist for several weeks.”\n\nNow, if you digest this and take a look at the types of attacks, it’s clear that APDoS would require a lot of varied technology to stop the nature of network floods, HTTP application-level DDoS and encrypted threats. Moreover, the case of Protonmail, we are now seeing the problem manifest to SMTP attacks (somewhat new vector) and secure-SMTP such as TLS over SMTP.\n [You might also like: Could Your Network Survive APDoS or Hit-and-Run DDoS?]\nMany companies who have procured DDoS solutions have no thought about the threat from a broader spectrum such as SMTP or FTP and secure variants such as those.\nIn fact, Wikipedia gives us more to think about in as the go on, “Attackers in this scenario may (or often will) tactically switch between several targets to create a diversion to evade defensive DDoS countermeasures but all the while eventually concentrating the main thrust of the attack onto a single victim. In this scenario, threat actors with continuous access to several very powerful network resources are capable of sustaining a prolonged campaign generating enormous levels of un-amplified DDoS traffic.”\nSo what’s a company to do? Well first understand the threat and then make certain you have protections (e.g. high caliber detection and mitigation) from the variants.\nWikipedia suggest that APDoS attacks are characterised by the following:\n\n“Advanced reconnaissance (pre-attack OSINT and extensive decoyed scanning crafted to evade detection over long periods)\nTactical execution (attack with a primary and secondary victims but focus is on Primary)\nExplicit motivation (a calculated end game/goal target)\nLarge computing capacity (access to substantial computer power and network bandwidth resources)\nSimultaneous multi-threaded ISO layer attacks (sophisticated tools operating at layers 3 through 7)\nPersistence over extended periods (utilising all the above into a concerted, well managed attack across a range of targets)”\n\nThe task is clearly daunting and real. As the next generation of DDoS threats emerge we must be very diligent and proactive. I believe that companies need to rise above the normal corporate culture of security controls and become obsessive about removing risks and compulsive about action. After all, these organizations may literally be holding life and death decisions in their hands – and this makes their actions rather profound and very unique.\nIn the end, I hope we can agree that the klaxon is sounding and actions need to be impactful to avoid catastrophes.

Microsoft UAG/TMG evolved over many years to integrate multiple functions to protect Microsoft applications. It is a key component of several Microsoft application deployments including Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint and Lync. However, the TMG and UAG deployments are not limited to protecting Microsoft applications.\nSecuring web applications accessible over the web is a complex task. A compromise may lead to a significant performance hit to the application, especially when under an attack that may impact business, or worse, security breaches.\n\n\nAs these products approach their end of support (April 2020), a common question from customers is “What do I do to secure my Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint deployment?” Although some of the security functions are integrated into new Microsoft products, there is no direct replacement of TMG and UAG from Microsoft.\nTMG and UAG protect Microsoft applications and users from cyber threats by integrating several security functions such as SSL encryption and decryption, application security and aspects of malware protection such as filtering security exploits and vulnerabilities, in addition to network functions such as routing, and network performance features such as compression and caching.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nSo, trying to find an enterprise-grade replacement, integrating many complex aspects of evolving application security, all of them in an integrated solution, makes the replacement very challenging. Microsoft TMG customers need to deploy a replacement that can, at a minimum, provide the same level of functionality and protection for Microsoft applications in internet facing scenarios, but should also address the next generation of cloud-based applications.\n [You might also like: Microsoft TMG EOL Got You Down? Here are Options for Replacements]\nTo replace Microsoft TMG and UAG, enterprises need to consider several important factors that will help maintain the existing functionality provided by Microsoft TMG, while minimizing network and application configuration changes. Such considerations include:\n1. Integrated functionality: the TMG replacement solution must provide the same, if not better, set of functionality, including routing, security and performance enhancement, in a simple package that can be managed centrally.\n2. Scalability: a TMG replacement solution must provide simple and cost effective scalability to allow future expansion, both for traffic capacity and number of applications supported. It needs to minimize the amount of effort required to upgrade the solution.\n3. Network topology: TMG protects both the front-end application servers typically located in the DMZ, as well as the backend servers that are typically deployed inside the organization’s private LAN. The security functionality needs to be provided at both ends of the network.\nAs you look for replacement solutions, you’ll need to evaluate the functionality of Microsoft UAG or TMG in use and assess your needs for securing multiple applications – whether they are on premise or in the cloud, the experience you’d like your users to receive, such as single sign on (SSO) as well as how these replacement solution will be managed.\nFor more details:\nUpgrade Enterprise Application Security with Alteon NG\nAlteon NG Application Delivery Controller/Load Balancer\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Microsoft TMG/UAG\', \'Radware Alteon\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2016/07/microsoft-tmg-replacement-blues/');

Once infected, devices can perform tasks like record audio and video, take photos, send text messages, open webpages, steal user data, delete files, launch denial of service attacks via HTTP floods, and perform web injections.\nTargets include the International Olympic Committee, carriers & service providers, Olympic sponsors, the media, and the venues.\nHow to Prepare\nTechnology can provide a more immersive and rewarding experience for fans, but also create problems and security risks for those managing the event. The Brazilian government and businesses associated with the Olympics should understand the risk and their exposure.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (227, 'Was There a DDoS Attack on Pokemon Go or Not?  Does It Really Matter?', 'Frank Yue', '2016-7-19', 'Pokemon Go launched recently on July 6 with an overwhelming response from fans and players signing up in unprecedented numbers. By July 12, there were over 21 million active users who had downloaded the game to their phones to catch Pokemon like Pikachu and Charmander.\nOf course, with the massive influx of players to the game, there were connectivity issues. Potential players could not create accounts and afterwards, they were only logging into the game intermittently. This is most likely due to the game’s designers not properly predicting the number of people wanting to play and scaling out the appropriate pieces of the infrastructure including the registration servers, authentication servers, and application servers.\n\n\nSecond launch, same results\nOn Saturday, July 16, the game was made available in 26 new countries, mostly in Europe. This second wave of people downloading and playing the game overloaded the game authentication and application servers again. This time, soon after the European launch, some hacker groups claimed responsibility for launching a DDoS attack on the game’s infrastructure, causing the outages. Both OurMine and PoodleCorp claimed responsibility and achieved some credit in the media that they launched an attack to successfully disable the Pokemon Go game temporarily.\nIn reality, there is little evidence to conclude that they actually caused the outage or if they even launched a DDoS attack. It is more plausible that they are claiming credit after the fact, latching onto the intense media attention being paid to the game. It was most likely the launch of the game in 26 new countries and the influx of new registrations and players that caused the recent game disruptions. This is not different from terrorist organizations claiming responsibility after the fact for disasters which are often due to other causes that the terrorist group had no influence on (natural disaster, mechanical failure, human error, etc.).\n\nHaving said that, the potential for a DDoS attack to succeed against an already stressed infrastructure is much higher than normal. The threshold for the systems to be affected is now much lower because the player registrations and logons are essentially creating a legitimate DDoS attack on their own.\n [You might also like: Pokemon Go Does Not Have to Be Down or Slow]\nLearn from your mistakes\nBusinesses need to properly prepare and have contingency plans for scenarios such as this. It is unfortunate, though understandable, that the Pokemon Go developers missed the surge of interest at the initial game launch.\nOne is less forgiving for the game developer to experience a similar situation 10 days later with the expanded launch. This hurts the credibility of the game, the experience of the players, and directly impacts the potential revenue due to the lost players who either did not download the game or had problems with the game and abandoned it.\nThey also expose themselves to nefarious groups who want to ride on the coattails of the media attention that the game is getting by claiming responsibility for attacks that may not have happened. This shows how vulnerable the infrastructure is to real DDoS threats in the future and will only continue to provide unwanted negative attention to an otherwise popular and successful game.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Was There a DDoS Attack on Pokemon Go or Not?

As an IT person, it’s hard not be afraid when cyber attackers are always one step ahead of you. And, they have been quite busy this year, DDoSing, spreading malware, Ransoming and Doxing. I’m sure the stories have filled your newsfeeds.\nThe Bigger Picture\nTo understand what’s happening in the threat landscape, we need to put aside the headlines for a moment and focus on the bigger picture. There are five interesting trends that have implications for the way we perceive security, both as organizations and as individuals.\n\n\n1. Cyber Ransom\nLet’s say a couple of teenagers are up to no good and loitering outside your house. When you arrive home, they ask for money and threaten that they will spray your house with paintballs if you don’t. You laugh off the threat, thinking it’s just a few paintballs. However, the two teenagers return the next day with 50 of their friends, all of them armed with paintball guns.\nThis extortion method is now very popular in the virtual space, in the shape of DDoS threats. “If you don’t pay us – we will take down your network. Or your website. Or both.” These threat letters have been proven to be very profitable (for the perpetrators).\nIn fact, they worked so well that we saw more and more groups joining the game – some very capable ones, and many other copycats (here are some tips to tell the real from the fake). DD4BC, Armada collective, Kadyrovtsy and ezBTC Squad are some who have the ability to launch DDoS attacks at various volumes. Their threats are to be taken seriously, and in most cases a short “Demo” attack will follow the ransom note. These threats are also applicable to small and medium-sized businesses who do not have as high security walls as larger enterprises.\nC-Suite Execs Say Won’t Pay Ransom Attacks, Until They Get Hacked, Radware Survey Finds\nIn parallel, ransomware also took its turn on companies. Initially it was used to harvest small amounts from helpless individuals…until the moment the attackers realized organizations can and will pay more.\nNumerous new ransom malware types were introduced in early 2016 – the most common were Locky, Petya, Samas, Cerber and Bart. This plague hit everywhere, propagating in various forms such as spam, phishing and even Dropbox. These files are typically disguised as software updates, photos or documents (like invoices or CVs) but contain a malicious script used to encrypt all the files on the machine. Further analysis and tips for protection can be found here.\n [You might also like: Ransom, Ransom Everywhere]\n2. DDoS Commoditization\nIt is well known that DDoS attack tools are available on the Darknet. But in 2016, they are also available on the Clearnet for as low as $5. Here’s why this is important for businesses:\nImagine I had a horrible customer service experience at the café nearby, and was so upset that I took down their website for the whole evening, causing a loss of $1,500 – their average gross sales from evening deliveries. I don’t need to be a hacker to do it; I can just pay those five bucks and it’s done. I don’t need the know-how of a superpower hacker or the ultimate computer geek. All I have to do is choose my favorite DDoS tools.\nThe same applies for large businesses. For $350 I can hire a botnet or a stressed service to launch a 400Gbps DDoS attack. Some tools today are capable of doing much more than a simple flood, and can generate layer 3-7 multi-vector attacks that combine several DDoS techniques (floods, low and slow, SSL, etc.).\n\n\n \n3. Cyber Protests\nOne may say that hacktivism is not new. However, as technology evolves – including social and communication channels, together with the availability of attack tools – hacktivists can pull out a successful operation quite quickly. We have seen hackers respond promptly to local controversies, such as the police shooting African-American suspects, the debate around the North-Carolina “bathroom law”, the city of Denver ban against homeless residents and more.\nDuring these attacks, state and city websites were hit by DDoS attacks, and confidential data – mostly related to officials – was stolen and later published on the web.\nJust as it happened in the US, it can happen anywhere else. In Africa, the Anonymous community has launched an operation (OpAfrica) against governments and leading corporations whom they hold accountable for corruption and child abuse.\nHackers also protest around universal causes such as animal rights. On top of targeting industries for trading animal-made products, every year during the whale hunting season Japan, Denmark and Norway suffer continuous attempts of DDoS attacks against government and leading enterprises. Examples include the network outages at Tokyo Narita airport and the take-down of Nissan’s websites.\n\n4. Elections\nThis particular example of the cyber protest may have the biggest impact of them all. Recently, Donald Trump and his business holdings have been victims of DDoS attacks & SQL injections. Hackers have penetrated the U.S. DNC, stealing classified information. The national election committee in the Philippines was breached and doxed, followed by a debate around the security of the e-voting system in Australia. On May 3, Anonymous members in Spain were arrested for hacking the central electoral board.\nHere are a few questions we should ask following the rising engagement of the cyber community in national elections:\n\nPersonal cyber-attacks – any influential person should expect them. Trump’s case suggests that every person with power and influence is subject to potential resistance from hacktivists, and should have a cyber-attack mitigation plan in place to protect personal and business holdings. By nature, political defiance may result in ongoing, continuous attempts.\nSecurity of electric voting systems. The Philippines COMELEC breach has shown e-voting systems may be prone to be compromised. What happens if the government saves a few dollars when designing the security architecture, or not constantly patching it? That gives hackers the power to steal population records and alter the vote data.\n\n\nCan cyber activity change election results? Beyond the general concern to election voting systems, such an event can potentially lead to psychological bias of voters, reduce election participation rates, undermine the governing party’s support, and more.\nRift among hacktivists over political affiliation. Another interesting aspect which is not directly linked to cyber security is the evolving debate between hackers about the core identity of Anonymous – whether it can or cannot be politically affiliated, or remain loyal to universal causes such as freedom of information, opposing oppression and correcting injustice.\n\nThe long debate, resulting in withdrawing of hackers from participation, created a lot of uncertainty around the attack operations, and definitely reduced their impact.\n [You might also like: Malware and Botnet Attack Services Found on the Darknet]\n5. IoT botnets\nRight before the semester ended, we saw the long predicted threat come true.\nPCWorld has reported “25,000 digital video recorders and CCTV cameras were compromised and used to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, flooded targets with about 50,000 HTTP requests per second”.\nThere are 3 main takeaways from that incident:\n\n“Smart Appliances” manufacturers have to be mindful of producing resilient products with robust security components\nNetwork carriers have to be able to detect and manage traffic originated from such devices, to protect enterprise customers\nEnterprise customers should understand that when making a security investment to protect their infrastructure and assets, they need to be able to protect not only from today’s threats, but also from those which rise in the next 3-5 years\n\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/07/5-cyber-attack-developments-worth-your-attention/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (229, 'Malware and Botnet Attack Services Found on the Darknet', 'Daniel Smith', '2016-7-13', 'Over the last several months we have explored a number of attack marketplaces along with the different tools and services offered on the Darknet. In this post we are going to take a deeper look at the different malware and botnet services found on the Darknet. \nA botnet is a collection of compromised computers that are often referred to as zombies, slaves, or bots. These devices are infected by malware that allows the attacker to ultimately control the compromised computers. The owner of a botnet is often referred to as a “herder” and is able to control the infected devices through covert channels like an Internet Relay Chat (IRC), that allows the attacker to issue commands. These commands inputted into the Command and Control server (C&C) tell the bots in the botnet what to do, such as performing denial of service attacks, sending spam with ransomware attached or information theft.\n\n\nWe have even seen the rise of smartphone botnets over the last few years. Malware like DroidJack is easily leveraged to target mobile users via malicious 3rd party app stores that are offering popular games like Pokémon Go, but with a surprise waiting for them inside the unverified Android application package, APK. Once infected, devices can perform tasks like record audio and video, take photos, send text messages, open webpages, steal user data, delete files, launch denial of service attacks via HTTP floods and perform web injections if supported.\n [You might also like: The Rise of Smartphone Botnets]\n\nTo compound this problem, not only are computers and mobile devices susceptible to becoming enslaved into a botnet, but so are Internet of Things (IoT) devices like your wearables, remotely managed environmental devices, industrial systems, and even printers and routers. All of these newly connected devices run code on a microprocessor and are all susceptible to becoming enslaved in a botnet. There is little to no oversight or security for these IoT devices and are normally connected to the internet with default conditions. This means any hacker able to scan for these devices can also use simple online tools like RouterPassword.com to check if the device still has its default login, admin:admin. If the device still has default conditions, a hacker can compromise and inject malware into them, bringing them under their control just like a PC or a phone. Many groups like Lizard Squad have successfully done this with routers and most recently with CCTV’s.\n\nAll of these methods for creating a botnet have helped contribute to the growth of the attack marketplace found on both the Darknet and the Clearnet. At the rate we are seeing DDoS attacks, ransomware campaigns and information theft, it’s no wonder why there are so many vendors selling botnet-related services. Botnets are big business that lead to financial gain. A few years ago it was very difficult to buy or rent a botnet. Most had to build their own or rely on a friend to help guide them. Today the average 12-year-old armed with their allowance converted to Bitcoin can shop till they can drop a server.  At most marketplaces found on the Darknet, a potential attacker can buy anything from DDoS as a Service and botnet rentals to full package botnets and enslaved packages containing thousands of infected computers for just a few bucks. They can even purchase bulletproof hosting to keep their C&C’s well protected.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nBotnets\nDiamondFox – Aka Gorynch, is capable of launching DDoS attacks, RAM scraping for credit card information and passwords, checking for VM and researcher detection and contains a USB/Dropbox spreader. This botnet communicated over HTTP to a C&C developed in PHP.\nCitadel –  Descendent of the Zeus botnet. Capable of file downloads, screen capture, Firefox cookie theft, MoneyPak ransom, and dynamic webinject.\nNeutrino – Capable of launching HTTP/HTTPS flood via GET and POST method, AntiDDoS via emulation JS and cookies as well as Slowloris, TCP and UDP attacks.  This tool can also detect sandboxes and AV.\n\nSome of the botnet-related malware found on the Darknet today is old or repackaged variants. These packages often sell for just a few dollars in the marketplace due to the software being freely available on the Clearnet. The Darknet marketplace simply offers a one-stop-shop for those who do not or cannot take the time to build a botnet on their own. There are even vendors that will set up a botnet for you, leaving you only with the task of spreading your malicious file to potential zombies.\nIf you are a more advanced hacker, you can check out one of the many malware repositories found on the Darknet. Darkweb pages like Cerberus offer massive malware libraries for the advanced users to comb through. Attackers can easily abuse this service and download anything from Remote Access Trojans and Worms to Botnet and DOS’er malware to target their victims. These pieces of malware often come with no description and require the user to have advanced knowledge of what to do with each file.\n [You might also like: 5 Ways Hackers Market Their Products and Services]\n\nFor the most part a non-skilled attacker can easily purchase the required services need to have their own botnet up and running in just a few days. Not only can they find free services or paid setup but they can also rent botnet for temporary use. Botnets can be monetized in more than one way and rentals are a potential windfall. The average rental cost for a large botnet can cost between .025 – .05 BTC per hour depending on its size. One of the latest botnet rental services that we are currently analyzing offers access to 1.2 Million US based devices for $75 per hour. This botnet is capable of producing over 100Gbps attacks and offers multiple attack vectors.\n\nFinancial gain is the main motivation behind the evolution and the growth of the attack market place. Vendors are looking to make a quick buck off of the over sensationalized hacking culture and botnet are the main corner stone of the current culture. Everyone wants to be a hacker but many are not willing to put in the effort to become a true hacker. Vendors are praying on this weakness and offering attack services at a lower cost than their competitors. Those that are not willing to learn and are buying these services are only validating the vendor’s objective and encouraging a competitive marketplace. This monetization has led to a much lower buy in and a more competitive market place. Vendors are now the researchers pushing the limits looking for the newest and most efficient vectors of attack.\nPrice once again in the attack market place is the only limiting factor. Companies are quickly racing to buy bigger pipes in an attempt to combat the growth in botnet based attacks but this is futile attempt.  There is now a developing botnet market and those vendors hedging their bets will be purchasing and using the same massive services their targets are using. If you can buy it, so can an attacker.  \n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/07/malware-and-botnet-attack-services-found-on-the-darknet/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (230, 'Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation: Which is Right for Your Organization?', 'Jordan Jacobs', '2016-7-12', 'Two facts are changing how companies think about DDoS mitigation: DDoS attacks are more frequent than ever and are increasingly easier to initiate from anywhere in the world.\nSimply put, the days when firewalls and a large enough pipe to the internet were enough to protect your network have long since passed. Any organization or website is a potential target, and with high odds of a given attack flooding homegrown defense tactics, most companies are moving their mitigation tools offsite. The cost of downtime – upwards of $9,000 per hour for small businesses and $690,000 for large companies – are just too great to risk going it alone.\n\nIn a marketplace with countless solutions and several models for mitigation, what’s the best way to approach the growing DDoS threat? That’s the single most frequent question I receive from customers when discussing cybersecurity.\nThere are two good options, in my opinion:\n\nSubscribe to a cloud-based DDoS mitigation service, in which malicious traffic is scrubbed before good traffic is rerouted back to the client’s data center.\nUtilize DDoS mitigation appliances at a managed hosting provider’s data center.\n\nEach approach will get the job done, but depending on the circumstances, preferences and budgets of individual organizations, there are some differences worth noting.\n\nCloud-Based Mitigation\nCloud DDoS protection is a fantastic option for companies who want to maintain their on-premise data center, but aren’t able to deploy an adequate mitigation solution.\n [You might also like: Adaptive Managed Services Bolster Security]\nThe primary advantage with cloud-based protection is the sheer scale of mitigation capacity. Because traffic can easily be diverted through scrubbing centers around the world, organizations can withstand attacks in the Terabits per second.\nPremium, always-on cloud protection services, which route all traffic through cloud POPs, are effective and hands-off solutions, but can be cost prohibitive for many organizations. Alternatively, on-demand cloud services, which only activate when a volumetric attack is identified, are more affordable but sacrifice real-time detection. The latter solution is typically not optimal for application-level DDoS attacks.\nIn all cases with cloud protection, there will be some degree of latency at play — especially compared to solutions that reside at the perimeter of a network. While Radware’s Always-On Cloud DDoS protection excels at limiting latency, be aware that other cloud-based protection solutions on the market will require some level of human intervention that can limit the effectiveness of attack mitigation and add to existing network latency.\nProvider-Managed Mitigation \nProvider-managed DDoS mitigation services are ideal for companies who are planning on or are already hosting web servers and applications off-site.\nFirst off, latency is not a concern in this option, because the mitigation device sits at the network perimeter, adjacent to customers’ servers.\nBecause the mitigation tools used at managed hosting providers are based on dedicated hardware platforms, the amount of bandwidth customers are guaranteed during an attack doesn’t approach the multi-terabit level offered by the cloud.\nThey do, however, provide good value and coverage for the price.\nFor example, DDoS protection offered by my company, managed hosting provider SingleHop, follows very much the same model as any insurance policy. We partner with Radware to make this possible. The plan’s “premium” grants customers access to our data centers’ powerful Radware DefensePro mitigation devices should they ever need it. DefensePro DDoS prevention device detects attacks in-real time and mitigates them without prohibiting legitimate traffic.\n [You might also like: Static Cloud Security is Obsolete; Long Live Continuously Adaptive Cloud Security!]\nAs the provider, we’re able to make these premiums economical for customers because we’re able to plan for the maximum capacity needed to filter out illicit traffic during a DDoS attack at any given time, knowing that all of our customers won’t need access to it at once. This cost spreading assures DDoS attack prevention and protection in the vast majority of DDoS situations for a monthly cost that is well within reach for companies with limited IT and security budgets.\nThere’s one other benefit of using Radware-powered DDoS through a hosting provider: Access to network operations engineers who monitor the network 24/7 and manage all attacks. It’s one less function company IT teams have to worry about, which means they can redirect their IT efforts in other productive areas.\nTo recap, both cloud-based and provider-managed DDoS protection services are huge upgrades over most homegrown or on-premise strategies. The biggest factors in deciding one over the other will be: where the organization hosts, the size of the organization’s cybersecurity budget, and the organization’s sensitivity to latency.\nFortunately, if you want the benefits of both options, Radware offers highly efficient hybrid protection solutions that allow providers like SingleHop, or companies that manage on-premise data centers, to utilize the cloud for extended coverage whenever necessary.\nJordan Jacobs oversees SingleHop’s product life cycle through all phases, from conceptualization to market.

Changes such as technology adoption within industry tend to create new points of vulnerability, which quickly become the targets of malicious actors looking to exploit these new-found points of access. This year has been a particularly eye-opening year for the healthcare industry, which has seen a rash of recent attacks targeting their increased reliance on technology and networked data, often through the tactic of ransom attacks.\nThe increase in ransom attacks was one of the many interesting angles we saw within the inputs of the healthcare industry through our survey. Others provide additional insight into areas IT and security practitioners in the space have more or less concern, or feel either exposed or more or less secure.\n\nA View into What’s Behind Attacks on Healthcare\nOne of the first questions to ask when considering the threat landscape targeting healthcare providers is motive. Without question, it takes a different level of vitriol to maliciously target an organization that is providing healthcare, recognizing the impacts can inflict very real harm. These attacks tend to be much less frequently driven by script-kiddies or more casual attacks. This is borne out in the inputs we get from healthcare companies through the survey.\nBy far, the most commonly cited motive behind these attacks is financial gains through professional hacker groups. 75% of respondents called this segment the most dangerous for their industry. There was also a high response to the risk of insider threats, with 58% saying this was a very real concern. This was the highest response rate across all industries for this type of threat.\nHealthcare was also the highest industry responding to ransom attacks, with 50% saying they were the target of such an attack in 2015. We can see from the recent headlines that unfortunately this trend continues.\nThe healthcare industry also struggles, as many do, with understanding the motive behind attacks. 66% of respondents said they were unclear on what the motives were, the second highest rate across industries surveyed.\n\nTrends around attack types, frequency and impact\nWhether you know the motive or not, being prepared for attacks is an obvious requirement. Healthcare providers are frequent targets of real attacks, not just empty ransom threats. 75% of those responding from the healthcare industry report being the target of at least one attack during 2015. Of the remaining 25%, two-thirds acknowledge they cannot be sure they were not attacked. By and large, the industry expects the rate of targeting to increase. When asked about their expectations for the frequency of attack, we saw a jump in those expecting daily or weekly attacks from 25% to 33%.\n [You might also like: Sustained Vigilance Key for Financial Services Organizations in Light of Stable, Steady Threat Landscape]\nAnother important factor when looking at attacks is their duration, i.e., how long do they last. Interestingly, the healthcare industry reported one of the longest average duration of attack, at 142 hours per attack. This is higher than the average duration reported by both the telecommunications and financial services industries. Of particular concern is that the average was driven up by a high number (18%) reporting attacks lasting over one month, yet this industry had the lowest level of confidence in their ability to fight attacks for over one month (8%).\nUnderstanding the Operational Impact\nAn undeniable shift and a wake-up call of sorts for the healthcare industry is how these attacks impact ongoing operations. For many years, the primary focus of IT and security professionals in healthcare has been around protecting patient data from breach. Many industry regulatory requirements exist around protection from these kinds of breaches, as well as a variety of fines and necessary notification requirements if and when a breach does occur.\nBut the recent ransom attacks have put a bright light on another potentially more serious impact, that of interrupting actual delivery of healthcare. The introduction of new technologies into healthcare has brought with it a new level of reliance on network and data accessibility. We are very clearly at a stage where life-and-death scenarios become a reality when doctors and nurses cannot access critical information due to network downtime. This is forcing a broadening of the lens for healthcare IT on threats to availability, balancing out from an over-emphasis on confidentiality and integrity.\nUnderestimating the Impact of DDoS\nReflected in this over-emphasis on breach of sensitive data is the healthcare industry’s attitude towards Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks, despite growing dramatically in frequency and size, ranked lowest for the healthcare industry, with only 8% saying these attacks were a major concern. Additionally, half of those surveyed from healthcare said they had no current solution and no future plans for DDoS attack protection. We have already seen ransom attacks against this industry targeting the vulnerabilities around DDoS to disrupt operations. Most troubling about these attacks is unlike a ransomware attack, where generally exploit has already occurred, a DDoS ransom can be sent to a target organization with no actual investment or prior attack.\nAs the healthcare industry continues to implement new networked technologies deeper into day-to-day operations, and as attackers understand how this expands their attack footprint, IT and security practitioners need to take another look at the availability threats (such as DDoS) and reassess their strategies for protection and mitigating impacts.\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Healthcare\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\', \'securi', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/07/early-attack-activity-healthcare-security/');

These websites are increasingly becoming the target of DDoS attacks for a number of reasons. First, they are mainly targeted by extortionists, but they are also experiencing attacks from competition and user aggression.\nBitcoin-related sites attract a lot of attention and demand from their users, but this also plays against them. This dedicated user base requires instant access and live updates about market conditions and the current value of Bitcoin. When these services go down, thousands of users are left locked out of their accounts, which can result in reputation damage or financial loss for their users. This is also why extortionists choose to target these sites; not only do they have Bitcoin on hand, but some are not willing to go offline even for a moment due to the fear of losing clients.\n\n\nThis year we have already seen a number of Bitcoin start-ups shut down due to persistent denial of service campaigns and data breaches. Coinkite Inc, a secure wallet service, was reported to have been the victim of a 3-year DDoS campaign that started one month after they launched in 2012.

Managed services can help organizations focus on business strategies, conserve funds and resources, mitigate risks, and maintain, operate, and deploy environments. In recent years, however, the IT industry has come to a crossroad where managed services meet security. With the current threats of cyber hacks and intrusion methods being what they are, security is as important – or perhaps more important – to system owners as any other advantages they garner from a managed service provider. While championing the incomparable value correlated with having a powerful and dependable infrastructure without having to manage it, enterprises now can – and do – feel the same about managed security services.\n\nManaged services with a security focus.\nThe IT security landscape is constantly evolving. It has to keep ahead of and deal with maliciously insistent and ever-changing cyber threats. Incidents of security infringements are sometimes inevitable – the consequences of which can be disastrous for an organization. However, with early detection practices and rapid response mechanisms, these breaches are avoidable. If an agency has a managed service provider in their corner, they will find themselves addressing security measures and combating threats with a more proactive style of prepared and responsive protection.\n\nImplementing and using defense layers.\nAs a managed service provider, BlackMesh, for example, has to maintain the highest levels of security for its customers. We do this through layered security, implementing multiple overlays of security controls to mitigate any potential issues. Each of these layers provide different types and degrees of security – all of which are necessary to keep customer data secure, and some of which are products for purchase. After network firewalls, our first line of defense for keeping our network secure is Radware’s DefensePro. This is an ideal security layer for combating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and accelerating Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) web-based protection. As a real-time Attack Mitigation System (AMS), this solution safeguards network infrastructure against downtime, vulnerability exploitation, malware, data theft, and targeted attacks. This is a big part of keeping ahead of the problem, and is crucial for any provider of managed services whose objective is security.\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation: Which is Right for Your Organization?]\nWith multiple layers of defense, alongside on-demand support for customers experiencing potential security breaches, BlackMesh can stop DDoS threats and ensure customer websites continue to operate smoothly. It’s important to remember that today, achieving the highest threat mitigation capabilities available – and keeping your network safe and secure – is imperative to success.\nThe need for compliance.\nWith rising security threats, the demand for improved security through compliance has been augmented – and in many cases, embedded into today’s company culture. As a result of the aforementioned evolving threats to IT security, increasingly strict compliance requirements have become part of almost every industry. Security concerns and subsequent regulations affect education, government, healthcare, finance, and even nonprofit organizations, and, in effect, these same concerns and regulations pertain to manages service providers. In fact, BlackMesh hosts several platforms that require specific security standards in order to function. These standards include Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Department of Defense (DoD) Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Impact Level 2, and Statement of Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 compliance. The quality and quantity of compliance standards available to managed service providers is a testament to both the threats to security that exist and the magnitude of the measures being taken to combat them.\nFedRAMP, for example, is a program that stems from a direct need for the federal government to address specific security needs and progress into the era of cloud computing. Since most federal agencies have not yet attained cloud technologies, they require secure platforms to reduce the annual legacy IT costs and accommodate the projected exponential growth of data requirements. A push to cloud is essential for achieving the highest degree of security for government information. This is why the government established the Cloud First policy – the initiative encourages federal agencies to utilize cloud-based alternatives for system infrastructure in consideration of cost, resiliency, resources, and security. With this cloud directive implemented, efforts to ensure agencies and contractors comply with FedRAMP is passed down to the managed service provider.\nBusiness continuity means security.\nAchieving compliance with various industry standards is just one component of what an organization really needs to properly address security threats. Continuously smooth and efficient access to and availability of critical data is fundamental to protecting what matters. Business continuity plans relevant to IT solutions are as essential for all industries and enterprises as network security. In alignment with a general security and/or compliance plan, a good managed service provider will work with their clients to develop a sufficient disaster recovery strategy. The service provider can utilize multiple datacenter locations to house client solutions and guarantee uninterrupted IT services during long-term outages. By also offering a failover location and off-site backups, providers can help system owners meet continuity of operations, disaster recovery, and compliance requirements.\n [You might also like: Dry Lighting Cracks Against the Cloud: The Rise of Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)]\nContinuing to evolve and adapt.\nAs networks come under new threats, the means of disrupting these efforts must evolve. Cyber-attacks are persistent. Hackers devise new methods of getting data and rendering websites inaccessible. These techniques get more brazen by the day. Luckily, means of preventing and protecting against such threats are often equally – if not more – sophisticated and dependable. Having the right managed service provider means an optimal level of security through compliance, innovative technologies, and continuity measures. A managed service provider that can adapt to security variations can undoubtedly bolster security – and that’s what everyone needs.\n \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Denial of Service\', \'dos attack\', \'protection\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/adaptive-managed-services-bolster-security/');

The continuous pressure to protect increasingly sensitive data and systems that are decreasingly under direct control from a rapidly advancing threat landscape is enough to keep any CIO/CISO up at night. The challenges and intensities of this role make the input and perspective of those executives that fill it of particular interest and relevance as a factor of the evolving security landscape. Recognizing the weight of this audience’s perspective, we recently conducted a survey of more than 200 C-level security executives from the U.S. and United Kingdom to probe on recent and forthcoming trends and their likely impacts. The findings reveal some consistencies and some variance across geographies and when compared to the inputs of security practitioners deeper within their organizations.\n\nThe results of this survey have recently been published in the report “2016 Executive Application and Network Security.” Here are some of the key findings from the study, all of which you can read more about in the full report.\n\nOn the Executive Agenda\nNot surprisingly, the seemingly endless stream of news about high profile attacks and breaches, combined with the heavy penalties (financial or otherwise) that follow, the topic of cyber-security is not a standard element of board meeting agendas. In fact, 82% of respondents to our survey confirm that the highest levels of executives are now fully abreast of security risks and mitigation strategies. There was very little variance on this topic across industries, which highlights that the idea that only certain verticals (finance, retail) are highly sensitive is no longer true.\nWe do start to see some differing views when we dig deeper into the impacts of cyber-attacks, particularly by geography. Our U.K. based respondents showed a much higher sensitivity to the potential of lost contracts (20% vs. 10% in the U.S.) whereas the U.S. respondents put more emphasis on brand reputational damage and productivity loss than their U.K. counterparts.\n [You might also like: Ransom, Ransom Everywhere]\nIncreased Risks Means Increased Investment\nThe role of security vendor faces some of the similar challenges as the security executive, though the former is also the beneficiary of increased spending by the latter. Two-thirds of respondents reported increases in cyber-security spending since last year, ranging from 10%-59%. One of the more surprising (maybe alarming) aspects of the survey was the lack of good awareness on spending amounts at the executive level. Over 50% of those surveyed acknowledged that they did not know exactly how much money and time their company was spending on security. If the spending increases remain an ongoing trend, this is sure to change over time.\n\nResponding to Ransom Attacks\nIf you’ve paid any attention to the cyber-security threat landscape recently, you’re no doubt aware of the rash of ransom motivated attacks against a variety of targets. We could see the early signs of this in our 2015-2016 Global Application & Network Security Report, which showed a growth in ransom as motivation for attackers—which nearly doubled from 16% in 2014 to 25% in 2015.  In one of the more interesting dynamics in the research, we found many executives “talk tough” when it comes to dealing with ransom attacks, but behave quite differently when faced with one. Specifically, 84% of respondents who had not been targeted by a ransom attack said they would not pay the ransom. Yet, when we asked those that had been targeted how they actually responded, the number of those that paid jumped to 43%, and was especially high in the U.K. where 64% report paying the ransom.\nAmong the other topics and trends explored in this research are how executives are dealing with the emerging risks posed by the Internet of Things (IoT), the impact of trading partners on security and vulnerability, and the idea of tapping into white/gray hat hackers as a means of improving security operations. Each area yielded recognition that the changes going on within and around companies are forcing new approaches and strategies for defense.\nFinally, the report also provides some perspectives on best practices in response to specific inputs garnered through the survey. Some of these include increasing visibility into outbound network traffic, improving security spending awareness, tips on dealing with ransom attacks, and also stressing the importance of leveraging automation in security operations.\nFor those sitting in the increasingly heated seat of the security executive, or for those just wanting to get better insights into their thinking, the “2016 Executive Application and Network Security” report provides a good starting point.\n\nRead “Security and the C-Suite: Threats and Opportunities” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Ransom\', \'Ransomware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/new-research-on-c-suite-security-mindset/');

They are presented with unique threats and challenges that most organizations do not have to deal with. Every year schools see thousands of new students that bring with them an arsenal of potentially vulnerable devices. To add to this growing complexity, most college campuses have migrated to digital platforms like Blackboard and Moodle. These online web portals are prime targets for denial of service attacks.\n\nMost colleges now-a-days use web portals for submission of assignments and tests. These portals are usually powered by Blackboard or Moodle, a learning management system. This technology is great and streamlines work flow, but presents a larger issue if knocked offline. If these portals go down, they prevent students from being able to submit their work. This is a huge issue with schools going digital. Schools are quick to incorporate the newest technology without considering the risk they present. Assignments are all submitted digitally, and a denial of service attack can block access to these portals. To add to the frustration, some teachers who do not understand the new technology or do not wish for it to be incorporated into the school system will take it out on innocent students by not granting extensions for the due date.\n\nNot only is the threat of denial of service attacks on schools growing but they are also becoming targets for cyber criminals and nation states who are looking to exfiltrate personally identifiable information (PII), research material and other crucial data found on college networks. Schools need to secure their networks before they continue to expand their services. Technology can be a wonderful learning aid and time saver for the educational system, but if the network is not properly secured they will face greater issues and delays than before they implement the new digital services.\nOne of the biggest security risks that a school network faces is from their students and the devices they bring on to campus every year. Students bring a considerably large amount of devices to college with them, ranging from personal computers and tablets to cell phones and gaming consoles. These devices all connect to the schoolâs network and present a large range of vulnerabilities that come with them. The activities that some students engage in, such as online gaming, can also bring a risk of malware or even denial of service attacks.\n [You might also like: Cyber Attack Market Place]\nAttacks can range from flooding the network to stealing data. The attackers can leave college campuses without a connection for days, or steal yearsâ worth of private research. Attacks spike at the beginning of every school year in the summer. Students have been known to DoS networks to game the registration system, which is all online today, or attack web portals used to submit assignments in the attempt to buy more time.\nRecently a handful of schools in the United States have become the victims of denial of service attacks, most notably Rutgers University. Rutgers has close to 65,000 undergraduate students that rely on daily access to the schoolâs web portal. Rutgers Universityâs Computer Science Department is also ranked 34th in the country, yet they have been the repeated victim of a hacker that goes by the name Exfocus. This hacker has claimed the responsibility of carrying out six separate attacks on Rutgers University. These attacks have left the school networks paralyzed and students demanding answers to where the money for improvements was spent.\nItâs expected that school networks will increasing be targeted in the future. Radwareâs 2015-2016 Global Application & Network Security Report predicted this increase in cyber attacks against educational institutes. This trend also corresponds to the growing variety of powerful attack tools available for novice attackers found on the Darknet.\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'college\', \'cyberattack\', \'Denial of Service\', \'dos attack\', \'Education\', \'Hackers\', \'university\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/school-networks-getting-hacked-is-it-the-students-fault/');

There are volumes of cautionary tales and vast, virtual graveyards of “products looking for a problem to solve.” Often, these come about when vendors look across their technology portfolio and identify logical interactions that only they can see. Other times they occur through overzealous business development efforts, a sort of unfortunate “you got your chocolate in my peanut butter” scenario where the result tastes anything but sweet.\n\nBut there are certainly examples where the combination of technologies delivers on unique value propositions. And sometimes those initially to a smaller segment of certain markets, those on the leading edge of pushing new requirements, often the result of being among the first targeted with advanced threats. Such is the story of the intersection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) technology, an area of intense concentration for the Radware team for some time.\n\nWe have customers that have been enjoying the benefits of coordinated attack protection across these technologies for many years, but last week at the Gartner Security & Risk Summit in Washington, D.C. this particular intersection got a big boost in focus and attention through a committed analyst session on the topic.\nAs has been the case for the past several years, the Gartner Security & Risk Summit provided a highlight to the early summer security events schedule. The annual collection of analysts, vendors and practitioners once again brought to the surface many new and important topics and discussions around cyber-security. The usual topics of cloud, APT and vendor comparison were featured on a full agenda that also took close looks at things like insider threats, information sharing and vendor collaboration.\nLeading up to the event, I reviewed the entire agenda to decide which sessions I needed to attend, and one particular session jumped off the pages for me. Lawrence Orans and Jeremy D’Hoinne, leading analysts in the areas of DDoS protection and WAF respectively, co-presented in a session titled “Protecting Your Website Against DDoS and Other Threats.” The focus of the session was largely around this intersection of DDoS and WAF, a fact that we naturally see as full validation that the market is now in-tune with the importance of coordination across these technologies to provide successful protection from today’s complex, coordinated attacks.\n [You might also like: Why WAF & DDoS – A Perfect Prearranged Marriage – #2]\nOne some level, the session was neat to see just in terms of having these two lead analysts together on-stage validating the intersection. The session also had a number of strong points and highlights, in particular the focus on “getting beyond the yes/no” when discussing capabilities and features with vendors. In other words, when you ask a vendor if they can do A, B and C, don’t take them at their word or base it on their marketing materials. Actually vet their capabilities in these areas.\nWhy is this so important?\nWell, as the session highlighted, there are any number of solutions that can address the run-of-the-mill attack tools and scripts. But an increasing number of attacks cannot be blocked by the common reputational databases and/or static signature databases. Specifically, the session referenced that 10% of attacks get past these types of security functions, enough that should concern anyone serious about security.\nThere was one aspect of the session that I had some disagreement with, related to the level of technical integration between some of the bundled solutions. The basic message here was that today, most of the vendors offering a bundling of DDoS mitigation and WAF capabilities offer more of a ‘marketecture’ type bundle that has the benefits of vendor consolidation, streamlining procurement and also offering some price breaks on the combination of services. Also discussed was some basic capabilities around coordinated visibility across the services.\nWhile true for many of the vendors highlighted in the session, this perspective actually overlooks an area of huge investment (and customer value) for Radware. Our technologies for both DDoS and WAF feature what we refer to as ‘Defense Messaging,’ a robust communication that’s much deeper than typical health checks or simple signals to include intricate details about DDoS attacks, normal traffic, or changes to applications. All of this helps our solutions increase effectiveness against the growing number of attacks that will leverage multiple vectors across application and network attacks to circumvent protections.\nIn a twist of irony, I am the guy that often briefs these analysts on our capabilities, so really this means I need to do a better job of educating them on this feature.

That’s over a half a billion emails and usernames up for grabs! This is a gold mine for hackers. Researchers are not the only ones that obtain and analyze leaked databases. Often times, hackers will keep databases for themselves so they can conduct malicious activity with the credentials.\n\nBut what if the hackers do not wish to use the data? If the hacker’s intention is to profit from the data, they will usually list it for sale on a number of different Darknet markets. While there are a number of items that one can find on the Darknet, in this blog I will be talking about buying and selling items related to fraud.  \nFraud has always been a big business for hackers, but now they have semi-legitimate markets where they can publicly sell their stolen goods. On a number of different Darknet sites, you can purchase anything from accounts & bank drops, to data dumps, personal information and credit cards. Most of the time you don’t even have to look that hard to find them.\n\nTheRealDeal (a Darknet market) has been very popular lately. This is the marketplace where the hacker, Peace of Mind, has been selling old databases that have never been publicly released. On this site, the hacker or hackers behind this account are selling user credentials for a fraction of a cent. For just a few Bitcoins, you can own over 100 million usernames and password. This is huge. Most people today still reuse old passwords and have the same login credentials across multiple platforms. An attacker can use this data set in an attempt to take control of another personal account to gain even more information, or they can use the email list for large scale phishing campaigns. \n\nAnother item that you can find on the Darknet is personal information, including PayPal accounts, credit cards, identification and Social Security numbers.  I find this very concerning. You can purchase “Fullz,” which is carder slang for full personal package. A full package of data includes first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, e-mail, DOB, IP address, phone number and SSN. The sad truth is a Fullz package goes for as little as .0008 BTC or around 45-50 cents per record. Some CCV vendors also sell cloned credit cards with PIN numbers provided by professional skimmers. These clones are mainly VISA and MasterCard accounts and can even be used at ATMs. One vendor sells clone cards individually.  One card with a $5,000 guarantee can sell for as little as .40 Bitcoin, or around $200.\n [You might also like: How Mark Zuckerberg’s LinkedIn, Twitter and Pinterest Accounts were Compromised]\n\nYou can even purchase hacking services to hijack accounts and steal personal information. There are a number of sites on the Darknet that offer Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Gmail hacking services. These services normally sell for around .5 Bitcoin, or $250. If you want to steal information off of a website or server via an SQL injection, the price varies but usually starts around 1 Bitcoin or $500.\n\nThe Darknet can be a very scary thing when it comes to fraud. Fraud takes up a large section of most markets. Almost every marketplace has a fraud category that is loaded with fresh credit cards and personal information. \nIn the long run, there is not much you can do to stop this activity. Fraud has and always will be a cornerstone for hackers. The Darknet has only provided them with a market to sell their goods with some layer of protection. However, the Darknet is not the only place that you can find this kind of information. Sites like TorCrds also sell stole credit card number on the Clearnet.\n\nIn the end, it really comes down to your personal security. First and foremost, always be on alert for phishing emails. Recently, PhishMe reported that 93% of phishing emails contain ransomware, but phishing emails are also designed to steal information from unwary users. In addition to this, it’s also recommended to monitor your credit and bank statements, keep your system up to date with the latest updates and patches, use strong passwords and use 2 factor authentication when possible. You should also disable any file sharing services not in use. While browsing, be careful where and who you give your personal information to. Always verify the company that you are doing business with and always use encryption. If you store personal data and files on your computer, consider using encrypted file storage. \nIn the end, if you suspect that you are a victim of fraud, report it to the authorities right away. You can also file a complaint with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, IC3.\nAdditional information can be found at:\nhttps://www.usa.gov/online-safety\nhttp://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'fraud\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/fraud-on-the-darknet/');

This strategy involves getting the right players on the field, with a complementary set of skills that will provide a team with the right mix of capabilities.  In deploying security products into your IT environment, you are looking for the right mix of solutions (security monitoring, protection, analysis, analytics and response capabilities) in order to cover the field.  Deploying an effective and efficient set of security solutions will provide you maximum benefits, with improved operational efficiencies and costs.\n\nBut how do you find the right set of players?\n\nHere are some key ingredients for fielding the right team:\n\nPrevention is Mandatory. Traditional methods of prevention have often failed, leaving many to believe detection is the only way forward. This is a dangerous proposition. \nSecurity Intelligence is the Underpinning. Specialized knowledge in one domain is not enough. It takes enterprise-wide visibility and maximum use of data to stop today’s threats.\nIntegration Enables Protection. The best defense is relentless improvement. Technologies must seamlessly integrate with processes and people across the entire life cycle of attacks. \nOpenness must be embraced. Security teams need the ability to share context and invoke actions between communities of interest and numerous new and existing security investments. \n\nLet’s examine how we can select security solutions that will provide a good mix of capabilities and provide the above elements.  In this example, we will focus on protecting our applications from denial of service and web based attacks.  We will need to proactively monitor and analyze our network and application traffic to discover these attacks and raise a security event if suspicious behavior is found.  We will want to cover the first point and deploy a security solution for discovery, and report on these types of attacks. \n [You might also like: Buy Me Some Peanuts and Database Hacks]\nFor the second point, we will need to deploy an SIEM to enable correlation of these security events, as there will be a very large number of events throughout our enterprise. We will need to filter, correlate and prioritize these events so that our operations team is not flooded can focus on a clearer set of security incidents.  These tools are key players in our threat protection system.  But we must be careful about how we select these products.  If they do not provide integration and share context, we will struggle with interpreting these individual products’ user interfaces, detailed analysis and individual viewpoints, and suffer longer operational response times as a result.  \nLet’s take a look at Radware DefensePro, Appwall and IBM QRadar SIEM. These products provide a focus on the importance of ensuring strong integration capabilities. The integration of our DDoS products (DefensePro) and Web Application Firewall (Appwall) into the IBM QRadar SIEM enables joint customers to correlate the events of these network or application attacks with other information and events across the enterprise. This is an increasingly critical capability as we see the growth of complex attack campaigns with DDoS tactics or application logic attacks that don’t work alone, but rather as a part of broader wave of attacks with multiple TTPs. \nThis focus on integration supports what we would call automated attack lifecycle management – a minimization of the need for humans to do information or event correlation and instead focus their energy towards strategic security decisions that balance threat with risk and response.  Fight bots with bots, we would say . . . allow the automated security technologies that are tuned to the pace of the threat landscape to make initial policy changes, and apply the human decision making process at a higher level.\n\n For more information, visit our IBM Technology Partnership page.\n\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'ddos\', \'Denial of Service\', \'security monitoring\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/cover-your-bases/');

In fact, there came a time when some even wanted to leverage them or use them for their own personal gain. One of these was an Anonymous person who always wore a black and pearly white mask with white facial features drawn upon it. In fact, this Anonymous person was a ruse, as in the end it was not a single person, but many who dressed the same and fought the big, big company nearly as one. However, the many were indistinguishable from the one.\nAs stories grew of successful attacks on neighbors, the big, big company grew fearful of this Anonymous creature and began to implement security throughout the organization. The security responsibility was gifted to three very trustworthy employees who divided the organization into three constructs, and each had their own model they would employ against these Anonymous creatures.\n\n \nThe first employee was named Alpha. He was strong and determined not to let any nefarious actor into his domain as his was the first. His brawn convinced everyone that in order to accomplish this goal, he would need to have control over nearly every security device and all surveillance. He employed a security model which required zero tolerance for risks. This model was very tight and very intrusive. He used many tools and systems and set forth building an enormous infrastructure to see, review, escalate and mitigate any and all threats. Nothing entered, transited or exited his domain without his knowledge and express permission.\n \n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\nThe second employee was named Beta. Beta was known for his intellect and ability to get along with others. He believed that in order for great security to occur that oppression need not be implemented, and the environment needed to live with ‘some’ risks. The\nidea was to have superior coding, sourcing, and training processes and policies. Through the living heartbeat of security, there was less of a need for a lot of tools and more reliance on people and process. Beta set forth in his domain to attempt to secure nearly 90% of the environment as the rest was either achievable or too costly to control, however he used process and policy to rule his roost and kept a watchful eye for Anonymous.\n \n\nThe last employee was called Omega. He protected the last domain of the organization. He was neither particularly strong nor intelligent, but he was physically agile and amicable and made lasting friends easily. The idea was to have a jovial and open environment where people felt free to alert him to issues which either were occurring or have occurred and deal with them mostly after the fact. Like Beta, Omega set forth in his domain to attempt to secure nearly 90% of the environment as the rest was either achievable or too costly to control, however he placed his security fundamentally with people convinced they were best suited for Anonymous.\n \nThen one day, Anonymous came to Alpha. He huffed and puffed as he powered his new hacking tool, which exploited unknown vulnerabilities within the vendor community entrusted with his defense. In the end, the unknowns were more numerous than the knowns and unknowns and took his domain down.\nA day later, Beta came under attack. Although his system of processes, policies and procedures was working well, they just didn’t anticipate the speed in which Mr. Anonymous could attack. He was like a machine with lightning-fast tactics and inhuman type of adjustments. Having never witnessed a robot (or bot- like) attack, Beta was no match with human processes against bot-like attacks.\nFinally Omega came under attack, and he was the last hope for the whole big, big company. At first Omega’s plan worked like a charm, where people were ‘on their game’, positive, attentive and effective. However as Mr. Anonymous’ attack lasted much, much, much longer than anyone ever imagined, Omega’s team began to tire, mental acuity and dexterity diminished and emotions running high. Eventually Omega’s teams of powerful people were victimized also.\nIn the end, the CEO of the big, big, company capitulated and asked Mr. Anonymous what he could have done to have put up an effective defense. Mr. Anonymous replied that security isn’t about technology alone, or process alone, or people alone, but it’s about all three acting together. Mr. Anonymous continued that should Alpha, Beta and Omega have resided in all three domains – he would never have been able to match the challenge. However, lucky for him, the world is filled with either Alphas, Betas or Omegas alone!\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anonymous\', \'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'fairytale\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/cybersecurity-fairytale/');

I never thought it would be the man that runs the biggest online social network in the world.  Mark Zuckerberg had his personal accounts compromised via the LinkedIn leak that was sold on the Darknet marketplace, The Real Deal, by a vendor named Peace of Mind.\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s information was found in the LinkedIn leak by a group of hackers from Saudi Arabia called OurMine. To make things worse, Zuckerberg’s password was not only weak but it was also reused across a number of platforms. In the end, Mr. Zuckerberg had his Twitter and Pinterest accounts compromised. The password in question was ‘dadada’. Ouch. You would have assumed that someone like Mark Zuckerberg would have been a little more careful when it came to securing his personal accounts. But have no fear Facebook users, even Facebook doesn’t find ‘dadada’ as an acceptable password.\n\nConsidering the number of leaks that have occurred over the last few weeks, I figured this would be a good time to revisit password hygiene. \nFirst, when you are creating a new account, try not to use the same username and password over and over again. This is a bad habit. If you use a separate username and password for each account, you will dramatically reduce your risk of having multiple accounts hijacked at once due to credential reuse.  Another important thing to consider when creating a secure password is where you will store it. It’s difficult to remember multiple usernames and passwords, so I would suggest using a password manager like 1Password or LastPass to manage all of your accounts. I would also recommend that you change these passwords every 60-90 days.\n [You might also like: Fraud on the Darknet: How to Own Over 1 Million Usernames and Passwords]\nWhile browsing, make sure the site is encrypted and look for “HTTPS” before entering your information. Never let your browser store your information. Attackers can use tools like ChromePass and WebBroswerPassView to extract stored data and access your accounts. If your site offers two step authentication (2FA), I suggest that you enable this feature. For a list of services that offer 2FA visit: https://twofactorauth.org/\n\nBelow are a few general guidelines on how to create a secure password. When creating one, aim for a minimum password length of 14 characters.\n Passwords should contain all of the following:\n•	lower case letters (i.e. a-z)\n•	upper case letters (i.e. A-Z)\n•	numbers (i.e. 0-9)\n•	special characters (e.g. )(*&^%$#@!)\nDo not:\n•	use personal information\n•	use common words found in a dictionary\n•	use repeating characters\n•	use default passwords\nExercise caution when using Open Authorization, OAuth, for application logins.  Some services require you to log in to their service with a Facebook account, like Tinder, but other services like Feedly give you an option. When given the option, avoid the OAuth login to prevent cross-contamination on multiple accounts.\nOne of the common arguments I hear from users when I recommend that they change their password habits is their accounts do not contain anything personal, like bank statements or account numbers. For the most part they are correct, but to a hacker there is more to harvest.  For example, under Twitter settings you can find the IP login history under the tab “Your Twitter Data”. This information can be leveraged to discover more information about your location. If you have your cell phone number attached to the account, they can also see this and use it against you. Every data point counts for a hacker, and the idea is to prevent them from gathering information about you. You should practice secure password hygiene to prevent the attacker from pivoting to another account. \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'data leak\', \'Hackers\', \'password protection\', \'password security\', ', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/06/trio-is-not-an-expert-on-password-security/');

The main questions to be asked as we move forward are as follows:\n–	 If physical terror has played such a major role in aviation accidents, can cybersecurity sabotage be far behind?\n–	What controls / testing are done to ensure the ongoing operations of jets that rely increasingly on computers are safe and sound?\n–	What personnel controls are placed on those conducting tests and coding for these aviation systems?\nLet’s take a look at EgyptAir’s history and you can be the judge if we have potential future risk.\n\nEgyptAir Flight 804 Loss in Mediterranean Sea, May 2016\nWith the loss of EgyptAir’s Flight 804 from Paris to Cairo, we’ve already begun to learn a lot lessons about the state of the aviation industry’s security apparatus. Questions now linger about terror’s human factor in piloting, maintaining and otherwise accessing these aircraft.  \nIn fact, even if this flight accident is deemed a mechanical or geo-political accident (e.g. a missile shoot-down like Malaysian Airlines incident over the Ukraine), it still leaves EgyptAir with nearly a 50/50 chance over the past 20 years of data of an accident originating from terrorism versus mechanical failure, according to statistics from aviation-saftey.net\nThen we have the Islamic State, which issued a chilling threat to ‘kill France’ just days before EgyptAir flight MS804 from Paris vanished with 66 people on board. Only days before the disappearance, ISIS gave a murderous warning to France in an online video. The message gives no other clues and seems to give a hint that a convert joined ISIS and was ready to give punishment to the French. Although most of the casualties are Muslim Egyptians, this threat has not been confirmed to link to the crash yet as investigation continues. Also, ISIS does not care about killing Muslims since their code allows it.\n [You might also like: Cybersecurity in the Real World: 4 Examples of the Rise of Public Transportation Systems Threats]\nEgyptAir Flight 181, Hijacked, March 2016\nEgyptAir Flight 181, a domestic flight from Alexandria to Cairo, was hijacked by a male passenger in March 2016. The aircraft, an Airbus A320, departed Alexandria-Borg El Arab Airport (HBE) about 06:30 and was in descent towards Cairo International Airport when it was hijacked. The aircraft turned to the left and headed north, and an uneventful landing was carried out at Larnaca Airport, Cyprus. The hijacker who was arrested claimed to have an explosive belt, however released all occupants except for the pilot, co-pilot, three cabin crew members and three passengers before being taken into custody.\nEgyptAir Flight 738, Hijacked, October 2009\nA Sudanese passenger on board the EgyptAir flight pulled a knife on a female attendant just minutes after takeoff, saying he wanted the flight diverted to Jerusalem “to liberate it.” Two air marshals overpowered the hijacker, who later turned out to be intoxicated. News media reported the airplane involved to be a Boeing 737 while the EgyptAir timetable suggested the airplane usually used on that flight was an Airbus A320.\nEgyptAir Flight 233, Hijacked, May 2000\nA man brandished a jar of hair gel and claimed it to be a bomb on board EgyptAir flight 233. The hijacker told the chief flight attendant that he wanted to go to Afghanistan so that he could find a job. After making the demand, the hijacker attempted to storm the cockpit of the Airbus A321 aircraft but was unable to gain entry and was overpowered by crew members. The plane landed in Aswan, where the hijacker was taken into custody and charged with air piracy and threatening the lives of airplane passengers. None of the 19 people on the flight were injured.\nEgyptAir Flight 990 loss near Nantucket Island, MA, October 1999\nEgyptAir Flight 990 departed Los Angeles International Airport, destined for Cairo, with a scheduled intermediate stop at New York-JFK airport. Two designated flight crews (each crew consisting of a captain and first officer) boarded the aircraft at JFK.  After takeoff and leveling off at 33,000 feet four minutes later, the command captain decided to go to the toilet and left the flight deck.  About 21 seconds after the captain left the cockpit, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) picked up the relief first officer quiet statement of “I rely on God.” Shortly thereafter, the autopilot was disconnected and once again the relief first officer stated quietly, “I rely on God.”  Again, shortly thereafter, the engine throttle levers were moved from their cruise power setting to idle, and, one second later, the flight deck recorder (FDR) recorded an abrupt nose-down elevator movement and a very slight movement of the inboard ailerons. Subsequently, the airplane began to rapidly pitch nose-down and descend. The relief first officer quietly repeated, “I rely on God,” seven additional times. \n [You might also like: 4 Reasons to Believe that Future Cyber Attacks Will Terrorize]\nDuring this time, as a result of the nose-down elevator movement, the airplane’s load factor decreased from about 1 to about 0.2 G (almost weightlessness). Then the elevators started moving further in the nose-down direction. Immediately thereafter the captain entered the flight deck and asked loudly, “What’s happening? What’s happening?” As the airplane’s load factor reached negative G loads (about -0.2 G) the relief first officer stated for the tenth time, “I rely on God.” As the airplane exceeded its maximum operating airspeed (0.86 Mach), a master warning alarm began to sound and the relief first officer stated quietly for the eleventh and final time, “I rely on God,” and the captain repeated his question, “What’s happening?” The US National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the EgyptAir Flight 990 accident was the airplane’s departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean, as a result of the relief first officer’s flight control inputs. The reason for the relief first officer’s actions “was not determined.”\nSummary\nAviation terror threats, like water, tend to take the path of least resistance.   When thumbs are stuck in the dike new holes are made where the foundation is most weak.   We now know through numerous external analysis and documented evidence that the aviation sector is vulnerable to cyberattacks.   How long will it be before the terror strikes will evolve in the aviation industry, like they did around the world, to the cyber front?

The benefit of securing our communication is obvious; however, the encrypted communication does have its downside.\n\nTo understand the downside, let’s see how the HTTPS communication is secured. In very simple terms, there are two keys, one available to everyone, called a public key and the other available to the recipient of the communication, called a private key. When you want to send encrypted communication to someone, you use their public key to secure that communication channel. Once secured, this communication can only be decrypted by the recipient who has the private key. \n\n\nSo, in normal usage, for example, let’s say you want to check your bank account. You’d use your browser to go to your online banking site; the communication channel you establish from you to your bank is secured with the bank’s public key. Your bank maintains its private key securely and is able to decrypt your request with their private key, verify you as a legitimate user and grant you access. From then on, all your communication on this channel is secure. There may be additional security procedures enabled as well.\nThe same mechanism of encryption using a public key can be used by malicious users/programs to gain access to sensitive information.\n [You might also like: Fraud on the Darknet: How to Own Over 1 Million Usernames and Passwords]\nSo, how can this happen? Consider a few scenarios: You inadvertently opened an infected file from someone possibly known to you, your computer was infected through a USB card that you shared, or through a malware that was embedded in some productivity program you downloaded.\nWhen the malware activates, it may open an encrypted session to an external server. The only information the malware requires to secure the communication with the external server is the external server’s public key. Since the sending user/program’s organization does not have the private key to this encrypted communication, it’s unable to decipher this session and thus is blind to any information that’s being sent outside.\nAs usage of encrypted traffic increases, this challenge will become more pervasive. We are already beginning to see such cyber-attacks on many organizations for financial gain and for access to valuable confidential data.\nMany traffic inspection solutions such as data leakage prevention (DLP), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and firewalls may not have the ability to decrypt encrypted traffic, and therefore are blind to cyber threats initiated from within the organization to external servers. Even when they have the ability to decrypt, the ability comes with a performance impact, making these systems less scalable and thus un-economical.\nThe key to protecting against such attacks is to inspect SSL traffic. So, how does the SSL traffic inspection work?\nThe SSL inspection solution intercepts and decrypts SSL sessions destined to outside servers. For internal users/programs, these SSL inspection systems appear as the intended external server and for the recipient servers, the SSL inspection system appears as the user/program. The SSL inspection systems take advantage of the fact that the security is between two end points and not end-to-end. \nFor ease of deployment, SSL inspection systems may provide both transparent inspection without requiring the need to re-engineer the network or as explicit proxy that require all users  to pass through a predefined SSL proxy configured via a user’s browser.\n [You might also like: Carrier Market Addresses Privacy, Encryption and Security in Recent INCOMPASS Panel]\nThe decrypted traffic is then steered to any content inspection solution such as firewalls, anti-malware, or data leakage protection systems already deployed in the enterprise to check against an organization’s security policies. Sessions that pass the security inspection are then re-encrypted by the SSL inspection system and forwarded to its destination server. \nFor efficiency, some traffic may be sent through untouched if a particular site is trusted by the enterprise or is related to employee privacy (online banking, healthcare); others may be blocked for productivity reasons, typically online gaming or known malware servers.\nTo be secure yet cost-effective and efficient in gaining visibility to all encrypted traffic, it’s important to be selective in what encrypted traffic an organization decrypts. \nSince SSL decryption and re-encryption are computationally intensive operations and may impact latency, use best practices – hardware acceleration if you have a large number of users and encrypted traffic; be selective with decryption by using filtering and whitelists to bypass decryption for sites that you trust, and choose solutions that reduce the number of devices you require to scale and are cost-effective.\nFor more details on Radware solutions: SSL Based Attack Protection\n\nRead the ebook: “SSL Attacks on the Rise: Protective Technology Turned Attack Vector” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'load balancer security\', \'SSL inspection\', \'SSL security\', \'SSL visibility\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/05/is-your-data-secure-from-hackers/');

The true answer lies with a combination defense or, to coin a common security phrase, “defense-in-depth.”\n\n\nFirst of all, we cannot rely solely upon on-premises solutions because of the volumetric aspects of DDoS attacks. Most organizations cannot deal with multi-Gbps attacks because their connection lines will fill up, and then, game over. If they are using a CDN to help deal with the attack, then the attackers need only rotate the pages they are requesting to make caching in the CDN ineffectual because they are not requesting cached data. However, this is not to say that on-site defenses are not valid or viable. They have their place and are quite useful. I will come back to that later in the blog.\nNow to the larger question of, what about using a cloud-based or ISP-based scrubbing solution and why are they generally inadequate by themselves?\nFirst let’s look at ISP-based scrubbing. Excluding those ISPs that have third-party contracts with cloud providers and are therefore performing scrubbing services-in house via their own infrastructure, the first issue is the capacity of those providers varies greatly depending upon which one is used. If users are unlucky enough to be on an area of the backbone that is already near capacity or connected through a peer relationship from a smaller provider to a larger provider that area of the backbone is guaranteed to be overwhelmed when a volumetric DDoS attack hits.\n [You might also like: “POP” Goes the Vendor that Doesn’t Separate Scrubbing Centers from Always-On Platforms]\nAdditionally, even if the provider is able to handle the volume overall, if the performance impact to the other customers in the target’s network segment becomes sufficient, based on the providers internal metrics, the ISP reserves the right to protect the other customers, which generally means all of the traffic that could be DDoS is routed into a DNS black hole at the closest ingress or peering point the ISP maintains. The issue with that is, with the diversity of IP address across mobile and conventional devices, legitimate business traffic is guaranteed to get caught in the filtering. ISP’s are built to route packets from A to B. They are not generally equipped to scrutinize packets to identify application-based, multi-vector, and other more sophisticated attacks. Many enterprises use multiple ISPs and in these instances the challenge of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks adds another layer of complexity and vulnerability to ISP based only DDoS protection.\nSecond, while no one will argue that the major cloud-based scrubbing vendors have the capacity to deal with huge volumes of traffic and in fact those educated in the area of DDoS wholly support the use of those cloud services for bulk defense, most if not all of the experts not affiliated with a cloud service will agree that they often have limitation in other areas. One of the largest difficulties they have is discerning between legitimate traffic and application level DDoS attack traffic. Application DDoS traffic does not rely on the brute force of volumetric DDoS, but more finesse centered on how the application receives and processes data. By targeting weak points in the application design or the implementation architecture, a devastating result can be achieved with far less traffic that in many cases falls below levels that would trigger detection and response from a cloud service.\nWithout advanced IP-agnostic technologies neither an ISP nor a cloud vendor will be equipped to deal with Dynamic IP and bot attacks. This puts customers subscribing to those services for embedded DDoS protection at a significant disadvantage.\nSo where does that leave organizations threatened by or concerned about DDoS attacks? It leaves them looking at a hybrid solution. The ISP or cloud-based service is carefully chosen to meet the organization’s needs to provide the bulk filtering and then the on-premises solution is implemented to identify and filter the targeted attacks such as multi-vector/blended, application, encryption, dynamic IP and Bot attacks. With 35% of DDoS attack victims being targeted with encryption-based attacks and 37% being targeted with and ransom-based motives, customers relying on DDoS protection services not specifically designed to address the breadth of attacks being delivered will be at a significant disadvantage.\nIn this defense-in-depth strategy, premier cloud and ISP contracted services will filter out the large volumes, should they exist, using best practice techniques while the on-premises filtering finely scrutinizes the multi-vector, application, encryption, ransom, dynamic and bot –based attack traffic to allow the real business traffic to continue with little to no interruption in business. Even better is if/when the on-premises and the cloud service can communicate to improve each other’s filtering capabilities. This is a cutting edge “bonus” feature so the cloud service can be made aware of the start of a DDoS attack by the on-premises solution to initiate filtering before the traffic hits critical levels. In application attacks, the on-premises solution can send the cloud service information concerning the application and encrypted DDoS attack traffic it identifies so that the cloud can stop more bad traffic further from the target’s network.\n\n\nRead “7 Things to Look for in a Cloud Security Service” to learn more about how the expanded portfolio of cloud security services continuously adapts in step with evolving threats and ongoing development of applications.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'security\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/05/why-cloud-based-scrubbing-and-isp-based-scrubbing-alone-are-inadequate/');

Static cloud security services cannot help you win the web security game.  Only cloud security services that continuously and automatically adapt to the rapidly evolving threat landscape and protected assets can assure you are well prepared to anything that will be thrown at you… even as the rules continuously change!\n\n\nIn the web security arena, everything changes very fast.  The threat landscape rapidly evolves.  Zero-day attacks are launched on a daily basis, exploiting newly discovered vulnerabilities for which signature are not available yet. Attackers hide their attack vectors, and scraping bots hide their identities behind CDNs and dynamic IPs, avoiding any simple blacklisting technique trying to block them.  In such a rapidly evolving battleground, static cloud security services cannot protect you.  Static cloud security services utilize negative security models that identify attacks based on the signatures of attack vectors, and block attackers and bots using IP blacklisting mechanisms.  Unfortunately, that can’t help you with zero-day or dynamic IP attacks.   \nMeanwhile, the assets you need to protect are notoriously changing all the time, continuously introducing new vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers.  With static cloud security services, you have to tell whenever you launch new applications or introduce changes into existing ones, and manually change your security policies accordingly.  This manual process quickly gets out of control as developers that use continuous delivery methods launch release new versions on a daily basis.

All you need to do is to implement a cloud security service that continuously and automatically adapts to the evolving threat landscape and protected assets.  You can’t do that with static cloud security services.  To make sure you are continuously protected, you’ll need a cloud security service that implements a positive security model, which means it can tell what your legitimate traffic looks like, and then block anything else.  This would get you full protection from zero-day attacks, and from attacks using dynamic IP techniques.

In this blog, I’d like to talk specifically about what an attacker can purchase, and at what price.  You see, the entry point for cyber attackers keeps dropping as more vendors rush to sell their services on both the Darknet and the Clearnet.  Attackers can easily purchase a number of services such as undisclosed exploits and malware to botnets, bulletproof hosting and a number of other attack services. An attacker with limited skill can also purchase full service items that offer setup assistance for botnets and ransomware campaigns.  An attacker wishing to purchase attack tools is only limited by their budget, allowing those who can afford it instant access to some of the more sophisticated tools available today.\n\n\n\nHardly a day goes by that I don’t see a vendor advertising their services on Twitter or some other form of social media.  These advertisements are normally accompanied by a link to either a forum where they are selling their services, or a link to a paste site with additional information about the services they offer and where it can be purchased.  \n\n\nBotnets\nBotnet services are commonly found on both the Clearnet and the Darknet. Would-be attackers can purchase anything from tutorials on how to control and deploy their own to the malware itself.  If the purchaser does not care to learn about how to deploy their own botnet, they can purchase a setup service or even rent someone’s botnet temporarily. The average rental cost for a large botnet can cost between .025 – .05 BTC per hour and the malware itself can sell for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars. Some of the main functions found in these bots include DDoS attack via UDP, TCP, GET and POST floods along with the ability to emulate and bypass some JavaScript and cookie challenges.\n\n\n [You might also like: 5 Ways Hackers Market Their Products and Services]\nDDoS Attacks\nDDoS attacks can be purchased both on the Clearnet or the Darknet though a large majority of the DDoS service can be found on the Clearnet being sold as booter or stresser services. Notorious DDoS groups like Lizard Squad run their own public DDoS services. Lizard Squad’s current service is called Shenron.  Shenron offers eight packages ranging from as little as $19.99 to $999.99 a month. Attack times for these packages range from 1,200 to 18,000 seconds of boot time and the power behind the packages on Shenron allegedly range from 35Gbps to 500Gbps. Their services currently offer three different attack methods including DNS, SNMP, and SSYN. \n\n\nExploits\nOften Darknet marketplaces offer a number of exploit code for sale, like a local privilege escalation on Windows 8.1 or a single message DoS exploit on Telegram. You can also find exploits like a Remote Code Execution (RCE) that allows you to upload your bot to a large amount of vulnerable routers. These exploits can come with a high price tag though. The RCE exploit on the router is currently for selling for $2,500 and the Telegram 0day is selling for close to $5,000. If an attacker is willing to pay these prices, they can easily skip the line and quickly start creating havoc by building their own large botnet and launching attacks against their intended victims. \n\n\nRansomware\nRansomware is another popular item found in the attack marketplace. Ransomware is often sold in a variety of forms but ultimately requires the attacker to share some profits with the vendor or operator behind the campaign. For example, Ransom32 is selling on AlphaBay for $800. Once the attacker purchases the package from the vendor, they specify how much they want to ransom their victim for and give the vendor a Bitcoin address to send payments to. The vendor will then send the purchaser a malicious file that the attacker can send to their victims and give them access to a control panel where they can get daily updates about their current campaign and who has paid.\n\n\nThe attack marketplace is slowly allowing anyone and everyone to become an attacker if the price is right. For $19.99 a month an attacker can run attacks for 30 days, 1,200 seconds at a time utilizing multiple vectors of attack, or they can spend $1,000 and run their own botnet or ransomware campaign. This is ultimately shifting the scale of the attack landscape.  It doesn’t take much more than an idea, and some money, to carry out a large scale attack today. We are now seeing a breed of attackers who know nothing about hacking other than what site they need to go to and how much they need to spend to carry out the campaign they envision.  Those that have more money and less time to invest can immediately start their campaign without the need to learn about anything.  The more money you have to spend on attack services, the more you can accomplish without prior experience. \n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cyberattack\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'darknet marketplace\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/05/cyber-attack-market-place/');

Through providing protection of critical applications and services for some of the world’s best known online businesses, Radware has developed a highly relevant view on what threats pose the greatest risk, and what strategies for protection prove most successful. With these lessons in mind, we have prepared a checklist, of sorts, for security organizations looking to secure online transactions and service delivery.\n\nAlthough far from comprehensive for a full security strategy, here are some critical elements that can help address the threats becoming more commonplace for online businesses.\n1.	Protect against availability attacks\nGiven the clear and significant correlation between downtime and loss of revenue, avoiding outage resulting from availability attacks should be at the top of the list for any online business. With a wealth of sensitive data such as credit card numbers, it’s not uncommon for online businesses to be overly focused on data confidentiality and integrity. This is especially true for organizations that allow security compliance initiatives to dictate priorities. But with the growth in frequency and severity of DDoS attacks, proactive protection is a must.\n2.	Prepare for  encrypted attacks\nAttacks leveraging encrypted traffic as an attack vector are on the rise, further challenging many of the cyber-threat solutions currently in place. Most cyber-attack mitigation technologies do not actually inspect SSL traffic, as it requires decrypting the encrypted traffic. According to Radware’s 2014-2015 Global Network and Application Security Report, as much as 25% of attack activity today is using SSL-based attack vectors. Organizations should ensure they can address the needs of high capacity mitigation, support all common versions of SSL and TLS, and can isolate suspicious encrypted traffic using behavioral analysis to limit legitimate user impact.\n [You might also like: In the Crosshairs: Six Cyber Security Threats Gunning For Your Online Business]\n3.	Protect assets behind a CDN\nIt is common for online businesses to leverage Content Delivery Networks (CDN) to enhance web application performance. However, CDNs can also be exploited by attackers to launch, and even amplify attacks. Dynamic content attacks exploit CDN-based protection by overloading origin servers with requests for non-cached content that the CDN nodes simply pass along. When leveraging CDNs, teams should look carefully at the need for dedicated security protections to sit in front of origin servers.\n4.	Implement IP-agnostic protection\nMalicious actors have made an art form out of spoofing IP addresses to not only obfuscate their identity but possibly masquerading as seemingly legitimate users based on geo-location or positive reputational information about IP addresses they are able to compromise. Organizations should look for solutions that use device fingerprinting technology that employs various tools and methodologies to gather IP-agnostic information about the source.\n\n5.	Have a strategy for responding to ransom attacks\nBased on the 2015-2016 Radware Global Network and Application Security Report, there has been a 50% increase in ransom as a motivation for attackers. This increase grew from 16% in 2014 to 25% in 2015.  Online businesses make good targets for those looking to gain financially from attack, given the knowledge that the immediate revenue impact from an attack may spur these businesses to quickly pay the ransom. However, experience has shown that paying the ransom often leads to prolonged or repeat attacks. A better strategy is to turn the economic tables on attackers by making the business a more difficult target through strong security posture. Most important is that businesses proactively have a plan in place as reactively implementing a plan tends to be costly and less effective.\n6.	Consider the CAPEX and OPEC costs to processing unwanted traffic\nAs cyber threats continue to grow in size, complexity and duration, not only do they pose risks associated with data confidentiality, transactional integrity and platform availability, but also simply the costs that go into processing all of the unwanted data. Processing bad traffic into its data centers results in significant costs to any online business. Conversely, dropping malicious activity at the perimeter allows online businesses to avoid unnecessary operational and capital costs on overbuilt infrastructure. \nIn reality, this list could go on and on . . . a situation all too familiar to the security teams working tirelessly to defend. Consider the above key items for any team looking to factor some of the more virulent and trending threats into their protection strategy.\n\nFor more on threats targeting online business, and security architectures proving successful in defending transaction and service platforms, read the white paper “Solution Architectures for Online Business Protection from Advanced Cyber-Security Threats.”\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'risk management\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/05/your-risk-checklist-to-protect-against-online-business-cybersecurity-threats/');

The lines are blurred with most of these attacks as there are multiple motives behind them. However, one common theme to these attacks is the simplicity in which they are carried out. Hacktivists use an attack method known as an SQL injection to extract information from SQL databases that are vulnerable and exposed online.\n\nOWASP lists SQL injection as the number one web vulnerability. SQL is an attack targeting web applications taking advantage of poor application coding where the inputs are not sanitized, therefore exposing application vulnerabilities. SQL injection is the most famous type of injection attack, which can also include LDAP or XML injections. The idea behind an SQL injection is to modify an application SQL query in order to access or modify unauthorized data or run malicious programs. Most web applications rely on databases where the application data is stored and being accessed by SQL queries, and modification of these queries can result in taking control of the application. For example, an attacker would be able to access the application’s backend database with administrator access, run remote commands on the server, drop or create objects in the database, and more.\nFor instance, the sql query below, aiming at authenticating users, is common in web applications:\nmyQuery= ”SELECT * FROM userstable WHERE username = ‘userinput1′ and password =’userinput2’;”\nReplacing userinput1 by: ‘OR 1=1’); — would result in granting the attacker access to the database without knowing the real username and password as the assertion “1=1” is always true and the rest of the query is being ignored by the comment character.\nReplacing the userinput1 by ‘ OR 1=1″); drop table users;– would additionally drop the application users table.\n [You might also like: In the Crosshairs: Six Cyber Security Threats Gunning For Your Online Business]\nRecent Government hacks:\nCOMELEC – The database of the Philippine Commission on Election was breached via and SQL injection that resulted in exposing 55 million voters.\nCountry Liberal Party – An 18-year-old launched and SQL injection attack against the Country Liberal Party in Australia that resulted in 117 member’s personal information being exposed\nUN Climate Change Summit – Members of Anonymous allegedly used an SQL injection to target the UN Climate Change Summit website.

They can now take a stand on social and political issues on a global scale—without digital boundaries. Arguably, the most dangerous aspect of hacktivism is the intent. While many fight for political and social change, others will use these operations for personal and financial gain. Importantly, hacktivist groups are not as “leaderless” as they might have everyone believe. Motivation of a group’s leaders can be difficult to discern. Leaders could be propagandists, or foreign powers attempting to subvert a group into carrying out an attack for them. However, what all operations share is the exploitation of a “gang” mentality to build momentum and scale—tapping into the social fad and feeding some people’s desire to feel important. Given the amount of media attention data leaks attract, they serve as motivation for attackers to leak more data.

You’ve ensured your company is protected  against SQL injections and cross-site scripting, but then an employee clicks on  a pop-up to win a free iPad and your network has suddenly been infiltrated with  malicious code. What happened?\nIn analyzing  the 2015 cyber trends, we have found that cyber  attackers can effectively defeat IP-based defense systems by launching  application-level attacks that originate from real – but dynamic – IP  addresses.Â  One of the most common  variations of dynamic IP attacks is clickjacking. People may have come to believe  that clickjacking is an old-school tactic made up of spreading spam via social  networks, but it has evolved into sophisticated new forms, making traditional  defense paradigms insufficient.\nLet’s  understand how these new clickjacking forms work, discover the implications to  businesses, and explore challenges and best practices in defending against  them. \nWhat  is Clickjacking?\n Also known as UI  redressing, clickjacking is when a user thinks they are interacting safely with  a legitimate web page, but in fact, there is a malicious script running behind  the image or text the user interacts with, aiming to infiltrate their computer  and steal sensitive data.\n \n  Attackers use transparent iframes and malicious JavaScripts  to overlay the real website, so the user clicks the attack interface and  interacts with the attacker program. For example, the user thinks they are  entering to win a free iPad, when in fact they are transferring cash from their  bank to the attacker, as Troy  Hunt beautifully illustrates. \n Moreover, hackers can easily turn off CSRF token  protection, to influence browser behavior â like repositioning the cursor, placing  fragmented frames and more. It’s even easier when a site runs on an open source  application (PHP, Drupal, WordPress etc.)\nAnother form of clickjacking, which was very popular 3-4  years ago in social networks, is to embed traps in the news feed that look like  an exclusive piece of content, leading users to unwanted webpages where the  attacker code is running and sometimes even asks for personal details. This led  information security officers to underestimate the risks that clickjacking posesâas  though it wasn’t a security issue but rather a reputational issue. \n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\n Three  New Developments in Clickjacking\n Today clickjacking is  all over the place. Its purposes vary from spreading spam, installing bots,  injecting a virus or spyware to stealing data and more. While the click traps  method became less popular and less efficient as it became more common, the use  of transparent layers has evolved in sophistication and now resides in  attackers’ ammo boxes to be used in conjunction with other attack vectors simultaneously.\n Here are common cases: \n\n\n2nd  phase of social engineering\nIt is alreadyÂ  common knowledge that many attacks, campaigns  and APTs begin with profiling the target, carefully-selectedindividuals who are  the access point to the organization. After gathering all available personally  identifiable information comes the next stage of the malware injections. One of  the ways to do it is clickjacking.\n\n\nLeveraging  cloud services\nMany cloud providers offer a free tier  for developers and users who want to run small-sized servers and applications  on cloud infrastructures. This ease-of-use has a hefty price tag: insufficient  security validations that enable hackers to abuse the cloud services and  generate massive quantities of fraudulent accounts. It’s fertile ground for hackers  that continually seek access to more servers and services for the purpose of launching  malicious activities. The dynamic variety of IPs is exactly what a clickjacker  needs for an evasive campaign.\n\n\nAttacks  on mobile devices\nDuring the 2016 RSA conference, security  company Skycure revealed that 65%  of Android devices are clickjacking-vulnerable and that modern mobile malware can evade detection by using scanners  that rely on signatures and common analytics. In today’s BYOD  world, this is yet another access point to the corporate network.\n\n\n How Does  Using Dynamic IPs Perplex Security Teams? \n Dynamic  IP attacks target Layer 7, the application layer. Using real IP addresses, they  establish a three-way TCP handshake and successfully bypass cookie and  JavaScript challenges. These attacks are highly disruptive and difficult, if  not impossible, for IP-based defense systems to distinguish between legitimate  and malicious visitors. To overcome traditional defenses, attackers commonly  use headless browser software, such as PhantomJS or a Selenium WebDriver. They  also employ multiple evasion tactics. To avoid triggering size- or  rate-limiting thresholds, they split the load between dozens of IP addresses and  constantly add new ones. Human-like “behaviors” are incorporatedâstarting at different  landing pages and mimicking human-like timings and patterns of movement. They  can be especially difficult to detect when attacks are low rate and low volume  and are spread over time and across a large pool of changing IP addresses.\nClickjacking  logs are well assimilated among those of traffic generated by real users,  making it an extremely hard task to compare and make a distinction between the  two.\nWhy  are Businesses More Vulnerable?\n As mentioned, most security teams are concerned with XSS and SQLi and tune  controls against them. They often don’t prepare for clickjacking. The concern  is even larger as this type of malware â whatever it may be – can be later  spread across the company network, finally reaching its servers. It only takes  one employee login into your network to become susceptible to a clickjack â and  then they’re in. This way perpetrators can gain control of workstations by  installing bots, steal confidential data, spy on business conduct, ask for  ransom, and more.\n Since clickjacking is hard to track and considered low  risk, not all businesses have the know-how and the resources to prevent clickjacks,  so they remain vulnerable. Â They should  consider updating the policy of employees and users accessing corporate  devices, network or data, and patching when required.\n Thwarting  Clickjacking Attempts\nClickjacking protection would involve preventing other web pages from framing  your website. Countermeasures can be implemented either on the page code itself  or on the browser.\nThere are two main ways to prevent clickjacking (source: www.OWASP.org):\n\nSending the proper  X-Frame-Options HTTP response headers that instruct the browser to not allow  framing from other domains\nEmploying defensive  code in the UI to ensure that the current frame is the most top level window\n\n\n\nFor a technical drill down, please see refer to our Clickjacking Defense  Cheat Sheet.\nRead Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Clickjacking\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'security\', \'WAF Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/04/youve-been-clickjacked/');

It is often a place where they can securely and anonymously communicate with their contacts.\n\nBut first, what exactly is the Darknet?\n\nDarknet – A Darknet is an overlay network that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard communications protocols and ports.\nDark web – The Dark web is content that exists on Darknet, overlay networks which use the public Internet but which require specific software, configurations or authorization to access.\nDeep web – The Deep web is parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard search engines for any reason.\nClearnet – The Clearnet is a term typically referring to the unencrypted, or non-darknet. This traditional world wide web has relatively low-base anonymity, with most websites routinely identifying users by their IP address.\n\nTo be clear, the Darknet is a dangerous place where illicit or underground activities are conducted and can be found if you look for them. One of the most predominant features found on the Darknet are the digital marketplaces where different types of goods and digital items are bought and sold mainly for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Today we see a number of growing marketplaces found on both the Clearnet and the Darknet. These sites sell almost anything you can think of and are often a one stop shop for would be criminals.\nItems found in the marketplace include:\n\nSoftware/Malware\nSecurity/Hosting\nCounterfeit\nDrugs\nGuns\n\n\nFigure: 24 Hour DDoS service\n\nFigure: DoS 0-day exploit for Telegram\n [You might also like: Cyber Attack Market Place]\nHow do I get there from here?\nPeople often think that accessing the Darknet is a technical and complicated task. In reality accessing the Darknet has become very user friendly over the last several years. Both I2P and Tor offer great documentation for novice users and there are plenty on forums and tutorials out there to help educate those that want to learn more about the networks. The only part of the Darknet that actually requires a membership or invitation to join are certain marketplaces that want to control who can see and access the services that they are offering.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWhen accessing the Darknet you have many options to choose from. Two options include Tor, The Onion Router, and I2P, the Invisible Internet Project. Each has their own advantage and disadvantages and selection for use should be based on the user’s intentions.\nTor is an anonymous internet proxy that directs traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of thousands of relays. Tor wraps messages in encrypted layers and sends them through a bi-directional circuit of relays through the Tor network.  Tor also provides a central directory to manage the view of the network.\nThe Tor Project offers entry-level documentation for its new users and is easy to use. Tor over the years has become very popular with the common user. The Tor Browser Bundle made connecting to Tor very simple for the average user. Tor has received a large amount of academic review over the years and is a very well-funded project. One issue that still remains with Tor is the trust of exit nodes. Attackers can set up malicious exit nodes or spy on the traffic coming out of the network. The best use for Tor is for anonymous out proxing to the internet.\nI2p is an anonymous peer-to-peer network overlay that focuses on internal services. It allows users to send data between computers running I2P with end-to-end encryption. I2P uses unidirectional tunnels and layered encryption versus Tor bi-directional tunnels.\nI2P is not a very well-known service in comparison to Tor. It has received limited academic review but contains great documentation for all of its users. One issue regarding I2P is the limited number of out proxies to the internet. The best use for i2P is for peer-to-peer file sharing.\nAccessing some of these market places on the Darknet can be a challenge if you do not know what you are looking for. Many times you can find lists of hidden services or .onion links on Clearnet sites like Reddit and DeepDotWeb. TheHiddenWiki.org is also a great place to start looking for hidden services and marketplaces along with DNstats.net. DNstats provides updated information about the current status of certain marketplaces along with news about new sites as they become available.\nDarknet Marketplaces Include:\n\nAlphaBay\nValhalla\nDream\nHansa\nThe Real Deal\nDHL\nOutlaw\n\n\nFigure: DNstats, a Darknet status page\n [You might also like: 5 Ways Hackers Market Their Services]\nThere are also a few search engines to help you find what you are looking for on the Darknet. Two popular Darknet search engines are Grams, http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/, a Google looking knockoff and Torch, http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/. Both of these sites will allow you to search for content in the marketplaces and other hidden services found on the Darknet.\nExploring the Dark Markets:\nThese markets are not exactly special or unique but they have grown in popularity following the Silk Roads take down. Some markets can also be found on both the Darknet and the Clearnet. Sites like 0day today, hack forums, TorCrds, Hell and others sell similar items found on the Darknet and they almost always deal in bitcoin as well. You can also normally find some of the same services available on the Darknet on a number of hacker forums as well.\nHacker Forums\n\nV3rmillion\nRaid Forums\nGreySec\nRealForums\nEvilzone\n\n\nFigure: Torcrds.cc, a website selling stolen credit cards on the Clearnet\n\nFigure: HackForums users selling SSDP NTP and DNS list for amplified attacks\nMost vendors usually deal in Bitcoin or other types of cryptocurrencies. On many of the sites the vendors have to pay some form of a bond to be allowed to sell items or services on the site. These bonds can cost anywhere between .1 to 1 BTC. Some of these sites are also closed to the public and require a referral to join the marketplace.\nSome of the newest marketplaces this year include LEO Market, TheDetoxMarket and Apple Market. Last year there were around a dozen new sites that popped up. Some of these sites do not last long on the Darknet as they are often hacked or taken offline by their competition. The growth of the attack marketplace and the utilization of an anonymizing network like the Darknet will continue to grow over the next several years as the entry level for hackers keeps lowering.\nIn the next blog I will be talking about what an attacker can purchase on the underground marketplaces and what the going rate is for things like DDoS, Ransomware and more.

It is clear that airport infrastructure supports many  different operations that are critical for the efficiency and effectiveness of  the air transport system and availability of these systems is paramount.\n The following graphic from  helps illustrate the many risks to  the Air Transport Industry:\n\n  Cyber-security incidents are dramatically  increasing year-over-year across the full spectrum of international trade. Due  to their visibility, disruption of the essential operations of airlines and  airports could feasibly be the subject of a cyber-attack by cyber terrorists\n [You might also like: Aviation Accidents: Many Risks Move from Mechanical Failures to Terrorism. Are Cyber-Attacks Next?]\n For example, according to the Norwegian  publication Aldrimer.no, a cyberattack launched by a Russian APT group may have  jammed Sweden’s air traffic control capabilities in November 2015.\n Even as the aviation agency’s representatives were busy detailing to  media outlets the solar storm that they claimed “created disturbances in the  Earth’s magnetic field, which affected radar installations” (despite no nearby countries  experiencing a disruption), Swedish officials were alerting NATO that the  agency was being targeted in a serious cyberattack, according to the  publication.\n In June 2015, one of Poland’s airlines, LOT,  suggested that its operations at its Warsaw Chopin Airport hub were disrupted  by what the carrier said was a cyberattack on its flight planning computers.  Ten flights were canceled and other delayed.   The problem was widely reported to have been most likely caused by what  is known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack — when a hacker  deluges an organization’s system with so many communication requests that it  overloads the server, and it can no longer carry out its normal functions.\n \"This was a capacity attack, which  overloaded our network,\" said the LOT spokesman, Adrian Kubicki.  \nAnother such example would be the attack on  Istanbul Atatürk and Sabiha Gökçen airports a few years prior to the Polish  attack. In July 2013 the passport control systems at the departure terminals in  both of these airports were shutdown by a cyber-attack. Passengers were forced  to stand in line for hours, and the majority of flights were delayed. Even  though the systems were restored, the damage could be felt for many hours after.  Unfortunately, not all airports have  implemented cyber-security systems that would protect and control those  operations and all related features. It simply means that even though many may  have security measures in place, cyber criminals, ‘hacktivists’, or cyber  terrorists may consider this as a perfect opportunity to attack the airports in  many different ways.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\n This week I participated in a  fascinating discussion on threats to Aviation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical  University where we  discussed many aspects of this issue on camera.    In a previous blog articles, I’ve talked  specifically about whether or nota  Boeing 777 airliner can be brought down by a cyber attack. .  And my colleague recently talked about the  impact of last year’s Volkswagen  hack to IoT security.\nExample Four:  Cyberattacks  against Seaports and Maritime Operations\n  In 2013, the BBC reported that Police in  Belgium publicly disclosed an attack on the Antwerp Shipping port which had  been purported to have taken place over a two-year period from June 2011.\n\n Prosecutors say a Dutch-based trafficking group  hid cocaine and heroin among legitimate cargoes, including timber and bananas  shipped in containers from South America.   The organized crime group allegedly used hackers based in Belgium to  infiltrate computer networks in at least two companies operating in the port of  Antwerp. The breach allowed hackers to access secure data giving them the  location and security details of containers, meaning the traffickers could send  in lorry drivers to steal the cargo before the legitimate owner arrived.\n Workers were first alerted to the plot when entire  containers began to disappear from  the port without explanation.\nSix months ago in October, 2015, the potential  risk of cyberattacks on U.S. ports was raised by  the Rep. Candice Miller, R-Mich. Miller.   At that time she said, “As a result of asserted security gaps left  unfixed by the Department of Homeland Security, a cyberattack against an  American port could have dangerous consequences.”\n [You might also like: 4 Reasons Future Cyber-Attacks Could Be Terrorizing]\n The potential risk was also spotlighted by the  Government Accountability Office’s information security issues director,  Gregory C. Wilshusen, who stressed the importance of halting cyber-attacks and  security breaches at ports.\nMiller said: “The Coast Guard, and DHS as a whole, have been  slow to fully engage on cyber security efforts at the nation’s 360 seaports…The  Coast Guard has not yet conducted cyber risk assessments, though some  individual ports have taken the initiative themselves.”\n  The potential risk was also spotlighted by the Government  Accountability Office’s information security issues director, Gregory C.  Wilshusen, who stressed the importance of halting cyber attacks and security  breaches at ports\nConclusions: How to Solve the Problem?\n  In the end the threats to public  transport are serious, real and numerous.    Although I chose to leverage some boutique attack examples which were  widely publicized, there are scores of harder hitting examples from traffic  lights, to trains, to automobiles.\nThe key to understanding the  solution is to understand that the threat is immeasurably more serious to this  industry then many others which are only really concerned with business  continuity and financial losses.  In this  industry we must concern ourselves with the great possibility of loss of life  scenarios.\n In general, information security  people have long understood these risks, but the transportation and  manufacturing industries are just now waking from their mental slumber.   The key to solving these problems is first  to accelerate the awareness of the real possibilities of these dangers, then to  assemble a well-orchestrate cybersecurity risk and mitigation strategy for each  attribute of public transportation whereby we rely on automation where human  life can be placed in harms way. \n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'airlines\', \'automobiles\', \'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'ddos\', \'Hacking\', \'maritime shipping\',', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/04/cybersecurity-4-public-transportation-threats/');

Any number of people in business or government could have made a similar statement–it represents the thinking of government, business and individuals all across the world.

It is truly a societal question of: is the government’s drive to protect its citizens from threat greater than every individual’s right to privacy?  My colleague Carl Herberber expounds on the need for national privacy laws in a recent TechCrunch article.

We are seeing  new ransom tactics used daily to target companies from various industries and  individuals worldwide. The potential harm is devastating. We saw recent attacks  in Switzerland, Germany, Lithuania and Israel, as well as several attacks against  hospitals across the US and Canada.\n Unlike other  types of attacks—like Advanced Persistent Threats, or Multi-Layer Attacks— that  take a long time to defend against, or even detect.  Ransomware immediately shouts “I’m an attack  and I’m right here!” And then gives you 24-48 hours to either pay the ransom or  suffer the loss.\nSophisticated  New Attack Tools\n  While some of  the early ransomware tools extorted individuals, these new tools are targeting  businesses, hoping for a greater financial gain. New variants such as Locky,  Petya, Cerber and Samas have posed operational and financial challenges to  numerous businesses already. They encrypt all files on a certain server /  workstation and can be decrypted and restored only if the ransom is paid to the  attacker.\n\nLocky propagates through spam emails with  infected files, and changes all file extensions to .locky. \nSamas exploits webserver’s vulnerabilities to then spread inside the network \nPetya propagates via phishing and  introduces a new method of overriding  hard drive MBR. \nCerber masquerades itself as an Adobe Flash player update, impersonating to a Windows  executable to pop up in the next reboot. \n\nRansomware  attacks now join the ranks of corporate cyber ransom with other techniques like  Ransom-DoS, which began in 2015. Companies are threatened with  Denial-of-Service attack unless paying the ransom (read  how Swiss email provider Protonmail overcame a sophisticated DDoS ransom attack). These  multi-vector attacks involved over 100 Gbps volume of traffic combined with application  layer attacks. The attacks also included multiple encrypted attack vectors  including SSL SYN flood attacks that required advanced behavioral analysis to  identify malicious traffic and maintain legitimate encrypted traffic flows. \nThe Armada modus operandi was quickly replicated by a couple  of other groups, such as RedDoor in Germany and EzBTC_Squad. As the name  of the latter suggest – they realized that Ransom attacks are profitable.\n [You might also like: Ransom, Ransom Everywhere]\nHere is an email sent by Reddoor to their victims:\n \nAll types are  run in a semi manual way – meaning the hackers have to be actively engaged  throughout the operation – beginning with social engineering (in Germany they  targeted HR departments with infected CV’s and links. In other cases they  specifically targeted corporate executives), and later once penetrated they use  domain credentials, scan results and psexec. \n This indicates  a shift in skillset and a shift in ransomware, and provokes a real concern around  the future of ransomware as it grows in sophistication, automation, and moves  on to take on mobile devices too. What’s more, now just like there are DDoS  for hire programs, there are also Ransom-for-hire services available in the  darkweb.\n \n  Ransomware is  an easy way to make quick money. It can simply shutdown a business – it  threatens network availability, corporate reputation, company operations and it  is very costly to fight and to remediate. Once it has penetrated the company’s  network, it can easily spread among multiple servers and workstations, and  company productivity will crawl. Moreover – think of the US hospitals for  example – what happens if they lose crucial private patient information? That  raises the question of whether HIPAA addresses recent ransomware breaches.\n Ransomeware forces companies to pay a lot of money (or Bitcoins) to return operations  to normal.

In the case of the 2015 Ring of Fire, we have plotted this industry in the same ‘ring’ as last year, specifically in the “medium likelihood” ring. In our 2014 report, the Financial Services industry was an outlier in that it moved outward, from the “high likelihood” center out to the medium ring.\n\nIt’s important not to misinterpret what this means… in 2012-2013, Operation Ababil created a new and extremely high ‘watermark’ for the industry in terms of frequency and intensity of cyber-security attacks. In response to these attacks, most tier 1/2 financial service providers implemented a number of new or updated security capabilities. The movement out from the center ring in last year’s report was primarily a reflection of the attack volume coming down off of Ababil and the improved security posture resulting from new security investments.\nThis year’s report suggests that the Financial Services space has been stabilized to some degree, though vigilance in maintaining strong security posture against an ever-evolving threat landscape remains paramount. All over the world, attacks on these institutions continue. Typically, these groups demand Bitcoin or another form of crypto-currency to stop the attack, as in the recent ransom-based DDoS attacks on Greek banks. 2015 brought an increase in both the average ransom amount and the number of groups attacking financial targets.\nFinancial services are also targeted to gain access to information they hold. Information gained through data breaches in banks and corporations can be used through extortion for financial gain. In December 2015, hackers leaked customer data after a United Arab Emirates Bank failed to pay the $3 million ransom the hackers demanded. In addition, the stolen information is often sold in black markets, leaving the banks with the task of managing the crisis of customer data retrieval and fraudulent transactions.\n [You might also like: Early Attack Activity Forcing New Thinking in Healthcare IT/Security]\nListening to what the industry is telling us\nInformation security professionals from the Financial Services space are always among the most active participants in our quantitative study on cyber-security threats, and this trend continued with this year’s report. About 15% of total responses came from Financial Services organizations, representing the second largest single industry in response (trailing only telecommunications providers).\nIn conducting a review of responses specifically from this industry, a few interesting and notable trends emerge related to what kinds of threats they are facing today, how they are responding to threats, how they regard impacts from those threats, and also where they see the threat landscape going.\nIn many areas, Financial Services organizations mirror their counterparts in other industries on common and ongoing threats. There are modest increases with regard to the frequency of the top 3 threats (DDoS attack, Phishing, online fraud), with each representing about a 20-30% lift over others, but the stack ranking of threats is pretty consistent across all industries.\nOne area the financial services area stood out significantly from others is with regard to the frequency of advanced application threats, for instance the threats that make up the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10. These include attacks such as SQL injection, cross site scripting, and cross site request forgery. 98% of respondents in the Financial Services space reported incidence of these attacks versus 90% for other industries. What’s most notable about this is it is an indication that attackers are looking to exploit the trend within the commercial banking space to increase online engagement levels with customers, exposing new points of vulnerability and expanding their attack surface.\nNot surprisingly, Financial Services organizations also report a higher rate of SSL or encrypted attacks than others. 44% of respondents from Financial Services say they have been hit with an attack seeking to evade detection by sending through encrypted malicious traffic. We fully anticipate that this trend will continue. Financial Services providers naturally are expected to support encryption around sensitive financial transactions, and adversaries know this. They also know that relatively few security solutions do a good job of inspecting encrypted traffic to be potentially unwanted, malicious traffic.\nSpeaking of the shortcomings of certain security products, another area where Financial Services organizations differ from other industries is the frequency with which they see firewalls becoming the failure point during attack. Specifically, 39% of respondents from finance (versus 23% on average) claim that firewalls have gotten knocked offline, often the result of a DDoS attack that fills the session tables. For the financial services space, this represents the number one failure point whereas for others, Internet pipe saturation was the top failure point during attack.  This also speaks to sophistication of the attacks often targeting financial service providers.\nSome Variance in Security Tools\nBy in large, the Financial Services industry is using a lot of the same security products and services as other industries. There are a few exceptions or areas where their use differs, however.\nFinancial services organizations are about 40% more likely to be currently using some form of on-premises equipment (70% versus 50%). This is a reflection of the importance the industry puts on managing certain assets within their own data centers whereas other industries may be more aggressively moving assets into cloud hosting environments.\nThe industry is also more likely to be active users of dedicated DDoS attack protection. Fully, 87% of respondents from the Financial Services space indicated that they already are using or plan to implement DDoS protection, versus 67% of the total respondent pool.\nLikely as a result of the aforementioned frequency of OWASP Top 10 style application attacks, Financial Services organizations are also consuming application security components at a higher rate than others, with the most commonly used tools or services including penetration testing, on-premises Web Application Firewalls, and Static Application Security Testing (SAST).\n [You might also like: Securing Online Assets: Four Steps to Protect Your Online Business]\nWhat’s Keeping Financial Services Up at Night?\nWhen we explore the general impressions of where attacks come from, where the trends are leading, the Financial Services industry has some inputs that vary from others.\nIn general, the industry is anticipating attack frequency to maintain a steady state. Respondents from other industries were twice as likely to say they anticipate a 50% increase in attacks (8% versus 4%). However, that steady state already represents a greater frequency than others, as 37% of respondents from Financial Services organizations anticipate daily or weekly attacks versus 27% of the total respondent pool.\nFor me, one of the most interesting aspects of looking at the inputs from Financial Services organizations relative to others is around their perceptions around motive of attackers. More so than any other industry, the Financial Services industry believes the source of attacks comes from professional hacking (or attacking) organizations primarily motivated by financial gain. Makes sense, right? Attackers are after the very financial assets they hold and protect. However, Financial Services professionals feel somewhat less at risk of attack from hactivist groups than others (13% feel at risk). Yet, we know hactivism has been a key motive behind many attacks on banks. As symbols of wealth and sometimes capitalism, financial institutions are frequently the target of hacktivist campaigns. In fact, there is a very recent example through Operation Icarus, which was a series of offline and online actions coordinated by Anonymous intended to bring to public attention what they see as widespread corruption within the industry and situations of supporting or even funding “global terrorism.” Just goes to show that in all likelihood, someone somewhere has an issue with what your organization is doing, and hactivism can never be ruled out as a motive behind attack. You can read more about OpIcarus here.\nOverall, the inputs from the Financial Services space reflect a great deal of common thinking and observations about the threat landscape across industry. We can see business-driven trends around increased consumer engagement creating new points of vulnerability that are forcing new security focus. As we progress through 2016, it will be interesting to see if broader IT trends such as cloud migration and DevOps start to creep more deeply into Financial Services environments and affect results as we work towards next year’s report.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Finance\', \'Financial Security\', \'Threat Landscape\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/04/financial-organizations-threat-landscape/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (261, 'Why WAF & DDoS â A Perfect Prearranged Marriage – #2', 'David Monahan', '2016-4-6', 'David Monahan is Research Director for Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) and is a featured guest blogger.\nIn previous blogs I have written about DDoS attacks and the inadequacies of using ISP and cloud-based DDoS attack scrubbing by themselves. However, in this blog I am going to speak to why WAF and DDoS filtering make a great pair, focusing on the difference between and the benefits of combining the web application firewall (WAF) and DDoS filtering.\n\nWhen discussing DDoS defenses, we must note that there are both on and off-premises filtering solutions. Off-premises approaches are either ISP or cloud-based where the majority of the filtering takes place away from the targetâs network and are generally better at bulk filtering associated with volumetric attacks. On-premises solutions have an appliance that sits near the targets networkâs edge, filtering DDoS traffic. These solutions are generally better at filtering encryption, protocol, and web application-based attacks.\nOn-premises DDoS protection solutions have come a long way in the past few years. Huge breakthroughs have been made in their ability to support identification and filtering of web application DDoS attacks which attempt to either exploit specific functions/features within a web-facing web application in order to render those functions/features inoperable or to research, identify, and exploit a broader set of vulnerabilities with an organizationâs network architecture. The former can manifest itself as anything from disrupting transactions and/or stopping access to the backend databases to stopping search functionality, disrupting browser access or stopping other services within a web application, such as email notifications. The latter can manifest itself in multiple ways, but is often a two phased attack where the first phase renders an web application dysfunctional and the second phase then exploits another web application and exfiltrates its data. Ultimately, success in mitigating web application DDoS attacks requires correctly segregating and filtering incoming human traffic (real) from simulated traffic generated by bots and hijacked browsers.\n [You might also like: The Not-So-Odd Couple of DDoS and WAF]\n\nWAF technology works a little differently. While WAFs can analyze HTTP requests, they also protect more of the application stack. WAFs seek to identify how an application works beyond the communications layer. They analyze the types of requests and inputs for those request presented to the underlying application to discern how ânormalâ requests and inputs should be constructed and delivered to the application. The underlying technology can be used for any commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) or custom applications, but must either learn about or be tuned for the function of each specific application in the environment it protects. Since the WAF looks for attacks leveraged against the underlying application functionality, it can detect not only common attacks such as SQL injection (SQLi) and cross-site scripting (XSS or CSS), but can also detect other modified or custom constructed queries and inputs targeted at an application attempting to trick, defraud, or compromise an application in some way–each of which are outside the purview of a DDoS attack mitigation solution. In addition to identifying untrustworthy application interactions, newer WAF technologies can also create user fingerprints by the way users behave in the interactions with the application. Both malicious and nonmalicious application users tend to behave in a consistent manner when using an application so users can be identified by the way they move through the application and what parts they interact with. The way the user interacts with the application is not affected by changing the usersâ domain affiliation and/or IP address and thus does not affect the fingerprint, so the WAF solution can still detect that user as previously being a good or bad client.\nBoth WAF and on-premises DDoS mitigation solutions may use device fingerprinting to identify both âgoodâ and âbadâ users.Â  Good users are identified by consistent behaviors that are interacting with the application within normal parameters while bad users would be the opposite. To create the device fingerprint, the WAF or DDoS solution interrogates the client gathering many different information points about the device in order to uniquely identify that device. New devices are monitored while interacting with the application, then classified as good or bad and added to a database for future reference should they attempt to communicate again in the future. Device fingerprinting is also domain and IP independent so users can be identified no matter where they come from.\nWhile both technologies work using variations of pattern matching (signatures) to capture simple attacks, the solutions that apply behavioral analysis to filter out the more sophisticated attacks are able to capture more advanced client and application interactions and thus provide a highly complementary and more effective solution set. Each can operate within its own domain without the other, but companies using either solution alone are more likely to experience successful attacks leading to service degradation and outages.Â  Combining the two technologies creates a situation where the sum of the parts is greater than each individually thus making the investment in both technologies.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Why WAF & DDoS â A Perfect Prearranged Marriage â #2\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/04/waf-ddos-perfect-marriage/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"David Monahan\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/stresser-services.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 529,\n        \"width\": 379\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2016-04-06\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2016-04-06\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud WAF\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'ISP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/04/waf-ddos-perfect-marriage/');

It is fair to say  that for these and future generations, it will be next-to-impossible to be a  productive member of society without surrendering to the myriad social media  applications and other online platforms.\n Our transformation to a  fully-connected society is similar in many ways to the transformation business  has gone through over the past 15-20 years, ultimately leading to a state where  no business can exist today without having at least started down the path of  becoming an online business.\n\n\nThe notion of the ‘online business’ was born in the  mid-to-late 1990’s largely as brick-and-mortar stores took to the new platform  of the World Wide Web. In 1999, the online sales of products sold through  physical stores totaled approximately $20 billion, or nearly two-thirds of all  sales on the Web. Today, ecommerce sales in the U.S. alone are over $335  billion, and are projected to increase to $523 billion by 2020.\n But the idea of the online business is by no means limited  to ecommerce today. The emergence of Software-as-a-Service, online  transactional platforms and social media have extended the idea of a business  run, or services delivered, largely online to a wider array of industries.\n [You might also like: Securing Online Assets: Four Steps to Protect Your Online Business]\nStages of  Connectedness \n  Businesses can be loosely categorized into different stages  or phases of online transformation. The earliest stages would include adoption  of online tools and resources to increase employee productivity and mobility.  Few if any businesses haven’t made this leap. \n Second phases of the transformation into an online business  would be characterized by the use of online services or platforms to support  partner or customer engagement or interaction. The extension of internal  business processes to the outside world via the Internet in many ways  represents the tipping point for broader exposure and risk. \n Third phase would include deployment and management of  online transactional platforms that become critical for revenue generation.  Clearly any business engaged in ecommerce would fall into this category, as  would financial services organizations conducting online transactions. \n The final phase would be organizations needing to support  globally deployed websites or applications reliably and securely to deliver  services. This is a particularly important step as it comes with the need to  make IT assets broadly available to the public, yet maintain security and  protection of sensitive data.\n Each of these phases comes with increased benefits but also  increased threats from cyber-security. Organizations from online retailers  (ecommerce), financial services, online gaming, social media or entertainment,  and even the travel industry have transformed the way they do business and in  so doing have become increasingly network-dependent. We look at protecting  online businesses differently from others due to the unique nature and the  heightened level of impact felt from cyber-security threats.\nTargeted threats  against online business\n\nFor online businesses, cyber-security threats pose  particular risk as attackers seeking to take advantage of the knowledge that  these businesses cannot afford downtime or loss of customer trust. In providing  protection for a wide array of online businesses, Radware has a broad  perspective on these threats. There are some common characteristics of the  threats and the way online businesses respond to the risk they pose:\n\nSensitivity to website/service availability: for  any business, downtime of websites or online services is bad. But for online  businesses, the translation into revenue loss is direct and immediate. As a  result, online businesses need to stay vigilant against the category of attacks  that threaten service/site availability, such as DDoS attacks.\nRisk posed by customer data loss: Online  transaction fraud costs industry an estimated $3.5 billion annually. Much of  this activity is attributed to the theft of consumer credit card information  breached by application attacks that exploit online business applications.  The impacts of transaction fraud also extend  beyond the immediate transactions. Consumers consistently say that if their  sensitive data is breached, they will likely no longer conduct business with  that merchant.\nSensitivity to latency: while downtime costs are  obvious, it can be easy to overlook the impact on performance degradation. Any  sources of latency, whether you’re talking about attacks or implementation of  security controls, can have a significant impact. According to recent studies,  40% of customers now will wait 3 seconds or less before moving on to a  competitor site, meaning the impact of performance loss is extremely tangible  for online businesses. \nThreat of encrypted attacks: Attacks leveraging  encrypted traffic as an attack vector are on the rise, further challenging many  of the cyber threat solutions currently in place. Most cyber-attack mitigation  technologies do not actually inspect SSL traffic, as it requires decrypting the  encrypted traffic. Online businesses need to ensure solutions can address the  needs of high capacity mitigation, support all common versions of SSL and TLS,  and can isolate suspicious encrypted traffic using behavioral analysis to limit  legitimate user impact.\n\n [You might also like: Your Risk Checklist to Protect Against Online Business Cyber Security Threats]\nThere are many ways organizations  can look to protect themselves.  Large  companies may have extensive security teams dedicated to implementing and  managing the optimal security controls for their network.  In this type of environment, you are likely  looking for the most comprehensive security technologies to support you.\nHowever, not all organizations can  afford to hire large security teams, but their need for cyber security  protection is still as real and relevant.   For this kind of environment, you should seek out a security vendor that  has extensive experience providing Online Business Protection to a wide array  of customers in the core industries that make up the loosely defined segment.  You want this partner to be able to handle all  kinds of attacks, from application DDoS, to volumetric floods, to SSL-based and  other encrypted attacks, and more. You may also want a partner with the  expertise to provide security as a managed service, minimizing impact on  existing security resources.\nLook for a solution provider that  can build tailored architectures that map to the growing and evolving needs for  protection. Three common architectures are defined in our new ebook, Opportunities, Threats and  Security Strategies for Online Business. While ultimately the  solutions architectures can be customized based on needs, these architectures  have served a mix of customers well over the year.

Each year, more and more businesses  adopt webscraping tools as part of their business intelligence and advertising  initiatives.  In fact, webscrapers are actually  accountable for 22% of the world’s internet traffic.\n Webscraping allows indexing and  structuring of extensive data amounts, leading to a possibility to run various  statistical, behavioral and qualitative analyses. This is exactly where it  becomes ambiguous. Such large data assets can become a vehicle for either good  or malicious purposes. On one hand, webscraping facilitates information  transparency and availability. On the other, it poses risks of information  abuse. There have been many legal battles to define the line between legitimate  and nefarious use of this technology. Today, there is still a gap in  enforcement.\n\nWebscraping abuse and cyber-attacks:\n  One of the common uses for webscraping is to  hunt for online bargains. Webscraping tools allow an individual to keep  following any online shop price and produce numerous requests once a  price drop is identified.  These requests  can be carried out by either a human being or a bot. A bot is far more  efficient as it can generate multiple requests per minute (real or fake). The  result may be emptying the online store inventory or simply a significant  reduction in its margin. Grey marketers can  later sell these goods at a higher price.   \n Think about it… Have you ever tried to purchase  concert tickets the second they went onsale online, but all the good seats were  gone already?  Later you can find all  those good seats available on ticket broker websites for 5 -8 times the  cost?  That is a result of webscraping.\n Alternatively – a business’ competitor can  harvest your company data using such software programs. They can gain access  not only to public knowledge but can even consume gated content from your  website. Webscraping allows the competition to receive real time updates on  pricing and promotions, product information and other plans. Such software,  with Dynamic IP service, is available on the dark market place for dimes.\n Business risks may include:\n\nRevenue loss\nTemporary or permanent suspension of  visitors and customers\nReputation loss\nPoor SLA and user experience\nIncrease in web infrastructure cost\n\n [You might also like: Why Online Retailers Should Be on High Alert for Cyber Attacks]\nProtecting my organization:\n  Publish a clear Terms & Conditions  (T&C). Decide if you allow scrapers to run on your site or not. Remember  that any visible content can be scraped. Identify the sensitive data on your  site to block any attempt of abuse. Webscraping has some unique  characteristics, though it constantly improves in simulating human behavior.  For example, a data-focused scraping attack will normally target specific web  pages where information can be extracted. Since in  most cases perpetrators will use spoofed or dynamic IP, the challenge will be  to recognize the footprint of the device launching the attacks.\n Here are few recommended steps to make a  scraper sweat:\n\nIdentify repetitive interest in specific  web pages – limit requests and downloads\nBan IP addresses or devices\nReturn fake data\nSensitive information should be gated and  accessed only with authorization\nConsider converting data to images or  flash\n\nWebscraping and Airline Tickets\n  For a major US-based airline, this type of  cyber-attack occurred with alarming frequency. Bots were programmed to “scrape”  certain flights, routes and classes of tickets. With the bots acting as faux  buyers—continuously creating but never completing reservations on those  tickets—the airline was unable to sell the seats to real customers. In essence,  the airline’s inventory was held hostage, and a growing number of flights were  taking off with empty seats that could have been sold.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (265, 'How to Prepare for a DDoS Attack', 'Ron Winward', '2016-3-29', 'Our 2015-2016 Global Network & Application Security Report documented that 51% of businesses suffered a DDoS attack in 2015.  Further, 90% of businesses suffered some sort of cyber attack during that same period.  This is an astonishing number and as network operators, we need to be prepared.  DDoS attacks can be a debilitating event to your business, but they don’t have to be.  If you’re prepared, you can help control the outcome.\n\nWhile Radware does offer an industry leading solution for DDoS mitigation, there are plenty of other things you can be doing to be prepared.  With some planning and practice, you can be ready.  Let’s go through some ideas.\nVisibility\n\nVisibility is critical when preparing for issues in your network.  SNMP graphing platforms will tell you an extraordinary amount of information on volumetric attacks.  You’ll be able to see and (depending on the platform) sometimes even alert on anomalous bandwidth events.  You’ll be able to track at which port it entered your network, if it’s saturating any links, and even where the attack is headed.  It’s surprising how many companies I’ve worked with over the years that  do not deploy this because it’s such an easy and basic thing to implement.  Primarily, you need devices that can speak SNMP, such as managed switches, routers, etc., and then you need a platform to query them.\nFor querying/graphing, there are plenty of good platforms out there, including free, SaaS, and traditional licensed software.  I personally like Observium, which is free and does a great job.  The good folks at Turnkey Linux have developed a self-contained distribution of it (among plenty of other cool things!).  Other tools include LibreNMS, Cacti, MRTG, and the like.  I’ve also used a SaaS platform called LogicMonitor, which is feature rich and includes anomaly alerting, but is not free.\n [You might also like: At Risk for DDoS Outages? If You Answer Yes to the First Five Questions…WATCH OUT!]\nDetails\nSNMP certainly won’t catch everything, even when the attack is volumetric.  Wait, what?  Yes, it’s true, they’re good at monitoring traffic levels, but the downside is that they only poll devices on preconfigured intervals.  The most recent Global Network & Application Security Report found that 57% of cyber attacks lasted less than one hour.  Some of that is attributed to burst attacks, which are very short but devastating bursts of traffic designed to disrupt traffic but not be detected.  When your SNMP platform polls at 5-minute intervals and you receive a 1-minute volumetric burst attack, you have a low probability of actually catching that attack with SNMP during your polling cycle.  More likely, you’ll experience a disruption and not know what the problem is because everything looks normal.  You can shorten the polling interval, but that increases load on the device you’re polling and overly aggressive polling can be problematic.  Another issue with SNMP is that you have to have to be able to poll and respond.  If you’re under attack and the monitoring happens somewhere in that forwarding path of a volumetric attack, you might see blank spots/dropouts in your graphs.\nHowever, if your network supports flow (netflow, ipfix, sflow, etc) you can ship this data to a flow collector and start to gain even more insight to traffic in your network.  Flow data is different from SNMP reporting in that the router or switch will send UDP traffic out to a flow collector at preconfigured sample rates.  If you’re sampling at 1 in 8192 packets, you’re going to catch those pesky burst attacks that evaded your SNMP polling interval.  Flow data also shows you terrific details like source IP, destination IP, source/dest ports, etc.  Here’s an example:\n\nAs you can see, this information can be very helpful when identifying and blocking an attack.  There are several good tools out there for flow data. Our friends at Kentik have a great SaaS option that I have always liked, and NFDump/NFSen is a popular open source option that I’ve also used extensively. One tip here is that many devices can only send flow to a few limited targets, so to overcome this in the past, I have used tools like Samplicator to fork the flows to different targets and to manipulate them as needed.\nCapacity\nNetwork capacity is another thing that you often have in your control.  The obvious first thing that comes to mind is having enough capacity to absorb a volumetric attack.  Our 2015-2016-Global Network & Application Security Report showed that 36% of attacks that we observed had saturated the internet link of that network.  In other words, even if those networks had the absolute best equipment that money could buy, 36% of the time, the attack filled their internet link before they could even help!\nCapacity is a tricky one, though, because how do you plan for enough capacity for a volumetric attack?  Do you buy another 1G link?  More 10G links?  There’s a point where that doesn’t become cost effective, and I’ll discuss Radware’s solutions for that at the end, but capacity is a tool that you can use to help alleviate bottlenecks.\n [You might also like: Network as a Sensor: A New Approach to the DDoS Problem]\nIf you have diverse capacity from diverse providers and can run BGP with them, you can influence what comes into your network where.  You might only announce the prefix that is being attacked out of one provider and the rest of your traffic out the other.  You can even do a similar technique with two links from the same provider.  In fact, check with your providers because many will allow you to announce smaller than a /24 for this specific reason – traffic engineering over separate links in their network.  In this example, you could announce all prefixes out one link and just the /32 being attacked out the second link.  When you do this, the more specific route in BGP will be preferred and you can take the attack traffic on separate capacity to ensure that it doesn’t harm your remaining traffic.\nCapacity is not limited to internet pipe size.  Another technique you can use is to add compute capacity and spread the traffic load with an ADC/load balancer.  By distributing the load of an attack, you’re lessening the load on any given server.\nMitigation Tools\nArguably the most important aspect of an attack is how you will handle and mitigate it.  If you’ve done the prep work, you have a plan on how to handle an event.  Using the methods above, fingerprinting an attack and then attempting to block it with policy somewhere in the network is an option, albeit a reactive measure.  It requires a human to make an accurate assessment of the situation and then formulate the correct policy to implement somewhere in the network.  What if it’s a multi-vector attack?  What if the attack changes after you implement a particular measure?  This absolutely happens and without the proper tools, you’re entering a cat-and-mouse game with your attacker.  How long can one person or even an entire team keep this up?  Can you block an application-layer attack the same way that you can a network-based flood?\nYou need a tool that can detect and mitigate instantly.  Traditional firewalls can’t do this and they can even cause an outage, as I’ve shown in a previous post.  To truly have complete coverage, you need a purpose-built DDoS mitigation appliance that can handle these complex attacks and can begin mitigating instantly.  Our award-winning DefensePro  product can help you do just that.\nPlan Your Event\nWhat is important to you if you receive an attack?  When I was a network operator, my goals were to:\n\nHave enough capacity to absorb an attack\nHave the tools to find and fingerprint an attack\nHave the tools to contain and mitigate an attack\nHave the tools to monitor my application and network performance, and alert on anomalies such as high latency or availability issues\nHave a method of notifying the internal stakeholders at my organization if something happened\nHave a method of notifying my customers if there was impact to them\nHave the tools available for forensic reporting and post attack analysis\n\nDocument what is important to you and how you will handle an event.  Who needs to know?  Who will help?  Will social media need to be involved?  If you plan this ahead of time, things will be less chaotic when an attack comes.\n [You might also like: The Top 5 DDoS Attack Types We Saw in 2015]\nTesting and Dry Run\nThere are several ways to test your network and the attack vector doesn’t necessarily matter for this.  Essentially, you want to go through the steps of a mock attack to see how your plan works.  For testing tools, the common ones are widely available on the internet and there are companies who can do this kind of testing for you.  Our 2015-2016-Global Network & Application Security Report even has a chapter that explains how to simulate an attack on your network, and if you need more ideas, you can contact us to get in touch with me.  The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the steps you need to take during an attack.  Perhaps you even write a runbook.  If you test yourself and become familiar with what you need to do for your own organization’s goals, you’ll be ready if the time comes.\nBest Practices\nPersonally, I believe that the best approach is to begin with detection and mitigation at the perimeter of the network.  DDoS mitigation at the entire perimeter isn’t always practical, so sometimes people build scrubbing centers inside of the network to handle specific incidents, but still detect at the edge.  The mitigation appliance can be paired with a Web Application Firewall (WAF), where the WAF can detect and block application layer attacks and either block them locally or signal to the edge to block them there.  I’d also pair that with a central management and reporting platform that acts as a single pane of glass for configuration, maintenance and operation, as well deep forensics and reporting for incident reporting and postmortem analysis.  If volumetric attacks are a concern for your organization, you might consider adding a cloud-based scrubbing partner to divert your traffic to when under attack.  Radware has a complete DDoS protection solution for all of this.\nConclusion\nPreparing for DDoS attacks comes down to identifying the risks in your network, identifying the tools that you can use to defend your network, and having a plan for how you will engage when it happens.  This comes with planning and exploring options that work for your organization.  Radware’s strength in this area comes with a long standing history in defending networks against cyberattacks, combined with innovative ideas on how to protect a network.  I’d be happy to have an objective conversation about your plan if you’re interested.  Just contact us or your local account team to get started.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect

There is a critical need for “Always on” services especially for Telecom companies providing cloud based solutions for organizations and clients over the Internet.

My kids recently had an \"emergency study exercise\" in  grade-school where they needed to log in to the school system from home and  participate in an online classroom, listen to a session and answer some  questions.  The idea was to see if the  school was prepared for emergency situations, where the kids couldn’t attend  school for some reason, but they could continue studying remotely.  I thought that was pretty cool.  \nI also learned recently about a high school  in our area where all the classroom activity is conducted online.  The students have no books, no notebooks –  only their laptop.  Gone are the days  where you needed to carry a backpack full of books that almost broke your back.  Students definitely have it easier these days!\n But all these advancements come at a cost.  Educational Institutions now have to deal with  managing a complicated online network though a typically under-resourced IT  department.  They don’t always have the  experience and expertise to be able to fully protect their network from something  like a cyber-attack.  \n\n The complexity and sophistication of cyberattacks continue  to grow but  the ease of which one can  start a DDoS attack today is also growing.   With the variety of tools and services that exist today, attackers can  simply hire a service, at a very low cost, to \"help me DDoS my  school\".  Whether its students that  are unhappy with their grades, want to avoid upcoming exams or just take their  anger out on the education system, more and more schools and education  institutions are targeted with DDoS and other cyber-attacks. \n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\n That’s one of the main  trends Radware identified in its annual Ring of Fire analysis published in  Radware’s 2015-2016 Global Application & Network Security Report.  The Cyber-Attack Ring of Fire maps vertical  markets based on the likelihood that organizations in these sectors will  experience attacks. The Ring of Fire reflects five risk levels. As industries  move closer to the red center, such organizations are more likely to experience  DoS/DDoS and other cyber-attacks and experience such attacks at a higher  frequency.  We’ve been tracking  industries in this way for the past 5 years and have seen almost all, move  closer to the center of the ring over the years.  In this past year alone, we’ve seen several  verticals face consistent levels of threat, while both Education and Hosting  moved from “Medium” to “High” risk.\n In the previous year, we saw both Education and Health  industries make their first appearance in the Ring of Fire. That was somewhat  unexpected – who would think to attack a school or a hospital?  But that’s exactly what happened.  Starting with the publicized attack on the  Boston Children’s Hospital in 2014 following a dispute over a treatment of a  child, we’ve since seen a number of health institutions become a target of  cyber-attacks.  With Education, the story  is even more extreme – this past year we’ve seen a big increase in attacks on  this industry.  For the various reasons  mentioned above, cyber-attacks on school and other educational websites  increased this past year, most commonly hitting the mail server and targeting  sites and services for submitting work and managing the admission process.  All are “business” critical to any  school—with downtime leading to day-to-day chaos and potential damage to an  institution’s reputation.\n [You might also like: Is Your Organization Prepared? The 2015-2016 Global Application and Network Security Report]\n Government services and gaming companies are also at a high  risk and maybe more likely, almost \"expected” targets of cyber-attacks  these days.  The increase in hacktivism  and the adoption of cyber-attacks by terror organizations, have led to  continued attacks on governments around the world. In November 2015, several Thai  government websites were hit by DDoS attacks, making them inaccessible for  several hours. More recently, Turkish government sites were inaccessible in an  ongoing attack on DNS services. Anonymous claimed responsibility for this 40  Gbps DDoS attack.\n Hacktivist groups have also put a focus on gaming companies  with repeated attacks and very organized campaigns against leading, worldwide  companies.  Part of the appeal of  targeting gaming services is that mandatory constant connectivity and  availability of a centralized gaming platform creates a single point of  failure. That makes for “efficient” attacks— with attackers able to cause more  damage using fewer resources.\n And of course, Hosting companies – where even the large  hosting companies have experienced significant attacks this past year.  Here we see attacks that are targeting  website owners and through that, impacting the hosting company itself, as well  as attacks targeting the hosting company directly.  We’ve also seen the increase in ransom-based  attacks with this industry – where ISPs and their customers are threatened with  a DDoS attack unless a ransom is paid.   Such was the case with ProtonMail – a Swedish encrypted email service  provider – who was attacked with a ransom-based attack in November 2015.  That attack initially took down both ProtonMail’s  service as well as its ISP’s network.\n As we look back at this year’s Ring of Fire and think about  next year’s – the story really comes down to \"no one is immune\".  With the varied motivations of attackers, the  sophistication of attacks and the ease of which they can launch these  campaigns, no organization can safely say it won’t be attacked.  It’s no longer a question of if and when, but  really a question of how an organization will be attacked.  So you should ask yourself – are you  prepared?\n\n\nTo find out if your organization is within the Ring of Fire for cyber-attacks, please download our guide. \nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'Cyber Security\', \'Education\', \'Energy and Utility\', \'Financial\', \'Gaming\', \'governm', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/03/are-you-in-the-ring-of-fire/');

Part of this growth can be attributed to the growing number of markets and attack services available to the public.  \n\nToday, those who wish to carry out a digital attack do not need to learn about network security or progrmaming. If they are willing to pay they can skip the lines and jump right into the action of clicking buttons and using user friendly portals to carry out their attacks.  It’s no longer necessary for an attacker to build their own tools when vendors have made their tools cheap and easy to access.\n\nA main motivation behind the evolution of attack services in the market place is due to financial gains.  The profits behind selling tools to entry level attackers has led to the creation of highly popular and easily accessible marketplaces where potential attackers can purchase anything from undisclosed exploits and malware to botnets, bulletproof hosting and a number of other attack services.  Price is the only limiting factor of what one can accomplish with limited skills. The more money an attacker has to spend, the more damage he or she can create with little to no experience.\n [You might also like: Cyber Attack Marketplace]\nThose with access to limitless funds can buy all the gear, tools and exploits they need to attack even the largest networks. This can be an absolute benefit for an inexperienced attacker, yet in some ways it works against them since they do not know what they are truly doing. They have a better chance for success given what they can purchase, but at the same time they run a greater probability for failure due to their lack of knowledge.  An attacker with a limitless budget could not only go on a serious shopping spree but they could also buy some of the best hardware and network power to conduct their attacks.\nSo, why does this matter? This matters because the entry level for attackers has been lowered. No longer do you have to be a skilled or knowledgeable hacker to take down a network. The more money you have to spend on attack services, the more you can accomplish without prior experience.\nOver the next few months I will be writing about different attack services, tools and marketplaces found on the darknet.  I will also be writing about how the growth in general users and their demands for an easy to use and powerful tool has resulted in the monetization of the less experienced.  This monetization has led to a much lower buy in, allowing more users the ability to access the powerful tools required to knock out large scale networks with almost no experience required.  \n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'cybersecurity\', \'Darknet\', \'ddos\', \'Hacking\', \'malware\', \'Marketplace\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/03/cyber-attack-marketplace/');

No one actually came out and said it in those words, but there is  an undeniable degree of humility to many of the messages passing through the  halls of the Mascone Center this year. Oh sure, there was still plenty of  bravado about features and capabilities pouring off the lips of those working  the 1,700 vendor booths that made up two exhibit halls. And a high degree of  innovation was also on display, in particular in areas of analytics, deception  technologies and automated security controls. \nBut I couldn’t help notice that there were four or five  common tomes of the week that echoed this sense acknowledging a loss of control  and confidence of preventing exploit or exfiltration. Here are some of the  common themes coming from the many end users I spoke to at the show:\n1. “I can’t get control of my users”\nIf I had to nominate an Acronym  of the Year based on its prevalence at RSA, I would have to go with CASB,  short for Cloud Access Security Broker. There seems to be a growing hope that  this can be the silver bullet to protect organizations (and CIO’s) from  catastrophic loss caused by users putting data they shouldn’t into SaaS  environments. If you’re not familiar with the CASB space, the basic idea is  acting as a middle-man between employees and their use of any external SaaS  based applications.  \n [You might also like: Static Cloud Security is Obsolete: Long Live Continuously Adaptive Cloud Security!]\nThink security  controls on how employees access Saleforce.com even when they access via  credentials from their iPad off their home network. Now think of applying this  to the myriad SaaS solutions popping up that require little or no IT support to  stand up. The two CASB sessions I attended last week had a common message from  the end user (enterprise) community . . . there are hundreds if not thousands  of apps out there that your users are accessing and likely exposing to  sensitive data. The emphasis of value described by these end users tended to  lean heavily on the discovery aspects of the problem, likely an indication of  the early state of the market.\n\n2. “I don’t control the apps I’m asked to protect”\n The emergence of DevOps and ‘Shadow IT’ remained heavy  themes and ominous trends at this year’s event. Increasingly, IT and security  teams are feeling left out of the process as application developers working  within individual business units spawn unknown (and certainly un-scanned)  applications out into cloud hosting environments. This situation is creating  major challenges for both finding and keeping up with the changes to these apps  as they pop up. We’ve been in environments where some applications running on  DevOps cycles see as many as 100 changes on a daily basis. \n3. “I’m losing the security budget”\n  Perhaps a next step in this evolution of devaluing of the  security team is the actual loss of budget for securing apps popping up in  various public clouds. As budgets for optimizing cloud based applications move  into non-IT parts of the company (e.g., marketing or ecommerce teams). For  example, rolling security controls into a CDN. This is a particular troubling  and dangerous trend, and not only because it signals a broader threat to the  security team’s influence. This is mainly common in smaller organizations or  those that are purely focused on satisfying some basic compliance requirements  and are all-too-happy to believe the vendors in this space in terms of the  level of protection they provide. Our own experience with these solutions is  they severely lack in particular positive security models that ensure  protection beyond whatever limited database of known threats they maintain, or  what you can get from common open-source tools (e.g., ModSecurity). \n4. “I can’t keep up”\n Security professionals can be forgiven for having a growing  feeling of defeat when it comes to keeping pace with the evolution of the  threat landscape. The degree of automation driving fast-morphing tactics and  vectors combined with the ease of scaling attacks to new levels of volume are  an ominous challenge for even the best of security teams. We believe the  solution to the problem of automation is . . . automation, this time applied to  the protection side of the coin. In our recent 2016 Global Network  & Application Security Report, we highlighted not only the increase in  automated attacks, but also the reality that only 20% of respondents to our  survey indicate they are using the automation capabilities in their security  tools.\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation – Which One is Right For Your Organization?]\n5. Back to (the new) basics\n The fact is that all of the changes that networks and  application environments have undergone haven’t changed the basics of what’s  needed for security. They’ve only changed the way those security controls can  and should be applied. And it’s time for security professionals to take back  the reigns when it comes to assessing and minimizing risk.  Security professionals still sit in the ideal  seat to assess the likely of being targeted by certain threats, being exposed  by certain vulnerabilities, and assessing the they risk.\nBased on these conversational themes, here are are some  important principles that aren’t new, but might have greater urgency in today’s  threat landscape and complex computing environments.\n\n\nLeverage automation – will help you keep up with  the automation we see on the threat landscape side. The availability of  technologies like Real-Time Signature development and Automated Policy  Generation have matured considerably over the past few years, and it is time  for security professionals to put more trust in these tools.\n\n\nAdapt protections to keep pace with the rapid  changing application space – if you think your “application guy” can keep up with  all the new applications being born within your organization, much less all the  changes that create new potential vulnerabilities, you’re fooling yourself.  Investigate solutions like our WAF’s new  integration with HP WebInspect that can very granularly identify changes to  applications and trigger WebInpsect to scan the file or folder. Any holes can  automatically be addressed by a virtual patch implemented as a new policy on  the WAF.\n\n\nIncorporate cloud migration capabilities in  assessing points of security control – assume that half or more of the  applications in your datacenter today will be out in a cloud hosting  environment within 3 years. In conjunction with that, you need to look for  solutions that won’t require you to manage different policies through different  interfaces across the growing number of environments you’re protecting.  The coordinated policy orchestration within  our Cloud  WAF is a good example of this.\n\n\nEducate and collaborate with your less security  minded peers – regardless of shadow IT or other trends graying the line of  security, you’re still accountable for being the leading for security within  your team. As business units or ecommerce groups seek to roll IT requirements  (availability, security) into broader relationships, you need to be the voice  of reason for what those services can really do. That means not only speaking  up, but also doing a thorough assessment of security controls.\n\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'bot automation\', \'CASB\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Hackers\', \'Infosec\', \'RSA\', \'security\', \'Shadow IT\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/03/takeaways-2016-rsa/');

Each year, we work closely with a customer that has made the difficult, but admirable decision to shine a light on their experiences as a victim of a cyber-security attack.  By sharing, these customers can help others prepare for what now is sadly an inevitable experience for many companies.\n\nOf late, I’ve noticed an interesting intersection from the featured case studies of the past two years that on the surface seem to have very little in common.  In 2015, the report profiled an advanced attack against the Boston Children’s Hospital and this year the case study chronicled a ransomware attack against the encrypted email provider ProtonMail. The Presbyterian Medical Center attack sought to leverage the same fears (interruption of medical care) as the Boston Children’s attack, but with a motive that mirrors ProtonMail’s ransom attack (financial gain).\nTherein lies the connection – the malicious targeting of an provider of medical services (including emergency medical services) acts as the anchor point for an argument that ties the Protonmail and Boston Children’s Hospital attacks together.\n [You might also like: Ransomware Takes the Stage as a Major Corporate Security Risk]\nRansom Attack Profiles\nThe ProtonMail case study reinforces a key piece of data from the survey results, that specifically there has been a 50% increase in ransom as a motivation for attackers. This increase grew from 16% in 2014 to 25% in 2015.  These ransom attacks are on the rise for a number of reasons.  First, the ease of access and relative low cost of launching disruptive attacks makes the motive of immediate financial gain attractive. So too does the increased ease of masking the source of attacks through spoofing IPs or accessing targets via a CDN or global NAT that will obfuscate the exact attacking resources as part of a broader network.\n\nIn November 2015, ProtonMail experienced consecutive attacks initiated with a ransom request by a new hacker group, The Armada Collective. Hoping to stop the attacks, ProtonMail paid a ransom, only to see the attacks continue with volumetric and burst attacks combining application and network vectors. These advanced DDoS attacks included volumetric attacks over 100 Gbps as well as application layer attacks. The attacks also included multiple encrypted attack vectors including SSL SYN flood attacks that required advanced behavioral analysis to identify malicious traffic and maintain legitimate encrypted traffic flows. In the end, ProtonMail found the only real solution was the use of advanced DDoS mitigation technology to provide sustained protection.\nIn the previous year’s report, we told the story of Boston Children’s Hospital, which became the target of intense attacks in April 2014. The motive here, however, was different. The attacks stemmed from publicity around a high-profile child-custody case in which a 15-year old girl with a complex diagnosis was taken into custody by Massachusetts protective services. Boston Children’s Hospital was providing care to the girl and so got embroiled in the controversy.\nThe series of attacks started in March with the posting of sensitive employee data. The attacks eventually expanded to include DDoS attacks that threatened to take down the hospital’s network. Boston Children’s is a very advanced provider in terms of use of technology, with providers highly dependent on digital records and network connectivity to provide clinical care. An inability to access systems has potentially far-reaching clinical impacts, up to and including a loss of life.\nHence the connection back to the more recent attack against the Presbyterian Medical Center.  According to the hospital and their coverage, the attack did cause disruption, though reportedly not patient care compromise. One of the more alarming aspects of the coverage of the attack was at least one security expert suggesting that when faced with a ransom attack “it’s usually cheaper to pay the ransom than fix the problem.” That’s disturbing advice. Even if you dismiss the potential scenario that attacks will continue past the point of payment, the idea of not addressing the systemic issue should be purged from IT and security team’s thinking, not encouraged.\n [You might also like: As Cyber Security Programs Lose Their Moorings to Ransom-DoS: Radware Introduces the Ultimate Guide to Cyber Ransom]\nWhile the attack against Presbyterian Medical Center has died down from a mass media perspective, speculation continues as to the source of the breach. One strong possibility is that it stemmed from a JBOSS vulnerability within a medical device being used within the hospital, as this vulnerability has been exploited previously in a hack of Hospira MedNet a year ago. This highlights the potential impact of IoT and hack-prone devices being connected to networks that access sensitive data to administer critical care.\nPrepare for More Emotional Exposure Tied to Ransom\nFor many years, the discussion around ransom attacks and how to respond centered on three main factors: credibility of the threat, identification/cost of remediation (i.e., solving the actual security problem), and the impact of breach, outage, or core threat. This last piece has typically been a business assessment, but how do the dynamics of ransom attacks change when the implications of not avoiding the impact (perhaps through payment, but more effectively through improved security) become more of an emotional or even life or death situation? We saw the potential of this type of threat with the Ashley Madison hack where numerous organizations approached names on the list claiming they would remove them from the list for some fee.\nThere are ebbs and flows in the motives behind modern cyber-security attacks. But there is no denying that old line that “money is the root of all evil” and that attacks tied to financial gain, either overtly or covertly are starting to take advantage of our increased dependence on the network. IoT promises to only accelerate the aspects of our day-to-day lives that are wholly network-dependent.  Incidents like the Presbyterian Medical Center attack highlights to all of us, the importance of pushing the security controls to a level where we can be confident that a ransom threat won’t force us to respond emotionally.\n\nDownload the “Cyber Ransom Survival Guide: The Growing Threat of Ransomware and RDoS – and What to Do About It” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'data breach\', \'network security\', \'Ransomware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/03/ransomware-and-iot-attacks-continue/');

Youngsters saw having their tablets and phones taken away as the worst method of punishment.’\n\nLet’s put aside for now the question of whether or not a parent taking away a child’s tablet is something like a new form of DDOS attack (a parental one) and consider the ‘old’ form of punishment, the more familiar one– taking away some kind of treat, like candy. I don’t know if any formal studies have been done where children (or adults) are asked, which ‘treat’ they would rather lose, Internet or candy, but more and more I suspect it is communications they’d rather keep. That’s right—I think people would rather have Internet and go hungry than be full but off-line.\nThis is really pretty interesting because we can start to consider whether or not Internet access is at least as important to people as food or candy—the latter is a requirement to stay alive, but as far as I know, the human body has no daily requirement for connectivity or phones. Riding around on the train, or just walking in the street, you’ll see countless people with their heads angled down, looking at their screens and veering away just at the last possible second away from an open manhole or from an oncoming taxi. Overwhelmingly, what these people are looking at is communications—emails, texts, URL’s sent by friends, etc. There is no google, no Facebook, no email and pretty much no iPad without the Internet and without communications.\nIt may or may not be clear what the above has to do with DDOS, and it may or may not be clear what the above has to do with business. So let me explain.\nDo. Not. Let. Your. Network. Go. Down.\n [You might also like: Networks Can Fail. Here’s What You Can Do About It]\nI hope that is clear.\nIf you own a business, or manage one, or have a vested interest in one, or are responsible for its growth, your network may well be your most important asset. If it isn’t number one, it is in the top 3. Without it, your employees are lost, your partners cannot communicate with you, and worst of all, your customers cannot place orders, may lose faith in you, and may jump to the competition. Want to see an unhappy child? Take away their Internet. Want to see an unhappy customer? Take away their Internet.\nI’ve argued before that very few things in the business realm can so swiftly decimate a business as a security breach. Not earthquake, nor tornado, not even war. Yet from a business perspective, Internet access is assumed, it is a given. I’m not sure there is any other area of business that is so vitally important and yet is just assumed. Good employees are not assumed, nor is growth, nor is brand equity, nor is operational excellence. But stable communications are assumed.\nThis is a big mistake—or to put it in a more business-friendly language, this represents less than ideal risk management. The fact is that no one understands the value of communications and network access better than attackers—that is, attackers really do understand the value of networking to your business, and they may understand this better than many business people do. They understand that if they can turn off your Internet (via DDOS attack), you might pay six figures to get the network back up and running. To them, launching a DDOS attack (which might cost as little as $100 with possible returns in the millions, via ransom) makes good business sense. To them, increasingly, DDOS attacks are a good ‘entrepreneurial’ opportunity, a way of pretty simply making a lot of money. Or, they may not like your stance on some political issue. Or they may not like a country you do business in. Or they may just not like you.\nYet there is a certain casualness with which businesses regard their networks. This attitude is probably changing, but not quickly enough. Sure, networks are technical things, and Board Members are not going to get involved with router configurations. But should today’s businesses incorporate IT robustness and Internet availability into their complete, corporate risk management programs? Yes they should.\nTo turn it the other way, businesses without clear plans on how to deal with network outages and DDOS attacks are basically putting their future into the hands of would-be attackers, who can launch attacks in a matter of moments, with no expertise, and for little to no money. At any moment, the Internet can turn into a war zone, and your business’ future can suddenly become at risk. You need to start planning for these kinds of eventualities—in short, to incorporate network and IT security firmly into corporate risk management. You need to imagine what happens to your business when the network goes down, consider the real costs of that, and what you can do to mitigate that risk sensibly.\nOtherwise your customers may start crying like children who have had their candy (or tablets) taken away.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'availability\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'Hackers\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/03/your-internet-or-your-candy/');

In the first line of defense.”  Trying to improve my chances, I quickly added, “You know what, it’s when employees share on social networks and unintentionally provide puzzle pieces to potential perpetrators.”\n“No,” he said. “It happens in the CISO’s mind. At the very moment they feel secure enough…”\n\nThat was an interesting statement and come to think about it, he did have a point. If threats are becoming more and more sophisticated, then security countermeasures have to evolve at the same pace and in the same direction.\nWhat Will The Next Attack Look Like?\nMany organizations still believe that if they upgrade their infrastructure, they can contain a DDoS attack – increase pipe capacity, add more cables, add network resources and components to be able to absorb a larger amount of traffic. Or alternatively – in extreme cases – dump traffic.  It doesn’t have to be this way though and this will not stop multi-vector attacks.\nAttackers have learned very well about the security solutions in the market and they have a good notion of the trends and heuristics that security experts follow.  They are translating these lessons to more sophisticated tools, such as APDoS (Advanced Persistent Denial-of-Service) and Burst Attacks (AKA Hit-and-run DDoS).  In their latest industry report, Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) has indicated a growing use in these new formats.\n [You might also like: Is Your Organization Prepared for Cyber Attacks? The 2015-2016 Global Application & Network Security Report]\nSerious New Threats\nAPDoS is an ongoing DDoS attack that continues until the attacker stops the attack or the host server is able to defend against it.  Since the attack is persistent, APDoS is essentially a potpourri of attack types and will most likely involve multiple vectors aimed at all network layers simultaneously.\nA typical APDoS campaign combines massive network-layer DDoS attacks and focused application layer (HTTP) floods, followed by repeated SQLI and XSS attacks occurring at varying intervals.  This can send up to tens of millions requests per second.  Now imagine that, together with the good old volumetric attack in the form of large SYN Floods, and a relatively new vector – secure-SMTP (TLS over SMTP).\nAPDoS attacks can persist for weeks at a time, challenging the resources of even the most sophisticated security infrastructures.\nToday’s threats drive demand for automated defenses and rapid analysis and mitigation.  Think of your company for a second, is it prepared to mitigate an APDoS attack?  Unfortunately, many organizations rely on dated techniques, like trying to synchronize multi-vendor solutions – this is a patchwork of solutions that require heavy manual intervention.\nThe rise of APDoS attacks represents an emerging threat demanding more advanced detection and mitigation and true partnership with DDoS mitigation service providers. Attackers are demonstrating more patience and persistence, leveraging “low and slow” attack techniques that misuse application resources rather than those in network stacks. Attackers are using evasive techniques to avoid detection and mitigation; including SSL-based attacks and changing the page request in an HTTP page flood attack.\nAPDoS will become a hacktivists’ preferred technique and it was used in the attack against ProtonMail.\nBurst Attacks aka “Hit-and-Run DDoS” use short bursts of high volume attacks in random intervals, spanning a time frame of days or weeks.  These attacks lead to frequent and inconsistent disruptions in the network server’s SLA and can prevent legitimate users from using a service.\n [You might also like: Dry Lighting Cracks Against the Cloud – The Rise of Advanced Persistent DoS (APDoS)]\nHit-and-Run DDoS require access to extensive resources (computing power, botnet, applications) in order to launch high volume attacks in short bursts.  Each burst can last short periods of time – sometimes several minutes – until the server goes down. The bursts may repeat every few hours during the span of the operation.\nBursts are also sometimes used as a test. An attacker will inject a few bad packets into a network to test if it is online and functioning.  Hit-and-Run DDoS exploits anti-DDoS software and services that are used to defend against prolonged DDoS attacks.  Activating such software can take longer than the actual attack, allowing a denial of service before DDoS protection can start to defend from the attack or learn its traffic pattern – since they too may be altered during the attack.\n\nNew Threats Require New Methods\nBurst attacks are becoming more and more common. Though volumetric in nature, the volumes are on a much higher scale and this introduces the risk of Internet pipe saturation.  A hybrid solution that includes on-premise protection to detect and mitigation the attacks in real-time, coupled with on-demand cloud protection for those volumetric attacks is the best approach here.\nAnalyzing recent Burst Attacks, Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) indicated a growing use of automated, bot-based operations that generate large volumes of traffic in a short period of time.  Maintaining these peaks over a long period of time will essentially create an APDoS.\nReturning to that CISO’s approach, my conclusion is that just like the perpetrators that are improving their offensive tools we need to keep our protective systems smart and adaptive.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"Could Your Network Survive APDoS or Hit-and-Run DDoS?\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/02/could-your-network-survive-apdos/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Ben Zilberman\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beyond-volumetric-attacks-sharks.png\",\n        \"height\": 547,\n        \"width\": 380\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2016-02-25\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2016-02-26\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'data breach\', \'DDoS attack\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/02/could-your-network-survive-apdos/');

At each level, the appropriate manager decides which of the precious dollars, assets, and personnel under his or her control should be allocated for each aspect of the business, security being one of the many competing functions.\n\nMany of the management ranks have ascended from technical positions and leverage that knowledge to ask the right questions to create a clear picture of various business issues and their solutions. Having a relevant technical background is a significant asset, especially to first line and midlevel managers when addressing the technical side of issues. However, technical troubleshooting is not in their daily job description, especially at the director and above levels. In fact, for managers at that level, it can be years since they have placed hands on a keyboard to resolve an issue. This is rightfully so, as this is what the architects, engineers, administrators, analysts, and other operational professionals were hired to do.\n\nThough it is well known that management is responsible for security, they are often not the most prepared to make the technical decisions. This is where management goes awry, especially those that have risen from the technical ranks. At some point, each manager comes to a juncture where he or she decides whether they are going to trust the people they hire to do their jobs, allowing him or her to focus on other business needs. Many managers, especially those that have risen from the technical ranks, seem to feel the need to continue making technical decisions, especially those pertaining to solutions for business needs. I have seen this time and time again. When this occurs, the manager is creating a situation where negative messages are conveyed.\n [You might also like: Expectation Management – What Can Vendor Management Systems Do For You?]\nThe astute manager assesses the strengths of their personnel and also leverages their expertise and judgment around not only technical issues, but also operational issues within their respective areas. This is a tough step for many managers, especially with disciplines as politically sensitive and operationally critical as security. However, security personnel are in the trenches providing support and business value via their various roles on a daily basis. More senior personnel, such as emergency response teams, architects, tier 3 analysts, and operators, have been doing their job for years and have shown aptitude for those roles or they wouldn’t be there. Given their tenure, they should be well equipped to articulate key requirements and associated features.\nAllowing the senior technical personnel to choose a solution not only lets management focus on management issues, it provides multiple benefits to the organization and the technical individuals involved. First and foremost, it shows trust in them on behalf of management, which is a motivator. Second, by acknowledging them as stakeholders and allowing them to make the decision, they become directly accountable for the success of their function, thus making them responsible for their own success. Third, those individuals that excel in this capacity demonstrate their management capabilities to their superiors, thus creating a career growth opportunity for them when an appropriate position opens and provides the company the opportunity to promote from within, all of which create tangible and political benefits.\nStarting the process of bringing in your technical pros is not as daunting as it may seem.  Look to your peers for suggestions on who they’d recommend to include on the meetings.  From there, bring those individuals into the process early – for several reasons. They may have previous experience with the solutions or vendors that you are vetting or specific knowledge on new trends. They also may have the insider knowledge to ask the questions that you could be missing.

When a DDoS protection solution is deployed on-premise, organizations benefit from an immediate and automatic attack detection and DDoS mitigation solution. Within seconds from the start of an attack, the online services are well protected and the attack is mitigated.\n\nHowever, on-premise DDoS solutions cannot handle volumetric network floods that saturate the Internet pipe of the enterprise. Cloud solutions require the deployment of an overlay infrastructure that collects network statistics from various end points and redirects customer traffic to scrubbing centers for attack cleansing. Cloud DDoS protection solutions can remove volumetric attacks; however, they lack visibility into application level attacks, low and slow DDoS attacks, and encrypted attacks.\nNetwork-as-a-Sensor:  Extend Attack Detection to SMEs\nAt Cisco Live Berlin, Mike Geller and Ehud Doron presented at DevNet a new approach: Network-as-a-Sensor.\n\n\nThis approach is designed for small to medium enterprises (SMEs), which are, eventually, the mass market. Today, SMEs are forced to use cloud solutions because on-premise solution costs are too high. With this new approach DefenseFlow DDoS defense software is installed on existing routing solution (in the case of the DevNet session – Cisco ISR) and it acts as a virtual behavioral detection sensor.\n [You might also like: Cloud-Based or Provider-Managed DDoS Mitigation – Which One is Right For Your Organization?]\nDefenseFlow client signals attack information (rather than network statistics) to a central automated cyber incidents response server (DefenseFlow Server) using DOTS (DDoS Open Threat Signaling) protocol.

In our recent Global Application & Network Security Report we predicted an increase in complex encrypted attack vectors and the importance of putting in place adequate defenses that can scale and inspect encrypted traffic.  Just last week, we got a vivid example of the increasing threat posed by encrypted attack vectors. A high profile attack occurred with an organization that had both a combination of on-premises and cloud-based DDoS protection, yet the organization’s site still went down, in large part because the attack “hid” from detection by the cloud-based resources by using encryption.\n\nThe clear and unfortunate reality is that attackers are on to the impact they can have by encrypting their attacks. Organizations looking at cloud-only solutions need to be aware of this growing trend and factor this into their thinking on what ultimately is the best solution for complete protection.\n\nWhy are attackers increasing their use of encrypted attacks? There are two main reasons. First, the encryption of the traffic allows the attack to evade detection by an unfortunate percentage of the DDoS protection products and services on the market. Many of those that do claim to provide protection from encrypted attacks suffer significant performance degradation when hit with encrypted traffic, meaning that to build a suitable solution with these technologies would require over-provisioning and buying extra gear to compensate from the performance drop. The other reason we’re seeing more attackers turn to encrypted attack vectors is they understand that encrypted traffic puts an extra burden on all the computing resources within the application stack. As a result, they can generate “successful” attacks with a much lower level of total traffic when it is encrypted.\n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\nThere are two clear factors challenging protection in the cloud against an attack like this. First is the ability of most cloud-based resources to inspect encrypted traffic.  In most cases, this capability is severely limited because most providers require sharing of private keys for the certificate of the protected server. Most organizations balk at this and in so doing the (typically unknowingly) pass on protection from encrypted attacks. Without the ability to decrypt the traffic, most cloud providers simply pass encrypted traffic along to the protected server.\nThis doesn’t have to be the case. Radware’s encrypted attack solution allows any certificate issued by the organization to manage the traffic decryption to identify attack traffic and isolate it for mitigation.\nSecond, this attack highlighted that even within the category of encrypted attacks, there is considerable innovation and creativity being employed by attackers. SSL attack detection and mitigation solutions that do not use challenge-and-response capabilities to more accurately differentiate between legitimate users and bots will leave customers exposed. Detection of only known attack patterns for encrypted attack vectors means that all encrypted attacks that do not fit predefined attack profiles will be passed along to the target server, and more likely than not, will result in an outage.\nThe fact that the organization that was the target of last week’s attack did have both on-premise and cloud-based protection yet still went down also highlights the importance of single-vendor hybrid solutions. The use of separate technologies on-premises and in the cloud creates a number of complicating factors for effective protection. Chief among them is the common lack of coordination when dealing with attacks. It’s an easy decision when you see attack traffic coming into your environment to swing all traffic to a cloud-based scrubbing resource, hoping they can clean the traffic. But the lack of visibility into the full nature of the attack and the inability to inspect encrypted traffic flows in this case resulted in the cloud scrubbing provider to return enough of that traffic to the target assets to take them down.\nIt’s customary for us to make a number of predictions in our annual report on the threat landscape. At the end of the year when we go back and look at which ones came to fruition, it’s with a mixed set of emotions… it’s nice to know when we’ve provided solid advice to the industry but also disappointing to see that as a community we have not successfully progressed our ability to protect from that which we saw coming. Here’s hoping more organizations learn from last week’s attack and heed the warnings on the growing threat of encrypted attacks.\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'Encryption\', \'Hybrid Security\', \'network security\', \'SSL Attacks\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/02/cyber-attackers-are-adjusting/');

In the last 10 years, I have never received a message like this from him.  I gave him a call and my manager told me that my wife’s credit card was compromised. An unknown person had used it for shopping at a sporting goods store in the US and to set up a VPN account to hide his criminal activities.\n\nLuckily for us, the bank and the credit card supplier identified this fraud right away and disabled the card immediately.\nHow Did This Happen?\nTo get closer to an answer let me provide some background about how my wife usually uses her credit card.  The card is usually used for only few online websites and for nothing else (no other stores, gas stations, hotels, or restaurants).  We always use the same computer with an up-to-date anti-virus (AV) / anti-phishing program and on top of this I run an offline AV scan once a week with a different tool.\nSo, why did the card still get compromised? Honestly, we don’t know.  There can be multiple reasons and we still are investigating, but there are many ways criminals can get a hold on credit card data.  Remember back in 2012 when Global Payments was hacked and more than 10 M credit card numbers were stolen. Also more recently in Europe, tens of thousands of cards began to be replaced pro-actively by several banks because of compromised databases and “possibly” stolen card numbers.  These are options we’ve considered.\n\nAnother popular source for thieves is to spy on credit card information when users are shopping online.  This can happen by cyber-criminals successfully installing malicious software on your computer through infected attachments in emails.  Once inside, this software can access and affect other entries and activities. Another commonly used method is the redirection from popular websites to spoofed websites operated by the criminals.\nCan This Happen To You?\nThe lesson here is that this kind of cyber-crime can happen to everyone!  There is no 100% protection against the misuse of your credit card available. This is the reality and it’s important to keep this in mind.\n [You might also like: Fraud on the Darknet: How to Own Over 1 Million Usernames and Passwords]\nUsing a credit card may be safer than having a lot of cash on hand and when shopping online, there is almost no alternative – no matter if you purchase a new smartphone app or a book. The plastic cards are convenient, despite the potential risks. You just have to make sure that your “virtual pockets” are not wide open to thieves and cyber-criminals.\nRemember These Tips & Guidelines To Avoid Online Credit Theft\nNever give your credit card to anyone.\nAlthough this seems obvious, this rule can be difficult to follow. Maybe you give your card to the waiter, who then uses it somewhere else.  Maybe you lend the card to your partner or your kids.  To prevent potential misuse, you need to keep an eye on your card at all times.  This is even more important when you use the card abroad or have additional account cards for your family.\n\nDo not use your credit card in an unsafe place.   Using the card at an ATM right on the road and in locations with poor visibility is a risk.  It’s easy for criminals to install a so-called skimmer that can steal card details and PIN codes. I also do not recommend using your card in very small shops and businesses with older or potentially outdated payment equipment.\nDo not tell anyone your PIN code.  Nobody has the right to ask you for your credit card PIN. No exception.  Also, (and it may seem obvious) don’t write down your code and have this with your card. If you are afraid that you’ll forget the code, use the password manager that is available.  If you have concerns that your PIN code has been stolen, inform your bank immediately.\nReport any problem you have with your card.  If you have any kind of problem – for example you lost of your card or you see unknown purchases on your credit card statement – you should inform your bank immediately. Time is the most important factor because thieves and scammers will try to abuse your stolen card as soon as possible.\nMake sure that online payments are processed from a secure system. For your computer to not be infected by malicious programs, an up-to-date AV program is a must.  Your network should be protected and your online connection must be encrypted.\nBeware of Phishing. Phishing e-mails are a popular theft tactic.  These mass emails look like regular emails from big banks, known online retailers, or online providers and they often tell the recipient that they have to “Confirm Account” or evaluate suspicious withdrawals. If you click on the included link, it will take you to a fake page of the Bank/Distributor/provider that prompts you to enter your password or credit card information.  Do not click on the link, under no circumstances.\n\nThere will be never be 100% security when you use a Credit Card.  However, these guidelines and tips can help to keep you safer when using your credit card in the real and cyber world.\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'data theft\', \'information security\', \'Phishing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/02/online-credit-theft-happened-to-me/');

The  group claiming responsibility for the attack was New World Hackers and various  articles have been published with one of the group members providing interviews  about the incident. One of the main claims was that it was performed using  Amazon by bypassing Amazon’s security measures and using administrative  privileges. \n\nAmazon has a huge amount of infrastructure resources that  are available to its users and the risk of abuse of these resources (like  launching a mega DDoS attack) has been previously debated. \nWhat Does it Actually Take to Generate a High-Volume  Attack Using Amazon’s infrastructure?\nAmazon on its side has employed several techniques to  prevent this from happening as found in their AWS  Security Whitepaper.  Let’s look at some  of the important ones and their meaning for generating a big attack:\n\nAnti-Spoofing: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)  instances cannot send spoofed network traffic. The AWS-controlled, host-based  firewall infrastructure will not permit an instance to send traffic with a  source IP or MAC address other than its own. This means that almost all network  layer attacks which result in high volumes such as spoofed floods, reflection  and amplification floods, are ruled out.\nNetwork Monitoring and Protection: AWS  utilizes a wide variety of automated monitoring systems to provide a high level  of service performance and availability. AWS monitoring tools are designed to  detect unusual or unauthorized activities and conditions at ingress and  egress communication points. These tools monitor server and network usage,  port scanning activities, application usage, and unauthorized intrusion  attempts. The tools have the ability to set custom performance metric  thresholds for unusual activity. Hence, any unusual volume leaving the  environment is expected to be detected and cause the relevant nodes to be shut  down.\nDDoS Protection:  A proprietary protection system is deployed. While  detailed description of the system is not exposed, there is some additional  level of monitoring and automated protection which is targeted at protecting  those systems. \nAbuse Reporting: Amazon customers can  report an abuse of an Amazon account. Each report is investigated by the Amazon  abuse team and actions are taken accordingly. So supposedly, an attack would  have been reported and actions taken in a timely manner to resolve them.\nAdditional Measures: Access control,  anti-scanning, encryption and segregation are also measures which are  indirectly employed in order to prevent such cases.\n\n [You might also like: Static Cloud Security is Obsolete: Long Live Continuously Adaptive Cloud Security!]\n How likely is it that  the attack was indeed performed by Amazon? While we recognize that a  high-volume attack would be a very challenging task, let’s take a different  approach – what if the attack was not so high volume? What if it was more  sophisticated and cunning instead?  \nEnter the Dynamic IP Attack – An Equally Devastating Outcome\nDynamic IP attacks target the application layer. They use a  real IP address to generate a 3-way handshake with the server and are also able  to bypass mitigation techniques such as JavaScript challenges. By distributing  such attacks well, an attacker can make it almost impossible to distinguish  between attackers and legitimate users. \nVarious techniques are also employed in efforts to evade  common defense mechanisms. Examples of these are the usage of headless  browsers, evasion techniques, encryption, and specific user-like behaviors.  When such an attack is well distributed across a large number of sources, it can  also mean a low rate per each source used, making it impossible for even  application rate limits to detect. If such an attack is generated out of a  major public cloud infrastructure, there is also an additional challenge for  mitigation systems, as public cloud ranges are not so easily added to access  lists as a whole without compromising normal operational requirements. \nLet’s re-examine dynamic IP attacks against the security  measures described above:\n\nAnti-Spoofing: Application attacks  require a full session anyway therefore no IP spoofing is relevant and actual  sessions will be created. Nevertheless, the IP can be changed frequently using  the huge ranges Amazon has to offer.\nNetwork Monitoring and Protection: A  sophisticated attack will use a low bandwidth per each source node and will use  high distribution in order to hide it. Such that each source looks legitimate.\nDDoS Protection:  The low volume of the attack will keep it  under the radar of any monitoring and it will converge only at the final  destination. In this destination it will still be very hard to distinguish friend  from foe. \nAbuse Reporting: In order to report an  abuse, one first needs to identify the source which is abusing them and  attribute them to Amazon. This is nearly an impossible task when sources behave  so much like normal users. \nAdditional Measures: An attack can be  generated with the above attributes and still fall within the reasonable usage  criteria, while using only accepted actions within the normal enforcement  policy. \n\nSo, to conclude, the task of generating an attack using  Amazon or any other public cloud service would not be easy given existing  security measures but we did see most measures which are designed to prevent  the traditional, network related, type of DDoS attacks. We believe attackers  are increasingly aware of high complexity attacks that are becoming harder to  detect and handle, but at the same time may be equally devastating. \n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AWS\', \'Cloud Security\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/public-cloud-the-ultimate-attack-tool/');

Overall weaknesses are spread fairly evenly, suggesting a true protection gap for most organizations today.\n\nAlso this year, we’ve included 3rd party viewpoints from both Bell Business Markets and Atos that share with us their perspective of the threat landscape and how organizations can be more prepared.\n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\nShift in Motives and Impact\nThis year’s report also looks at the shift in attacker motivation and this overall impact on the business.  Some interesting trends include the increase in ransom-based attacks and the fact that most organizations still do not know the motivation behind cyber-attacks.  Most are in the dark when it comes to “why” they were attacked.  The increase in ransom attacks is very apparent in the market and is showcased in the report with the recent attacks on ProtonMail.\nThe Growing Need for Security Automation\nRadware’s ERT report takes a deep dive into the rise in automated attacks and how organizations should be preparing.  We cover this in detail in our discussion on Dynamic IP Attacks and the battle between “good” and “bad” bots.  These automated attacks are an indication of the rise of advanced persistent denial-of-service (APDoS) attacks. These attacks represent a clear and emerging threat demanding more advanced detection and mitigation and, more often than not, true partnership with DDoS mitigation service providers.\nThe need for automated, advanced attack detection is further exemplified through the case of a major US-based airline that dealt with the rise in automated attacks and the sophistication of application-layer attacks. This airline battle bad bots that acted as faux buyers, which caused the airline’s inventory to essentially be held hostage. The case demonstrates what the airline did to protect its applications from advanced bots and how website operators need more advanced user and client identification that can detect and block illegitimate users.\nWhat Changed in Security From 2015?\nWhether you want to know more about today’s attack vector landscape, understand the business impact of cyber-attacks on organizations, or learn more about emerging attack types and tools, this report is for you.  It provides a comprehensive and objective review of 2015 cyber-attacks from both a business and technical perspective.\nView the executive summary or\n\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/2015-2016-global-application-network-security-report/');

Cybersecurity spending on both workforce and software solutions will increase – Andrew Borene, IBM i2 Safer Planet\nI share Andrew Borene’s opinion that spending on cybersecurity workforce and solutions will increase.  We know that cyber security is an active industry but the demand for knowledgeable people continues to increase.  Workforce spending will likely be both in the salary of hiring new employees with in-demand skills as well as training existing staff on security and security hardware.\nFinally, Dan Lohrmann wrote a nice blog for Govtech.com that compiled the predictions of many companies (including these) which you can find here.  2016 will most certainly be an interesting year in cybersecurity.  Be on the lookout for Radware’s 2016 predictions in our upcoming Global Application & Network Security Report!\n\nLearn more about cyber-attack detection and trends in the 2016 Global Application and Network Security Report.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'cybersecurity\', \'Data Breaches\', \'hacktivism\', \'IoT\', \'network security\', \'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/cyber-security-predictions-2016/');

The vast majority of headline-making data breaches in recent years all started with spear phishing attacks.\nSpear Phishing:   The Art of Seduction\nFirst, the attacker chooses a victim, let’s say www.contoso.com.  The attacker then uses a dynamic DNS service and a virtual server, so they can publish their own similar site.  Something similar in name like www.comtoso.com, assuming that users may not notice the minor change in the URL.\nIn the second phase, the attacker copies the www.contoso.com site using scraping tools or data-harvesting tools such as Automation Anywhere or Ion.  Now the attacker has a lookalike site under the name www.comtoso.com.  All that is left for them to do, is to draw victim users to the fake site so visitors can insert their credentials.  The attacker’s next step is to collect as many email addresses as possible by using fingerprinting tools like Foca and Maltego.\n\nNow the attacker has to wait for a user to log in to the bogus site using valid Contoso credentials and they can collect them. Then, as attackers often say, it’s game over.\n [You might also like: DNS and DNS Attacks]\nAnti-Phishing Techniques\nAnti-phishing products and services have also been around for quite some time and they occupy a significant area of the cyber security industry. Antivirus programs now often include anti-phishing features and most browsers are automatically equipped with Google Safe Browsing; this combination provides a moderate level of anti-phishing protection, but is not enough to protect a company against a sophisticated attack.\n Anti-phishing solutions can be integrated into web browsers or can operate in a standalone way and frequently they use similar methods to detect phishing attacks.\nDomain reputation\nAll anti-phishing vendors collect intelligence about URL blacklists.  They do this by using reputation analysis technology for domain reputation and data information, such as black-listed top level domains (TLDs). There are some sites that will provide you with this information for free – http://www.borderware.com/ is one example. The information from these services can also come from mailing block lists and reported sites.\nThe downside to this method is that most attackers will use techniques like ‘throw-away’ in which they obtain domain names to employ malicious URLs, but for only brief periods of time. This enables them to fly under the radar of URL blacklists and reputation analysis technology.\nPhishing Alerts for Registrars and Hosting Providers\nRegistrars, hosting providers and ISPs are able to provide a footprint of their IP addresses, name servers and Whois servers.  Their anti-phishing software is continuously updated and can provide alerts to users based on this information.\n [You might also like: 5 Cyber Attack Developments Worth Your Attention]\nToolbars\nThere are different toolbars that can be installed on today’s most popular browsers. These toolbars constantly monitor the URL searches and report back to the software in order to match the rule-based policy.\nDNS Search Protection\nUsing this method of protection, domains that are deceptively similar to legitimate websites are logged in repositories.  The software monitors DNS registrations daily for specific alert patterns and also probes potential domains at common TLDs and register points like .com, .net, .free.fr.\nSSL Site Search Protection\nPhishing attacks that make use of SSL certificates are especially dangerous, as most users associate the presence of a valid SSL certificate with an increased level of assurance. Some products have the ability to search over five million SSL certificates for forgeries.\nAwareness\nThe most important and effective way to safeguard against phishing attacks is through the education of employees and the heightening of their awareness of social engineering attacks.  Many organizations offer education programs abut security and these enable users to become more aware of the most current risks and threats.\nThe bottom line is that the problem lies somewhere between the chair and the keyboard.  It is ultimately up to the end user to read all emails and alerts with a critical eye and decide whether the information and the links are safe or not.  As long as the decision is in the hands of the user, the chances of success in phishing attacks will remain high and that’s exactly what keeps the anti-phishing industry growing.  Organizations will keep searching for solutions, and anti-phishing technology must continue to develop in accordance with this demand.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'data breach\', \'information security\', \'network security\', \'Phishing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/ways-to-protect-against-modern-day-spear-phishing/');

They had to replace a gasket on the engine because it was leaking a bit of oil. When they looked at the problem, they told me that I should replace a few other parts.\nThis was interesting because the parts were working and not causing any issues. The parts they wanted to replace were reasonably inexpensive, but in order to get to the failing gasket they had to spend a lot of time taking apart the engine. The time and labor to dismantle my engine outweighed the cost of the parts that they recommended replacing. It made sense to do this other work at the same time while they were easy to access. In the long run, this would save me money by not having to take apart the engine later when these components would eventually go bad.\n\n\nWhen I look at ADC technologies, I can apply a similar principle. The ADC is acting as a proxy for connections to the applications it is supporting. This means that the ADC is often decrypting the traffic using the information it can see to steer the session to the appropriate server. Decrypting and encrypting application content is resource intensive and ADCs are built to offer high performance encryption functionality.\nDo once, leverage twice\nWeb application firewalls (WAF) are solutions that inspect content going to servers and block malicious content that can cause problems or exploit vulnerabilities. Since the ADC is already decrypting the session if it encrypted, it makes sense to leverage this work and also pass the session to a WAF to make sure no vulnerabilities are being exposed.\n [You might also like: Security Threats Are Like a Box of Chocolates]\nThe optimal way to do this is to integrate the WAF technology into the ADC so the functions can be performed seamlessly in a single solution to deliver all of your traffic steering and web security functions. This is much easier to deploy and manage compared to a multi-box and multi-vendor solution.\nIntegrating means enhancing\nKeeping this in mind, we can take this a step further. The benefit increases if we are able to add the WAF functionality to the ADC solution. But, only if we can ensure that the WAF does not become a bottleneck or impact the performance of the access to the application.\nNow, we are talking about an out-of-path WAF where the ADC is decrypting the traffic once, and steering it to the appropriate application server. At the same time, the ADC can replicate the decrypted session to the WAF for the security inspection. Then, if a threat is detected, the WAF can notify the appropriate security mitigation solutions to block the attacker and protect the application.\nJust like my car maintenance where my mechanic is telling me to dismantle the engine once to perform multiple tasks, we need to see how we can leverage the capabilities built into ADC technologies to make the functionality of the WAF more efficient. In this case, we also obtain an enhanced benefit where we can reduce the impact of the WAF on application performance and availability by taking it out of path while retaining its functionality.\n\n\nRead “Keep It Simple; Make It Scalable: 6 Characteristics of the Futureproof Load Balancer” to learn more.\nDownload Now\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'data center\', \'Firewalls\', \'web performance\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2016/01/how-integrating-application-delivery-and-a-firewall/');

The most common attack in 2015 was the combined attack.\nProtonMail experienced one of the biggest combined attacks recorded this year.  Struck with multiple methods, the attack lasted on and off for two days and at its peak, it reached 80 Gbps of traffic.\n\n2. We were introduced to the massive 40Gbps Root DNS attack on Turkish servers executed by Anonymous.\nThis was only the third time that root servers have been targeted in a significant sustained attack. The most significant, back in 2007, saw a botnet containing roughly 5,000 computers swamp four root servers with traffic, taking down two of them for several hours in two waves of attacks.\n [You might also like: How to Prepare for a DDoS Attack]\n3. The DNS Reflection DDoS attack became more common.\nThe third most common DDoS attack in 2015 as recorded by the Radware ERT was this type of attack that can produce a large volume of traffic in a short period.  The attacker sends spoofed specially-crafted queries to open recursive servers to result in a very large response.\n4. Another frequent attack that Radware ERT faced in 2015 was the UDP Fragmentation attack.\nThis attack is executed against a target server in an attempt to consume resources, such as bandwidth and CPU.  In some cases, the result of a “DNS amplification” attack will be fragmented UDP packets. DNS protocol uses UDP packets on port 53 and because of the amplification; the server has to fragment the packets. In 2015 Radware’s ERT analysts recorded many UDP fragmentation attacks against several of our customers in the financial services sector.\n5. The most familiar DDoS attack seen was the SYN flood attack.\nAlthough it is very likely to be detected and mitigated, attackers keep using this method for DDoS. These attacks quickly consume the resources of a target server or its intermediate communications equipment. This kind of attack also indicates the use of “Booters” or “Stressers” because often that is the first attack option these services use.\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop DDoS attacks.\nDownload Now\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"The Top 5 DDoS Attack Types We Saw in 2015\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/top-ddos-attacks-2015/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Snir Karat\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tips-before-during-after-cyber-attack.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1025,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2016-01-07\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2016-01-07\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2016/01/top-ddos-attacks-2015/');

A passion of mine in addition to IT Security (and, of course, supporting our customers) is to climb mountains. What is the link between this and IT Security? More than you might think.\n\nWhen you climb a mountain during winter, at high elevations, or when you ski in deep snow (like a helicopter skiing tour) one of the most dangerous risks is to get hit by an avalanche. For all the “flat country” folks, an avalanche is the rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface.\n Avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche. Although primarily composed of flowing snow and air, large avalanches can also entrain ice, rocks, trees, and other material in its path. If a person is trapped by an avalanche, timing is everything. The faster you find a victim, the better chance there is for survival.\nAvalanches are not rare or random and they are endemic to any mountain range that accumulates a standing snowpack.  Due to this, many preventative measures are employed in areas where avalanches pose a significant threat to people – areas like ski resorts, mountain towns, roads, and railways.\nThere are several ways to prevent avalanches and lessen their power and destruction. These active preventative measures reduce the likelihood and size of avalanches by disrupting the structure of the snowpack, while passive measures reinforce and stabilize the snowpack.\nThe Virtual Avalanche\n\nIn an IT infrastructure, a similar risk is a volumetric DDoS attack. These attacks can create severe damage and service outages. They are like virtual avalanches for your infrastructure.\nDDoS attacks that target network resources attempt to consume all of a victim’s network bandwidth by using a large volume of illegitimate traffic to saturate the company’s Internet pipe. These attacks, called network floods, are simple yet effective.  In a typical flooding attack, the offense is distributed among an army of thousands of volunteered or compromised computers—a botnet—that sends a huge amount of junk traffic to the targeted site, overwhelming its network and the devices providing a specific service on this network.\nVolumetric flood attacks are detected by an on-premise DoS/ DDoS protection device located at the perimeter. Once detected, mitigation starts immediately. However, attack volume threatens to saturate the Internet pipe. Soon, the pipe has been saturated and the organization is losing business, because the services are not available anymore.\nTo effectively mitigate all types of DDoS attacks, multiple protection tools are needed.\n\nCloud DoS protection to mitigate volumetric attacks that threaten to saturate the Internet pipe.\nDoS protection to detect and mitigate all types of network DDoS attacks.\nBehavioral Analysis to protect against application DDoS and misuse attacks. Those attacks are harder to detect and appear like legitimate traffic so they can go unnoticed without a behavioral analysis tool.\nIntrusion Prevention System (IPS) to block known attack tools and the low and slow attacks.\nSSL protection to protect against encrypted flood attacks.\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent web application vulnerability exploitations.\n\n\nThe Human Factor\nWhen you climb a mountain you have to do a clear and solid risk assessment before you start. What are the weather conditions?  Am I in good enough shape for this climb?  Am I protected enough?\nThese questions tie to human factors that should be considered in mountain climbing and in IT Security – the tendency to underestimate risk and overestimate personal skills and capabilities.\nUnderestimating Risk\nWhen you go climbing conditions can change rapidly, so underestimating risk can be a serious issue and this can leave you unprepared. For DDoS attacks, there is similar notion I still see with many IT managers and business owners – the assumption that attacks will not happen to them. But what I know and see in everyday business, is that it is not a question of IF a company will become a victim of a cyber-attack, but a question of WHEN.\nIn the 2015 Application and Network Security Report, there’s evidence that cyber-threats are growing and expanding to new targets. The technical “bag of tricks” is bigger than ever and even organizations with by-the-book security programs can be caught off guard.\nOverestimating Capability\nHave a look at the picture below.  What do you think will be required to ride down this slope?\nMore than what you may think.  Beyond above average skills, a rider would need specialized equipment, transportation and a partner for safety.\nAnother detrimental requirement is that the climber clearly understands their own capabilities and skills.  If they don’t, climbers can risk their health or life and could also put their team into a dangerous situation because they take care and cover you.\n\nIf you’re ever able to make such a ride, it will be a “once in a lifetime” experience you will never forget!\nAn average skier or snowboarder will have difficulties on a trail like this and an average network manager will likely have difficulty fighting off a DDoS attack.\nOften the skill set from a sophisticated cyber-attacker may outreach the knowledge and experience of a regular IT team. Does your team have the skills required? What would happen if they lose this battle? How crucial is your infrastructure and what is the maximum damage you can accept?\nIt is crucial to pick the right partner and the best team to fight against today’s cyber-attacks. An educated, skillful team will make sure your services and applications are protected and stay online, all the time.\n\nThe Radware ERT\nTherefore it is crucial to pick the right partner and the best team which is educated and has the required skill set to fight against todays cyber-attacks. This will make sure your services and application will be protected and stay online, all the time.\nThere are many more commonalities between those two fields, but honestly, to touch all of them would end up in a small book and not blast this blog. I am happy to discuss both areas when we meet next time at one of our shows or as part of a personal meeting.\nAs this is my final blog for 2015, I wish all our Radware customers, partners and of course all I know personally a successful 2016 and hope you will reach your personal and security mountain.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/12/climbing-security-mountain-2016/');

The cost of these attacks is also staggering. According to the “2013 Cost of Data Center Outages” from Ponemon Institute, cyber-attacks can cost an average of $822,000 per incident.\n\nDenial of Service (DoS) attacks are commonly used to saturate the infrastructure (network routers, firewalls and application servers) with a large number malicious requests in an effort to leave the application unresponsive to legitimate traffic. The best line of defense against these threats is a good perimeter security to protect network and application resources. The edge protection device or service can divert malicious traffic to a Scrubbing Center (SC) or service. The SC will cleanse and forward only the legitimate traffic back to the customer network, thus eliminating the denial of service threat from the customer network.\n\nDefense Messaging (also called Signaling) is a technique used to enhance on-premise data center security detection and mitigation solutions with cloud-based scrubbing. Defense Messaging can accelerate the response time required to mitigate a denial of service attack. Increasingly, application traffic is encrypted, so sophisticated DoS attacks may also encrypt their attacks with SSL/TLS to degrade application response. The intent here is to starve resources from valid user requests. In such situations, web application firewalls and application delivery controllers may use defense messaging to quickly signal to perimeter security devices or external scrubbing services to stay protected against encrypted denial of service attacks.\nDefense Messaging is an efficient, responsive and cost-effective way for organizations to respond to sophisticated encrypted attacks directed at network, security and application infrastructure.

The use of technology being for good or for evil in reality has as much to do with the perspective of the user than anything else.\n\nThe same is true in the information security space, where there is a litany of examples tied to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks leveraging various elements of network infrastructure to be turned into a “weapon” of sorts. Many are beginning to discuss the potential of the billions of devices expected to come online as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) movement to be turned into a mega-bot of sorts to launch similar attacks.\nWhen Good Technology Turns Bad\nIn the DDoS realm there is another major, and more immediately relevant, example of good technology turned bad…  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or encrypted attacks.  If you’re reading this you almost certainly understand the history of SSL, the standard for securing communications to drive increased trust for online interactions.  Increasingly, however, SSL is being used to mask and further complicate attack traffic detection in both network and application level threats.\n\nAccording to Radware’s 2015 Global Network and Application Security Report, as much as 25% of attack activity today is using SSL-based attack vectors.\nThe Challenge of SSL Attacks\nSSL attacks are particularly virulent for a few reasons. First, they significantly complicate the process of identifying attacks and differentiating them from legitimate, encrypted traffic. Secondly, the actual mitigation of SSL attacks (when they can be identified) requires significantly more computational power for processing encrypted traffic.  This is why most technology solutions struggle significantly to manage this type of attack.  Many cannot handle the challenges of detection and even fewer are engineered to manage the exponential demands of SSL attack mitigation and processing, without the battle having an impact on their overall performance.\nFinally, many require a compromise of some kind with regard to SSL certificate management in order to comply with the demands of processing encrypted traffic. For instance, if a user has to adjust security protections every time an application certificate is modified, this quickly becomes an unmanageable requirement for most security teams.\nThere has been a push by Internet users, privacy advocates, and technology providers alike to stimulate broad SSL end user adoptions.  According to Internet security researcher Netcraft, the use of SSL by the top one million websites has increased by 48% over the past two years.  Other initiatives, such as the “Let’s Encrypt” project is launching a new, free certificate authority in an effort to move more users over to encrypted online communication and commerce.\nWhat Can You Do?\nAt Radware, we see SSL attacks as one of our industry’s most significant challenges going forward, given the complexity of the vector and the dramatic rise in the general use of encryption. If you’d like to learn more about the subject, we recently completed an eBook on the subject of SSL attacks, including providing specifics on various types of SSL attacks, as well as strategies for effective protection.\n\nDownload the “SSL Attacks on the Rise: Protective Technology Turned Attack Vector” eBook.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Encryption\', \'network security\', \'SSL\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/12/ssl-breaks-bad/');

You may be familiar with many of the data breaches that were covered in the media this year, including the United States IRS, several major health care providers, Ashley Madison, and most recently, the personal data of children and parents from the vTech breach. Just last week, retailer Target agreed to settle with several banks for $39 million over their 2013 data breach.\n\nSmoke screen attacks are an interesting technique that is common in data exfiltration. As the name suggests, these are attacks on the network that are specifically designed to misdirect security personnel from the real threat, which is data exfiltration. By distracting a security team, attackers are hoping they can slip under the protection sets by overloading them with activity in other parts of the network.\nHow it Works\n Security personnel typically monitor the network using tools that generate alerts when there is an anomaly. When configured to do so, things like changes in bandwidth usage, latency, availability, and responsiveness will all send alerts to the Network/Security Operations Center (NOC or SOC). It’s that team’s job to begin investigating those events and one of the first places to look are event logs. It is best practice to have network appliances like routers, firewalls, and IPSs send their logs to a central collector, which allows for better correlation between network events, so tools like this make sense as the first place to look.\nThat is exactly what smoke screen attackers are hoping for. By attacking a network on multiple fronts, the attacker hopes to create confusion and misdirection. Knowing that security personnel will check the traditional tools, attackers will attempt to overwhelm them with irrelevant traffic, slowing down unrelated applications or filling logs with irrelevant data. Doing so makes identifying unique events more difficult.\nWhat Can You Do?\nIf you notice an attack, you must be mindful of the intent. Was it designed to disrupt your network but your infrastructure handled it? Was it a decoy? Check your logs and perhaps filter out vectors once you’ve ruled them out. Check your other assets or collaborate with other departments in your organization to ensure that nothing else looks wrong.\nThe best way to assess and mitigate a smoke screen attack is with the use of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can help prevent data theft and the manipulation of sensitive corporate data, as well as protecting customer information. By combining this with an on premise detection and behavioral analysis device, you can mitigate smoke screen attacks while protecting customer data at the same time.\nIt is absolutely critical that organizations protect consumer data. Security professionals need to leverage all of the tools available to protect the integrity of this data. At Radware, we feel that layered security is the best way to do this. Web Application Firewalls can protect your websites and databases. DDoS mitigation appliances can protect you from the smoke screens. Firewalls and a strong perimeter can secure access. Make use of the tools and forensic data that you have available. And finally, remember that things aren’t always what they seem and a smoke screen attack just might be real intent of obvious network events.\nCyber-attacks are complex and dynamic challenges for anyone responsible for cyber security. \n\nDownload the DDoS Handbook for things to consider when planning for attacks.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'data breach\', \'information security\', \'network security\', \'Smokescreen Attacks\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/12/how-smoke-screen-cyber-attacks-are-being-used/');

Â Why is this a problem?Â  Well, before I go on a rant letâs be clear that I am an advocate for a multi-layered defense in depth â enable DDOS protections where you can, harden infrastructure ACLs, servers and applications, and yes, even leverage functions on those firewalls, IPS and ADCs.\nDo you even need a firewall in front of your web servers?Â  Take caution.Â  A web applicationÂ firewall, IPS and Application Delivery Controllers are stateful and not purpose built for DDOS mitigation.Â  These devices open connections and maintain session state tables between the client (or attacker) and the server.Â  Inherently, these DDoS security tools themselves are actually one of the most likely bottlenecks while under DDOS attacks due to their stateful nature.\nHere is a look at a real world attack analysis from our Emergency Response Team.Â  Two thirds of the attacks can be prevented by protecting against DDOS in front of the firewall and other stateful devices.\n\nAttacks (such as TCP SYN and UDP floods, application layer attacks on HTTP, DNS, SIP, SMTP, etc.) can take advantage of stateful devices by opening many sessions and eventually exhausting the state tables, preventing further connections from being established or causing device overloads.\nIn production environments, weary security teams often configure IPS to fail open.Â  When overloaded by DDoS attacks, the IPS causes the security protections that once were in place to be pulled back and be open to exploitation.Â  Hackers understand this and will often use attacks to simply tip over the IPS and exploit the target without security inspection.Â  If a security tool itself will fail or cannot withstand todayâs threats, should the vendor be claiming DDoS protection?\nGranted, perhaps itâs not cut and dry.Â  There may be features on a device that can be leveraged in a multi-layered defense, such as signatures for known DoS tools.Â  Some firewalls can also perform functions such as SYN cookie challenge to weed out spoofed TCP SYN packets.Â  Again, Iâm an advocate for multi-layered defense, but the problem is when a buyer believes they are covered from DDoS because their Firewall has a âfunctionâ which can help play a role in the defense.\nLipstick on a Pig\nThe message is simple here: Â beware of stateful devices and clever marketing campaigns.\nStateful devices and DDoS mitigation are a dangerous mix.Â  Vendors may use buzzwords and offer incomplete solutions and buyers are at the mercy of the data that is in front of them.Â  This influx of clever marketing can mislead buyers as vendors flock to this hot market and consumers may find subpar products reaching their production enterprise and carrier network architectures.\n\nThe decision to acquire DDoS mitigation solutions is NOT as straight forward as one would like. Â On the surface many of the products appear to be leveraging similar technologies, methods, and even verbiage.Â  As the DDOS market grows itâs becoming difficult for the inexperienced buyer to differentiate between sound security solutions and clever marketing.Â  Dig into the details and you too will realize that all solutions are not equal.Â  Some vendors claim DDoS protection within existing gear revamped as DDoS mitigation.Â  Have they actually hardened these legacy devices or simply undergone efforts toward marketing ânewâ use cases? Â You can put lipstick on a pig, but itâs still a pig.\nSelecting the Best Premise-Based Solution\nDedicated solutions offering purpose built, tailored hardware is architected with 100% availability and security in mind.Â  Premise-based DDoS mitigation should be deployed as close to the perimeter (Internet transit point) of the network and always in front of stateful devices.Â  Placement in the frontlines of the defense, provide protection of the network infrastructure, stateful firewalls, load balancers/ADCs, IPS, servers AND applications.Â  A proper DDoS mitigation solution should be designed so that it will never become the bottleneck while under attack.\nAn example of this is the Radware DefensePro.Â  The DefensePro itself is not stateful.Â  It filters out attacks prior to the monitoring of legitimate sessions for misbehaving actors while never maintaining session state. Â This allows identification sessions which are out of state (such as FIN or ACK packet floods) without existing sessions in place.Â  This unique approach ensures we monitor the sessions that matter only after attack mitigation occurs.Â  We often find ourselves in situations where a technical evaluation puts us to the test to prove we have the best solution.Â  DefensePro offers superior DDoS prevention with the industryâs best security inspection capabilities up to 160Gbps of legitimate traffic with mitigation capacity rates over 230Mpps in dedicated ASICs.\nValidate: The Proof is in the Pudding\nIâll leave you with some final words of experience:Â  Take your DDoS equipment for a test ride and leverage real-world scenarios with real traffic.Â  Ensure that legitimate users can access your applications even when under attack.Â  Also validate that latency is at a minimum.Â  Severe latency can be as degrading as a complete outage.\nTest, Test and Test Again\nOften DDoS attack test plans focus on volume (bps/pps).Â  But, donât forget about application layer floods including HTTP(s) GET, POST floods, DNS Recursive & Reflective, SIP, SMTP, UDP amplification and protocol attacks such as SSL renegotiation.Â  Encrypted attacks are on the rise with the advent of HTTP 2.0 and the increased need for privacy for many applications will be moving to full TLS encryption.Â  DDoS testing should be included in regular penetration and vulnerability assessments.\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"The âStateâ of DDoS Mitigation Products and Vendors\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/12/ddos-mitigation-products-vendors/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Dennis Usle\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/state-of-ddos.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1080,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2015-12-05\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2015-12-05\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'data breach\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'Firewalls\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/12/ddos-mitigation-products-vendors/');

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (296, 'Why Your Firewall Could Fail During a DDoS Attack', 'Ron Winward', '2015-11-30', 'Can Your Firewall and IPS Block DDoS Attacks?  This question is something we hear often at Radware.  The concern surrounds the uncertainty that stateful devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, and load balancers) could become the fault point in a network when it is under attack.  According to our research of different attacks analyzed over the last year, approximately one third of the failures in attacks were attributed to stateful devices being placed in front of a web-facing resource.  In other words, the devices that we deploy in the datacenter to maintain our uptime are sometimes the specific reason that networks fail when they come under attack.\n\nI recently worked with a customer who was troubleshooting this exact issue.  They purchased good firewalls from a reputable, well known vendor and deployed them in a high-availability (HA) architecture.  The firewalls were configured correctly, hardened, deployed in HA – everything you would expect for a great deployment.  And yet, seemingly every time they got attacked, these expensive firewalls would fall over.  Even under relatively low-volume attacks that didn’t saturate their Internet capacity, these services would fail.\nStatefulness is one reason for this.  Stateful firewalls are specifically tasked with keeping track of open transactions in the network.  Tracking that state requires finite compute resources on the firewall and eventually, when pushed, those resources become consumed.  Individual performance can vary based on many things (CPUs, RAM, security features and policies, even enabling IPv6) but the risk is the same – consuming resources in a stateful device can ultimately make it fail.\nWhat Does the Failure Look Like?\nIn the example above, the most obvious symptom is that the customer couldn’t reach their servers.  But when we looked at the firewalls, we observed other symptoms like instability of device management, VPN disconnects, and even HA failovers.  In the lab, we can capture the real impact of DDoS attacks on firewalls.\nThe Setup\nLet’s dig into this a bit.  I setup a lab to test the impact of a small TCP-SYN flood on a modern firewall.  This particular firewall has two CPU cores; one for control-plane functions like CLI, SSH management, SNMP, etc, and one for security-related functions like session setup, firewalling, IDS, NAT, and VPN.  Having this separation is important because it allows us to see what happens to the security feature set when under attack.\nThe attack was approximately 280 Mbps of TCP-SYN flood from multiple random spoofed sources.  280 Mbps is not a very big attack these days and it might not even be enough traffic to be obvious if you’re looking at your Internet traffic graphs.  Nevertheless, it’s a significant amount of new connections that the firewall has to process.  Here’s what it looks like from the switch facing the firewall WAN port (inbound into the firewall):\n\nThe attack begins at approximately 18:35 and lasts for approximately two hours.  Now let’s look at the impact on the firewall.  This graph shows the CPU utilization during the attack.  The red line is the Control CPU and the green line is the Security CPU:\n\nThe Results\nWhat we can see here is that during this attack, the Security CPU on this firewall was 100% utilized for most of the attack.  Remember, this particular CPU is responsible for all of the security features that the firewall handles.  The impact of this attack would be severe to traffic traversing the firewall, ranging from latency and timeouts to VPN sessions dropping.  At 100% CPU utilization, the firewall is exhausted and can no longer perform its function without impacting service.\nSYN Flood Protection on the Firewall Might Not Help!\nIn this example, enabling SYN flood protection on the firewall does not help because we’ve consumed the CPU with the attack.  SYN flood protections typically drop the packet at the firewall rather than forwarding it through, but the firewall still has to process it against policy and decide what action to take.\nWhat Other Options Exist?\nOne of the first things that people think is “I need a bigger firewall.”  There are big firewalls and it’s true that you can likely push this out by adding resources to the firewall layer (more processing, bigger firewalls, etc.).  However, I’ll suggest that if DDoS protection is a concern, adding more resources to a stateful perimeter is just delaying the problem.  The servers that are being used to generate these attacks are also stronger than ever before.  An exploited server with a 10 Gbps NIC in a datacenter can cause a lot of damage to a stateful device that is being targeted.\nAt Radware, we approach this problem differently.  Our DDoS prevention solution, DefensePro, is not stateful and can assess and mitigate these threats before they consume your firewall or other stateful devices.  By inserting a purpose-built DDoS mitigation device inline before that attack traffic reaches your stateful devices, you can eliminate the threat of connection exhaustion and other risks.\nConclusion\nAs security people, it would be difficult to find anyone to challenge the importance of a firewall.  Firewalls are critical devices in today’s networks.  However, what I think you will find is that people will advise caution as to where the firewall sits and what its purpose is.  For the reasons above, many DDoS security experts will advise against deploying a stateful firewall in front of any web-facing resource that needs to maintain uptime.  Every network is different, but if uptime is important to your network, you should have a plan for handling attacks and you should know the limits of your existing architecture.  It doesn’t take much to impact a stateful device, which is why purpose-built DDoS mitigation devices are becoming a necessary part of today’s network.\n\n\nDownload Radware’s DDoS Handbook to get expert advice, actionable

Before getting too deep into the specifics, letâs reestablish some basic points about hybrid protection.\nItâs essentially a unanimous decision on the part of industry analysts that hybrid protection provides the most complete DDoS solutions for protection from todayâs complex cyber-attacks. Since Radware introduced the hybrid model in 2012, we have seen an endless wave of competitors implement their flavor of hybrid, some more true to the concept than others. We still maintain a significant lead on others in terms of delivering a single-vendor hybrid solution, but thatâs a blog post for another day.\nThe major benefits of hybrid DDoS protection, detailed more fully in our recent eBook, include:\n\nFull, always-on mitigation of ALL attack types; not limited to volumetric and/or whatâs detected by Netflow\nAvoids peace-time latency issues inherent in always-on cloud models\nAvoids collateral damage risks of always-on cloud models\nEliminates burden on the customer for attack detection and traffic redirection\nSpeeds time to mitigate and effectiveness of mitigation when volumetric attacks are swung to the cloud\n\nSo, this assumption that hybrid solutions are expensive?\nCertainly, providers of cloud-only solutions have a vested interest in promulgating this misperception. But in my experience it generally boils down to a lack of research on the part of the buyer. Obviously, the price point for various on premise products is going to vary significantly. Thatâs not only true when youâre talking vendor-to-vendor, but also model-to-model. Some on premise devices are made to handle extremely high traffic throughput and attack mitigation throughput, and are built largely for large network operators, carriers, etc. However, if youâre working with a provider that offers a wide range of on premise options and flexibility in terms of licensing for clean traffic models or attack models, a very reasonably priced on premise device that can deliver the above benefits is within reach for most.\nAnother concern often heard from prospects looking at different options is the management of the on premise component of the hybrid DDoS solution. A terrible misconception Iâve run into (including from some analysts) is that managing any on premise device requires someone on the security or network operations team to keep up with the highly dynamic and constantly evolving attack landscape. Again, the level of manual intervention required for effective protection from on premise devices varies from vendor-to-vendor. At Radware, we strongly encourage prospects to look deeply at the automation capabilities of the solutions they explore so they can see this wide variance first hand. It is an accurate statement by analysts that most operations teams will struggle to maintain the more manual solutions on the market. But the automation capabilities of many, such as Radwareâs Real-Time Signature technology that provides automated protection from zero-day attacks, largely remove the management responsibilities for these devices.\nAnd finally, for an increasing number of customers the best option is to go with a fully managed service to manage the on premise along with cloud-based elements of the hybrid solution. A growing number of vendors are introducing a fully managed service options around their DDoS solutions. Obviously, the cloud-based component is going to be a managed service. But the management of the on premise device is also an option, often at a price much more effective that putting a percentage of someoneâs time against the management. When exploring the managed services options out there, prospects should carefully consider the depth of security and DDoS threat management experience held by the team doing the device management.\n\nDownload the “Cloud vs. On-Premise Security: Striking a Balance For Optimal Protection” E-Book\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"BlogPosting\",\n    \"headline\": \"The âMisconceptions about Hybrid DDoS Protection: Itâs Costly and Complicated.\",\n    \"mainEntityOfPage\": {\n        \"@type\": \"WebPage\",\n        \"@id\": \"https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/misconceptions-about-hybrid-ddos-protection/\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"Ben Desjardins\",\n    \"image\": {\n        \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/costly-ddos-protection.jpg\",\n        \"height\": 1277,\n        \"width\": 1920\n    },\n    \"datePublished\": \"2015-11-19\",\n    \"dateModified\": \"2015-11-19\",\n    \"publisher\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n        \"name\": \"Radware\",\n        \"logo\": {\n            \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n            \"url\": \"https://blog.radware.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog_logo_schema.png\",\n            \"height\": 60,\n            \"width\": 155\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud Security\', \'ddos\', \'Hybrid Security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/misconceptions-about-hybrid-ddos-protection/');

We started to outline the key requirements for a DDoS vendor and now I’d like to continue this point.\n\nHow Can An Organization Protect All Enterprise Assets—No Matter Where They Reside?\nIn many organizations, data centers operate in multiple locations while a growing portion of the infrastructure lives in the cloud. Dispersing the IT infrastructure introduces as many challenges as benefits. With the safe borders of the perimeter no longer protecting all enterprise assets, existing security measures need to be re-evaluated.\n\nWhile enterprise security is evolving, so are cybercriminals and attacks. It has become common knowledge that there is no way to prevent attacks – but there is a very strong need to mitigate them. If an organization’s DDoS security strategy does not take that into consideration, the organization and its users are at risk.\nWhat is the key factor for a successful security strategy?  One that truly benefits from all the advantages of the advanced detection and DDoS mitigation solutions deployed in the organization?  The answer seems to be a shift from location to communication.  As the locations of detection and mitigation tools continually increase, the need for a coordinating mechanism – both human and machine based – grows, as well.\nDistributing the detection and mitigation layers across all enterprise application infrastructures can deliver a global view of network behavior and the attack states. Information collected from all detection tools needs to be correlated and analyzed to determine which mitigation process to use.\nNow, what are the key criteria for detection and mitigation when evaluating a vendor for DDoS and cyber-attack protection?\nAssess each vendor for these criteria – aiming to maximize capabilities in each area:\nHow Good Is The Vendor At DETECTION?\nQuality\nThis section evaluates the ability for the vendor to provide high-quality detection:\n\nType(s) of Detection Available\n\nNetflow\nPacket L7 Headerless\nOpenflow\nCoverage of OWASP Vulnerabilities\nPacket L3/4\nInputs/Signals from Other Mitigation Tools\nPacket L7 Header Required\nDeployment Model Options\nIn-Line\nCloud Scrubbing Center – Asynschronous\nOOP – Synchronous\nSoftware Defined Networking (SDN)\nHybrid Cloud Options\nVirtual Deployment Options\nInternal Scrubbing Center – Asynschronous\nFeeds from Partners/Works with Other Vendor Signals\n\nTime\nThis section evaluates the categories required for modern attack detection:\n\nReal-Time Options\nSignaling/Automatic Options (for Advanced Application Attacks)\nSignaling/Automatic Options (for Cloud Diversion)\n\nReporting & Response\nThis section evaluates the categories required for controlling and reporting modern attack detection:\n\nReal-Time\nDetection Support Response – Real Time\nHistorical\nDetection Support Response – On-Site Options\nForensics\nIntegrated Reporting with Cloud Portal\nIntelligence Reporting\nAbility to Discern Legitimate vs. (that is, can detect before an attack) Illegitimate Traffic in Real-Time\n\nHow Good Is The Vendor At MITIGATION?\nQuality\nDoes the vendor over-mitigate or under-mitigate the threats?

Our area has gone through phases of development over the past 15-20 years that I’ve lived in there, starting with an explosion of residential development (which we can thank in large part for our notoriously bad traffic). But more recently I’ve noticed a shift in the development and construction within the region. Rarely does a week pass now where I don’t notice a new area being cleared for significant construction. I have a friend in commercial real estate and any time I ask him if he knows what’s going into the most recently cleared space, the answer inevitably is “a data center.”\nThe explosion of data center development in this area makes very real and tangible the dramatic growth being experienced by the cloud services and hosting industry, as they increasingly represent a high percentage of incoming tenants.  According to 451 Research, the cloud services space is projected to grow another 36% over the next year, finishing 2016 just shy of $20 billion.\n\nThese boom times for the Cloud Service Provider do come at a price, however. Increasingly, these providers are becoming targets for the kinds of cyber-security threats that previously honed in primarily on enterprises and the largest of carriers or network providers. DDoS attacks, zero-day attacks and malware, and advanced application attacks are just a few of the threats creating new levels of risk for cloud providers.\nTo successfully protect their own infrastructures and the customers they support, cloud service providers are looking to highly scalable security solutions that can be deployed flexibly to leverage data and visibility from across large, often shared networks.\nOne such provider that has proven a commitment to staying ahead of the threat curve and protecting customers is OnlineTech out of Ann Arbor, Michigan. After seeing the growth in cyber-attacks against its own infrastructure, OnlineTech knew it needed a more scalable, forward-looking strategy for protection. Plus, with the reality that today companies from any vertical represent cyber threat targets, they knew every new customer represented both increased risk and potential victims of collateral damage from attacks on other customers.\nOnline Tech wanted to provide an even higher level of security throughout its entire network. The company, like most others, experienced an increase of volumetric attacks. Although these attacks were being blocked, Online Tech did not want its network performance to be affected.\nAccording to Nick Lumsden, Director of Infrastructure at OnlineTech, “historically, we would see one volumetric attack per year. We now see more than four times the amount as well as many low and slow attacks.”\nEarlier this summer, OnlineTech deployed Radware’s Attack Mitigation System to provide a centralized attack management, monitoring and reporting solution including real-time identification, prioritization and response to these attacks.  The timing of their decision to explore and deploy cyber-attack protection proved critical. Since deployment of Radware’s Attack Mitigation System, OnlineTech has been able to successfully defend itself and its customers from a nearly constant stream of attacks.\nOur recently published case study about OnlineTech highlights the details of the situation and solution they put in place, and may act as a good guide for other Cloud Service Providers looking to proactively protect customers.\nAdditionally, our new solution architecture paper provides some additional details about some of the common technical deployments proving successful for providers. It also highlights how Radware’s Attack Mitigation Architecture is specifically designed to meet the demands of large cloud service providers, including a multi-tiered architecture for visibility, automated attack detection and mitigation, and multi-tenant support.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud Security\', \'data centers\', \'network security\', \'Service Providers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/onlinetech-ahead-of-cyber-threat/');

What may come as a surprise is that for some service providers in the space, this perspective causes more concern than glee. Sure, it is fair to say it’s not all bad to encounter prospects with this level of urgency. But the reality is that statements like this are a sign pointing to a long educational process for the buyer more so than a quick sale and long-term happy customer.\n\nThe education process these buyers require has to do with the reality that very large (>50Gbps) DDoS attacks, while headline grabbers, represent a tiny portion of the overall attack landscape. The even more sobering bit of learning for these folks is that the smaller attacks are often just as, if not even more, harmful.\nUnfortunately, the education process faces an uphill battle against a seemingly endless array of news and reports perpetuating an over-emphasis on defending against only the mega attacks. For those already educated on the reality of attacks, a fact not lost is that much of this information comes specifically from vendors with a vested interest in distracting buyers from the scope (or lack) of attack vectors they can effectively detect and then mitigate.\nWhat’s in Your Detection Engine?\nBuyers of DDoS protection services can be forgiven for what might be a less than stringent evaluation process at times. DDoS attacks are increasingly complex across a number of factors… vectors, motives, sources, successful defenses, to name just a few. Thorough testing of potential technologies to detect and mitigate attacks requires vigilance, time and resources. Keeping up with the nature of attacks in a way that empowers buyers to explore options with deep knowledge further challenges the process. Add to that the fact that often (too often, in my opinion) the whole process takes place under some level of duress (already under attack, received a threat, peers being targeted, etc.) and the potential for large leaps of faith on the part of buyers jumps.\nBottom line… buyers who are serious about protecting their organizations need to at a minimum ask detailed questions of vendors about the attack coverage being offered.\nCan you Detect Non-HTTP Vectors?\n\nA growing number of organizations think they’ve already got the DDoS protection they need because they opted to “bundle” DDoS protection in with CDN or other traffic optimization services. The common (but flawed) logic here is a buyer thinking “well, my CDN has a ton of bandwidth and is already managing all of my traffic.” While there is a myriad of reasons why CDNs often struggle to provide even HTTP vector protection, there is an even more basic flaw in this logic… less than one quarter (23%) of attacks leverage HTTP/HTTPS vectors. CDN-based protections can leave the customer exposed to the growing threat of SMTP, FTP or other network protocols in traffic not touched by the CDN.\nCan you Detect SSL Floods Without Affecting Legitimate Traffic?\nAs much as 25-30% of today’s DDoS attacks use SSL to further mask the attack and extend the amount of computing power required to provide protection. Many solutions cannot effectively differentiate encrypted attack traffic from encrypted legitimate traffic and can only rate limit these requests (effectively completing the attack). Additionally, many solutions require the customer to share actual server certificates, which complicates implementation, certificate management and forces customers to share private keys for protection in the cloud.\nCan you Correlate Across DDoS and Non-DDoS Threats?\nIt is increasingly common that DDoS attacks occur as part of a combined multi-vector threat that also includes non-DoS tactics, such as application logic attacks targeting assets at Layer 7. These attacks use the distraction caused by large volumetric attacks as a virtual smoke screen that lowers the likelihood of detection for application attacks (SQL injection, XXS, etc.). Very few technologies can support an advanced implementation that detects these attacks and then coordinates blocking the traffic at the perimeter in conjunction with DDoS attack blocking. As cross vector coordination increases, this capability will further separate those with holistic attack protection from those with a point solution for one vector.\nUnderstand the Full Set of Vectors\nToday, more than 50% of the attacks Radware sees utilize 5 or more vectors. This means unless you want a 50% solution, you MUST take the time to understand the multi-vector challenge and the questions to ask service providers. Here are a couple of educational resources that can help you in this pursuit:\n\nRadware’s 2014-15 Global Network and Application Security Report: this report provides a two-pronged view at the current threat landscape. One set of perspectives comes from the network and application security community through an in-depth survey covering current cyber-security threats and initiatives. The second view comes from Radware’s Emergency Response Team, which provides insights based on first-hand experience protecting customers.\nRadware’s DDoS Handbook: updated annually, the handbook provides a deep history behind DDoS attacks, as well as a comprehensive description of the many types of attacks, approaches to protection, and a checklist for evaluating different solutions.\nCloud vs. On-Premise Security E-Book: This book offers tips on how to strike a balance for optimal protection.  Learn about the common risks of cloud-only solutions, the most effective architectures for trending threat vectors, and what benefits you can gain from hybrid attack detection.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Cloud Security\', \'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'information security\', ', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/myth-larger-attacks-more-damage/');

Theyâve evolved into highly efficient tools which automate nearly everything an attacker might want to accomplish, from escalating privileged access, to decrypting traffic, to driving volume in DDoS attacks.\nMost of the major security threats such as application DDoS, brute force, and SQL injection are executed at least in part through botnets. These tools are designed to select actions based upon the anticipated responses from youâ the defender.Â Â  As people have become more and more predictable in detection and mitigation, the bad guys are designing tools to adjust to our defenses faster than we can detect their changes.\n\nHumans are the Best Attack Vector â And in Ways you Havenât Thought About!\nFrom socially-engineered attacks like Phishing to USB drive attacks, humans have distinguished themselves as being highly vulnerable creatures and not easily secured.\nAutomation addresses two human behavior security issues.\nSecurity Bots would dramatically improve Identity and Access Management (IAM):Â  Letâs face it – no humans, no need for human-esque passwords. In addition, scores of security technologies (and security teams by extension) continue to rely on the IP address, as a primary means of identifying legitimate users and blocking malicious traffic sources. Security professionals need new, more accurate technologies that are not prone to error caused by the myriad of ways an IP address can be spoofed or obfuscated.\nSecurity bots can deprecate or remove much of the humanâs training, performance unpredictability and reliability:Â Â  The sobering truth is that to err is human and there is no patch or process which will solve this problem no matter how much training or effort.Â  Intelligent and predictable âbotsâ or AI are solutions are being deployed in highly successful environments which both give us hope and have dramatic implications for the future of information security.Â  Replacing humans is already occurring in high risk âhumanâ industries such as trading exchanges and transportation.\nLights-Out Security:Â  Help me Security bots!Â  You are our only hope!\nThe truth is that the future of information security will look dramatically different.Â Â  We make a case here that nearly every facet of security will eventually remove humans, from penetration testing and vulnerability testing to Security Operations Center (SOC) operations to incident response.Â  The role of humans will focus on the architecture, design, and automation of security, not in the actual testing or operational management of security.\nNew automated paradigms are being spawned and aided by newer technologies which enable automation and orchestration such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Feature Virtualization (NFV), Cloud Services, Application Program Interface (APIs), and of course, algorithms with intelligence.\nIn addition to process changes, there will also need to be huge overhauls in technology and attention to four major areas of security changing the paradigm from âdefense in-depthâ to defense in what we call Attack Mitigation Pillars: Â Collection, Detection, Command and Control and Mitigation.\nIn the end, there is a lot of good news for security, including the variety of new tools like device fingerprinting that employs methodologies to gather IP-agnostic information about a source.Â  The device fingerprint uniquely identifies a web tool entity by combining dozens of attributes of a userâs device to identify and then track their activities, generating a behavioral and reputational profile of the user.Â  In addition, there are powerful cross-vendor automation and orchestration tools which are dramatically assisting the security professional in automating their collection and mitigation.\nThe growth in algorithms and the adoption of these new powerful toolsets will be the difference between the future successful and secure company, as opposed to companies like Ashley Madison that clearly define the way of the past.Â  However, if we donât see the need to remove people from security operations, testing and auditing and install instead lights-out security centers we will not be able to handle the future AI-driven attack landscape.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Bots\', \'cybersecurity\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/secureworld-2015/');

It accepts the connections for an application by hosting an  IP address that is advertised to the network community.Â  Once the load balancer receives a request to  connect to the application, it decides which actual server to send the request  to from a pool of available servers and re-addresses the original request to that  actual server.Â  The server load balancer  will now act as a middleman, monitoring and proxying the data for the entire  connection as long as it is active.\n \nProxy this!\nIn technical terms, the SLB is a reverse-proxy hosting a virtual IP address (VIP) and doing destination network address translation (NAT) from the VIP to the real server’s IP address.Â  For the life of the connection, the SLB will  maintain a session table entry and continue to map that specific connection to  the real server to maintain that session persistence.\n With SLB technologies, it is now possible to scale a single  application beyond the performance capabilities of a single server easily and  efficiently.Â  An SLB instance can host a  single VIP that is responsible for dozens of real servers.\nClient-side, server-side\nAs SLB technologies evolved, three core sets of  functionality were enhanced.Â  First, the  load balancer needed a way to monitor the status of the real servers it was  sending connections to.Â  Initially, there  were simple health checks such as an ICMP ping to see if the server was  responding on the network, or a simple HTTP GET / request to ensure that the  application was responding.Â  Today, the  health checks can monitor the server resources through advanced scripts and queries  to the server and application.Â  Other  metrics can be used such as the response time of the application or the  capacity of the server relative to the capacity of the other servers in the  pool.\n If a server fails the periodic health checks, the load balancer  can stop sending connections to the server.Â   When the server becomes available, the health checks will succeed again,  and the load balancer will start sending clients to the newly available server.Â  This means that failures will not disrupt the  application availability.Â  This also  means that if more servers are needed to scale the application, they can be  easily be added without any noticeable impact to the clients.\n Second, the load balancer started becoming more intelligent  in the way it recognized connection requests and distributed those connections  to the real servers.Â  Since the load  balancer is proxying the connection, there is the opportunity to inspect the  request to determine if there were special handling procedures necessary.Â  The load balancer can have different  sub-pools of servers for an application based on the type of content.Â  Static content requests can go to a different  sub-pool versus dynamic, scripted content.Â   Different HTTP user-agents can be directed towards different servers.Â  The servers can become more specialized and it  is possible to fine tune the server design based on its functions.\n Last, since the load balancer is acting as a proxy and can  inspect and manipulate the content, it can transparently enhance the delivery  of the content.Â  Technologies such as  HTTP multiplexing to reuse TCP connections, TCP optimization, inline  compression, and SSL termination offloading are all functions that the load  balancer has incorporated to improve the delivery of the application content to  the consumer.\n Today, load balancers have evolved to become application delivery  controllers (ADC) that do much more than standard load balancing leveraging  the fact that they are proxying the application connection.Â  Application-centric functions like web  application firewall (WAF) and single sign on (SSO) have become part of the ADC  portfolio.Â  \nThe van der Waals force of the IT cloud\nUltimately, all of these technologies and features are designed  to ensure that within a datacenter, an application is available and  scalable.Â  For high availability  scenarios, pairs of load balancers can be configured in an active-standby or  active-active model to ensure that no individual point of failure disrupts  access to the application. The capabilities of the load balancer create the  core functions that modern clouds need to properly work.Â  To achieve the agility and elasticity that we  expect in today’s cloud architectures, we need to remember that the SLB  technologies we were using before the evolution of today’s cloud are still a  key part of the standard cloud architectures.Â  \nNext: The History of the Cloud, Part 2 â Global Server Load Balancing\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'Cloud\', \'load-balancer\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2015/11/history-of-the-cloud-pt1/');

Multiple DDoS hits can result in network breaches that can lead into additional damage like the loss or theft of sensitive data.Â  Therefore, when you have plans to invest in a solution to protect you from cyber-attacks, you need to thoroughly assess options in the market to avoid costly mistakes.\nTo find the right solution for your requirements and needs and to get the right protection there are many questions you may ask:\nWill this be the right solution? Will it be able to protect all of your assets in the case of multi-vector and continuous attacks?Â  Will attacks on the application layer or SSL-based attacks be covered? How private is your data when it runs through the data center of a service provider should they be compromised?\n\nThereâs a lot to consider.\nAfter considering all of this, evaluate how and if you are covering the cyber-attack threats facing your unique environment.Â  This checklist can help you find out and identify the different types of DDoS attacks, threats, targets and techniques.\nChoosing the Right Vendor and Solution For You\nVendor Reputation\nIt is crucial to verify a vendorâs experience and reputation. Is their technology market proven? Who are their clients and do they have MSSP clients? Have their clients made headlines for being attacked? In addition, I also highly recommend that you evaluate a single vendor that is able to provide comprehensive attack detection AND mitigation.\nAttack Coverage\nEmerging threats bring with them new attack vectors. It is important to make sure that known attack vectors are mitigated by the offered solution and that protection against SSL encryption attacks and various web-stealth attacks are also included. Be certain to verify that the solution is a hybrid one in order to effectively handle pipe saturation risks with no disturbance to your usersâ experience. Ensure the solution provides layered protection that covers attacks against the network, servers and applications.\nReal-Time and Post-Attack Analysis\nVisibility is critical in layered security architecture. Having a Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) integrated as part of a DDoS protection solution is extremely important. The fact that the IT staff can have full visibility and receive information in real-time, from all detection tools protecting the enterprise assets is crucial.Â  Advanced anti-DDoS solutions must be well integrated with SIEM systems that are able to aggregate, normalize, and correlate data from multiple sources. Real-time information, reports, automated analysis and processes provide visibility and insight during attacks and for post-attack analysis and forensics.\nSupport When Under Attack\nVerify in advance the vendor assistance that is available when you are under attack. There are vendors that offer a team of experts to support clients. Be sure this assistance lasts throughout the whole attack campaign and the team provides post-attack analysis. Some vendors keep a team of researches that provide periodical updates on the market and the new threats.\n\nClick Here to Download the New DDoS Handbook – The Ultimate Guide to Everything You Need to Know About DDoS Attacks\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/11/can-low-cost-ddos-protection-keep-you-safe/');

So, if you find yourself getting lost by my explanation or if youâd like more detail you can see their whole DerbyCon talk on YouTube.\nThe material covered was fairly specific to one exploit chain, but in my mind, I boiled down the material to be a bit more generic. In order for websites using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to function, they have to trust the CDN and include them in their same origin policy. So, if executable content is being cached by the CDN (flash, applet, etc.) it might be possible to inject code and get the CDN to retrieve content from the origin site on behalf of the attacker. This is both a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack and violates the same origin policy. In essence, an attacker can use your CDN against you!\nMike and Matthew gave a specific example of a flash-based web video player called FlowPlayer. The FlowPlayer team created their own URL parser as part of the player. This sounds easy on the surface, but the rules of parsing URLs are actually more complex than you’d think. Because there were bugs in the URL parser, they found several ways to include arbitrary code. The code is retrieved from another site of their choosing, but looks like itâs coming from the destination domain. As it turns out, FlowPlayer has no plans to fix this issue since Flash is going away (by popular demand) in favor of technologies like HTML5. So, sites that continue to use the flash-based FlowPlayer will continue to be vulnerable.\nWhen looking for websites where the vulnerable FlowPlayer versions were used they found an older part of a major providerâs CDN that had multiple versions cached. The way this CDN works, URLs for objects converted so that requests can directly address specific objects on the CDN. The first part of the resource locator might be something like xyz.legitbank.com so it appears that the request is to an object at legitbank.com, but DNS sends the request to the xyz host on the CDN instead.\nIn the exploit chain example they gave:\n\nA user logs into Legitbank to do their banking and creates an authenticated session. Even if the browser tab is closed the session is still active from the server perspective (unless the user actually logged out!).\nThe next step might be kind of hard, because the user has to be directed to the attackerâs website somehow. This step would probably rely on spear phishing, search engine optimization, or social media to direct traffic to them.\nThe attacker site calls the resource locator for the Legitbank hosted application (in this case FlowPlayer). That application is then retrieved from the CDN and run in the Legitbank.com domain origin space.\nThe attacker injects external code into the application so it can make requests to Legitbank.com without violating the same origin policy. That means it can use the session that was established by the user.\nRaid bank account. Profit.\n\nTo prevent this type of attack one has to make sure that the same origin policy on the origin server is as specific and wildcard free as possible. Limiting the types of content cached by the CDN and performing security audits, code review, and perhaps pentesting on any executable content that can be cached is now important too!\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'CDN\', \'Cyber attacks\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/whats-lurking-in-your-cdn/');

I took a seat at the bar, and the  bartender pointed out the tablet waiting for me from which I could view the  menu and order my lunch. \nSo this is what we’ve come to… an obsession with  digitizing every interaction to the point where I use an app to communicate to  the person five feet in front of me? While perhaps a somewhat extreme and silly  (though 100% true) example, we are clearly on a path of living and interacting  increasingly through apps.\n\n There’s lots of data to support this by the way…\n This past summer, Nielsen published  the results of a survey on smartphone and mobile application usage. In  addition to the unsurprising result that consumers spend more time than ever on  their devices (about 37 hours per month), the study revealed that the average  number uses on average over 20 different applications per month. \n Growing even faster than the use of apps on mobile devices is  the number of options consumers have when it comes to apps. Both the iOS App  Store and Google Play have nearly  doubled the number of apps that they offer between 2013 and 2014, with  Google passing Apple for the first time last year.Â  I struggle to think of a major retailer or  consumer brand that isn’t pushing me towards some application to replace  archaic forms of interaction such as a phone call or (heaven forbid) a  face-to-face interaction. And these apps are now more than just a means of  lowering costs associated with customer support. Look at the current ad  campaign by GEICO promoting their consecutive awards for “best mobile app” as  the basis for why I should pick them for insurance (everyone knows that). \n The seemingly unstoppable momentum behind consumer apps got  us thinking… how do these consumers feel about the security of the  applications they use day-in, day-out? With this general question in mind, we commissioned  Harris Poll to conduct an online survey of our own among U.S. consumers1,  and today  published the results.  I encourage you to access  the full report and  supporting infographic,  but will give you a few highlights of what we learned.\nSecurity Concerns?  Yeah, sort of…\n  A prevailing mindset of consumers when it comes to the  security of applications they use seems to be that they have concerns, but not  enough to stop them from downloading and using them. Fully, 87% say that they  expect cloud-based applications could be hacked. Still, a puzzling  contradiction appears where 45% say they believe the apps generally keep personal  data secure. Sort of “well it could happen… but I don’t think it will… at least not to me.”\n  Consumers worry that the most popular applications would be more  likely to be targeted than less popular ones, with 69% agreeing these are the  most likely to be hacked. The previously mentioned Nielsen study also indicates  that over 70% of app usage is driven by the top 200 apps. This raises an  interesting question for me… do the most popular apps represent the  greatest risk to consumers with regard to data loss? I think it is totally  reasonable to assume that the most popular apps are also the most popular  targets, in much the same way that the most popular operating systems or  software become common targets for vulnerability exploit. But it’s also fair to  assume that the top 200 applications have been built and are operating with a  level of security in mind above that of the other 5 million or so apps out  there. \n Or maybe I’m the one with faulty perceptions and  expectations of application security. Consider the recent issue with the  Kardashian apps (written  about recently by my colleague Carl Herberger by the way), the result of a  vulnerability in an underlying API. \n This points out another key dynamic around the explosion of  consumer apps… more often than not, the organization represented by the  app is not behind the creation of the applications. Still, it is their brand  and their trusted relationships with their customers that are at risk. \n But that’s not all that’s at risk. Our survey reveals that  consumers have significant expectations of organizations that breach their  trust. Specifically, 85% of consumers say that brands behind the app should  offer compensation or identity protection to those affected if there is a  breach. Additionally, over half of those who use cloud-based apps/services (54%)  say they would stop using the app if a breach occurred. Given the propensity  for use of apps, that likely means they may start using a competitor rather  than revert to other ways of interacting.\n The results of our survey reinforce some common responses  when surveying consumers about security, but also give some good insights into  consumer trade-offs for convenience vs. security. And they also should give  organizations considering (or already) leveraging apps to engage with consumers  some perspective on what’s at stake and the expectations around remedying  security issues.\n1Online  survey conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Radware from Sept. 28-30, 2015  among 2,049 U.S. adults age 18 and older, among which 621 use cloud-based  apps/services.

Certainly, a healthy number of companies that come to Radware looking for help are those that have been hit by large attacks. They either had no solution in place or found that the solution they had was ill equipped. Also not uncommon are organizations that have been threatened by attacks through some kind of ransom-based threat. Naturally, these evaluations occur under some urgency and duress, making it challenging on both sides.\n\nWe also frequently meet with companies looking to proactively put DDoS protections in place – often they are responding to the continued headlines around attacks or have caught wind of a peer in their industry becoming a target. Regardless of the background, a proactive stance is a great opportunity to complete a thorough evaluation and proof-of-concept for the customer, working from their own unique requirements.\n\nA typical step in presenting our solution is a demonstration of certain capabilities, usually involving pulling a copy of a portion of their traffic off of a span port and feeding it into our technology. With rare exception, what we find is that there is already attack activity ongoing. So much for proactive protection planning!\nOK, to be fair, these companies are by-and-large leading many of their peers in seeking a holistic solution. The fact that they are unaware of ongoing activity is a testament to the importance of purpose built technologies that specialize in the detection of the rapidly growing array of DDoS attack vectors and tools.\nConsiderations Worth Considering\nThere are a wide array of capabilities and requirements that organizations seeking effective advanced cyber-attack (including DDoS) protection need to consider. And although the weighting or importance of different requirements will vary from company to company, there are some common factors that should be foremost in any solution consideration. Among them, the efficiency and accuracy of attack detection AND minimizing time to effective mitigation when redirecting attacks to cloud-based resources.\nMany security teams struggle to maintain dedicated resources that can keep up with the variety of threats and provide effective manual detection. Sure, it’s easy to tell when you’re getting slammed by a 100+ Gbps attack, but many attacks that don’t exceed link capacity thresholds can exhaust more specific resource constraints within your network or application infrastructure. They are much less obvious to most. Many cloud-only solutions can leave the customer with the burden of detection and having to make a trade-off between low thresholds for mitigation and low false positive rates.\nMany solutions are very specific about the various attack vectors its technology can block, but are less specific about how well it identifies and isolates these attacks from legitimate traffic. Over mitigation becomes a common problem with many solutions that cannot use a full view into normal traffic patterns to detect anomalies that warrant further inspection for potential malicious intent.\nAdditionally, some cloud-based resources will tell you they can implement active attack monitoring through a sample of traffic flows, such as Netflow data. Typically, these solutions are simply detecting traffic patterns that exceed established rates and thresholds, rather than looking deep into the traffic for behavioral patterns that may signal an attack.\nThe Battle Against the Clock\nThis lack of an accurate on-premise cyber-attack detection capability has implications not only on the non-volumetric attacks, but also those large attacks that we read about in the news. Let’s assume for the sake of argument that a company utilizing a cloud-only DDoS solution has the ability to detect large attacks. They still need to initiate a swing of traffic to the scrubbing centers of their provider, and then wait for those cloud-based resources to assess the attack for optimal mitigation tactics.\nOrganizations need to consider a focus on minimizing this ‘time to mitigation’ – the period of time it takes mitigation resources to fully understand the nature of an attack and apply the appropriate defenses. Without proper visibility into the attack prior to receiving the traffic, many cloud-based services can take upwards of 30 minutes to start active mitigation and even longer for application of the right tools for effective protection. Conversely, hybrid solutions that combine the cloud-based resources with on-premise components have the advantage of attack visibility in advance of this traffic redirection.\nAdvanced hybrid solutions go a step further by supporting deep defense messaging between premise and cloud to share a full footprint of the attack and knowledge of already proven mitigation tactics for defense.\nThe Easy Way Out?\nMore often than makes me comfortable, I hear organizations say they are looking hard at cloud-only protection resources because it’s “easier” and they just don’t have the resources to manage the attacks. Hopefully the above examples provide a couple of the flaws in this philosophy . . . cloud-only in the end will often put more not less burden on your teams for ensuring that attacks don’t cause outage. It’s unfortunate that this thinking exists in the marketplace, particularly when the option of fully-managed hybrid solutions exist and can often be less expensive than cloud-only options. The good news is that when they take just a bit of time to fully explore their options, the right choice quickly becomes apparent.\n\n\nDownload our new e-book “Cloud vs. On-Premise Security: Striking a Balance for Optimal Protection” to take a deeper look at the kinds of attacks that cloud-based DDoS solutions typically don’t address and why this can be so damaging to your online operations.\n\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/network-security-can-only-mitigate-what-it-can-detect/');

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (309, 'The Cloud Path â Rerouting Traffic in Peacetime Solves some Cyber-Attack Risk, Creates Others', 'Ben Desjardins', '2015-10-22', 'Last month, I wrote about some inherent challenges with the increasingly popular cloud-only model for cyber-attack mitigation. As a reminder, I am not a cloud hate monger… the cloud is often an acceptable (and sometimes the only) place to mitigate certain attacks. But I do get concerned by the apparent over adjustment to cloud-based solutions, and look here to pick up on the second of four specific shortcomings of cloud-only attack mitigation.\n\nTake the Long Way Home\nIf youâre like me, the paths you take from Point A to Point B can be habit forming. Maybe Iâm risk averse or lack a sense of adventure, but when I find a route that works, I tend to stick with it â sometimes to a fault. When I first moved to my current neighborhood, the main road into and out of town was undergoing construction, forcing most to use a small two lane road. And the realities of road construction being what they are, this work took seemingly twice as long as necessary… a good four months I would say. By the time the work was done, I had become so accustomed to the detour route that I mindlessly kept using it. That is until one afternoon when there was an accident on the road, causing a massive delay that I didnât see coming until I was too far down the path to turn around. Seeing the errors of my ways, I started using the more logical main roads to come and go.\nIâm often reminded of this dreadful drive home when I consider the decision some organizations make in routing all of their Internet traffic through cloud-based security providers even during peacetime. This model, while perhaps providing some sense of relief for its âalways onâ nature, introduces several significant challenges for efficient, reliable service delivery.\nThe Creation of Unnecessary Latency\nThe levels of latency this routing model creates can be hard to predict. This can introduce non-trivial latency into the applicationâs performance even during peacetime.\nMany applications require the minimal latency that comes from full management of the security and application infrastructure. What constitute acceptable levels of latency vary from company to company, but any networking team worth its salt should always be on a lookout for sources of unneeded latency. The impacts of this latency when projected into high throughput services and applications should be considered when determining the transactional processing capacity wasted due to the overall slowdown of traffic.\nHow Redirecting Traffic Affects Redundancy\nOne of the most significant architectural characteristics of the Internet that allowed it to thrive, especially in the early days before notions of high availability and ultra-redundant systems, is its self-healing properties. In an always-on model leveraging cloud-based security resources, all of your traffic must be routed through a finite set of scrubbing centers instead of using the redundancy of native Internet routing since you are forcing all of your traffic to transit 1 or 2 paths.\nTodayâs attacks increasingly include encrypted traffic flows that complicate detection and consume additional computing power to mitigate. About 25% of attacks that Radware mitigates include SSL floods and other forms of encrypted attack. These attacks present a real problem for cloud-only services because unless the customer is willing to provide their private keys to a 3rd party, they will be unable to inspect this traffic and detect an attack. Most pass it right along to the intended target.\nThe work-arounds that have emerged from some cloud security providers are troubling. Particularly dubious to me are the âflexibleâ SSL models that (Iâm sorry but this is how I see it) dupe the user into believing they are in a secure communication between them and a particular third party. In fact, they are in a secure communication with an unknown organization, who is then passing the communication in an unsecure fashion along to its intended recipient.\nBeware the Company You Keep\nAnother challenge surrounding the unnecessary routing of traffic during peacetime is the often overlooked issue of, what can best be called the âcollateral damageâ risk. By forcing the routing of traffic through a set of scrubbing centers, you have introduced a perpetual new point of failure, one that it often difficult to assess in terms of operational performance and maintenance. Additionally, the risk becomes something of a âcompany you keepâ issue, where the reliability of a critical hop for your traffic is now subject to the impact of attacks from an unknown set of other customers supported by the cloud security provider. For providers delivering an always-on option only in the cloud to customers, you quickly can see how a collection of attacks targeting a growing customer base creates a threat against all customers.\nBefore coming to the quick conclusion that sending all of your traffic through a cloud-based security provider is your best option, take the time to consider these downsides of peacetime traffic redirection. Organizations that leverage cloud resources in conjunction with on-premises components incur none of this risk when they are at peacetime, and generally are able to get better detection of attacks that can be mitigated without having to swing traffic. Iâm all for the benefits of the always-on model, but there are better ways to achieve this than an always on swing of traffic.\n\nDownload the New E-Book, Cloud vs. On-Premise Security: Striking a Balance for Optimal Protection\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Cloud Security\', \'latency\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/the-cloud-path/');

A small, but growing trend called permanent denial-of-service (PDOS) attacks can do that for you and this tactic is being used more frequently to sabotage networks and exploit security flaws.\n\nHow Does a PDoS Attack Work?\nA permanent denial-of-service (PDoS) attack, also known loosely as phlashing in some circles, is an attack that damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. By exploiting security flaws or misconfigurations PDoS can destroy the firmware and/or basic functions of system. It is a contrast to its well-known cousin, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which overloads systems with requests meant to saturate resources through unintended usage.\nOne method PDoS accomplish its damage is via remote or physical administration on the management interfaces of the victim’s hardware, such as routers, printers, or other networking hardware. In the case of firmware attacks, the attacker may use vulnerabilities to replace a device’s basic software with a modified, corrupt, or defective firmware imageâa process which when done legitimately is known as flashing. This therefore “bricks” the device, rendering it unusable for its original purpose until it can be repaired or replaced. Other attacks include overloading the battery or power systems.\nWhy Bother with Temporary Outages when you can Achieve Permanent?\nImagine a fast moving bot attack that is not designed for collecting data, but instead, is used to deny a victimâs technology from functioning at all. Think thatâs crazy talk? Well, not really. PDoS has been around for a long time; however, it only shows itself spectacularly to the public from time to time. Letâs explore some examples of this heinous technique.\nIn a recent article published by Help Net Security, they detailed how a new USB exploit can be inserted into a computer and render a computer bricked. In fact, according to Help Net, the latest PDoS USB attack âwhen plugged into a computer â¦ draws power from the device itself. With the help of a voltage converter, the device’s capacitors are charged to 220V, and it releases a negative electric surge into the USB port.â\nAnother example, covered in a 2008 article in Dark Reading additionally highlighted a tool uncovered by HP Labs called PhlashDance. This tool was leveraged to find vulnerabilities in often forgotten firmware and binaries that sit localized on computing devices. The risk lies in the lack of patches and upgrades made to the devices.\nThis article goes on to say that âremotely abusing firmware update mechanisms with a phlashing attack, for instance, is basically a one-shot attack. Phlashing attacks can achieve the goal of disrupting service without ongoing expense to the attacker; once the firmware has been corrupted, no further action is required for the DOS condition to continue.â\nAssessing Risks and Taking Action\nThe following behaviors and trends may increase the risk of a PDoS attack targeting your organization.\n\nRunning a highly virtualized environment that leverages few hardware devices, but powerfully overloads software functions. One PDoS on the platform can create a disaster recovery situation at a minimum. This includes Software Defined Networks (SDNs).\nOrganizations highly dependent on IoT. âThingsâ are highly susceptible to PDoS as they are often simple machines with little to no inherent security measures.\nOrganizations with centralized security gateways. One powerful PDoS can punch a hole in your attack detection and mitigation capabilities.\nOrganizations that are considered critical infrastructure.\n\nThe clear action to take is to conduct an assessment straight away on the type of technology you are running at or below the operating system level. Develop a clear understanding of the different firmware versions, binaries, chip-level software (like ASICs and FPGA) and technology that is in use in your environment. Considerations should also be made for battery, power, and fan system vulnerabilities.\nAssessing the likelihood and risk of a PDoS attack can help you to take the necessary precautions and onboarding controls to protect your most critical assets. Education is an important step in evaluating your risk of PDoS and DDoS Attacks and the DDoS Handbook is an additional resource that can provide expert advice and actionable tools and tips to help detect and stop attacks.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'information security\', \'network security\', \'PDoS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/ddos-fire-forget-pdos-a-permanent-denial-of-service/');

Major Tier 1 telecoms across the globe are already implementing capabilities to reduce costs and add more flexibly to their managed services.\n\nCyber attackers, however, want to exploit the growing attack surface presented by these new open services and legacy security approaches are becoming insufficient in dealing with the new types of attack techniques and targets.  The good news is that when planning and deploying SDN, carriers have a great opportunity now to automate and improve attack detection and mitigation. The key is to implement a network security solution that can take advantage of SDN’s dynamic nature.\nThe SDN Advantage\nAn SDN architecture provides an intelligent central console that decouples the network control plane from the forwarding plane. This enables carriers to meet two critical business objectives:  to create more valuable services by leveraging network-wide intelligence and to automate manually intensive tasks like provisioning, operating and troubleshooting hardware-intensive networks.\nAn SDN network can also automatically respond to changes in network behavior. This enables a learning network where carriers can now better harness the plethora of data they have to improve performance and customize service offerings in ways that would have been impossible to do manually.  This is how network security can become an automated process based on best-fit policies for a carrier’s network.\n\nBridging the Silos of SDN\nBy separating the control and data planes, SDN is not limited by physical devices to control and manage traffic flows. With no physical barriers, SDN controllers can monitor traffic, detect threats, and mitigate attacks anywhere in the network with the use of a software-based network security solution.\nBut, it seems every equipment vendor provides a SDN controller that feeds in the carrier’s SDN control plane. The challenge is how to bridge the silos of multiple vendors’ SDN controllers to work together and provide telemetry to the SDN control plane where network security functions can feed off network wide data.\nPlan Now for SDN-enabled Network Security\nAs carriers move their SDN strategies from the white board to proof-of-concept trials to commercialization, now is the time to incorporate the right SDN-enabled network security solution. With multi-vendor interoperability and the ability to accept telemetry from multiple disparate sources, the right network security solution provides one automated control center for the entire network.\nThe network security solution can take advantage of the programmability of SDN to proactively provide better protection for the entire network at the least cost and provide previously unachievable network agility.\nOur new e-book – Taking advantage of SDN services to intelligently automate network security:  How to monitor and mitigate application and volumetric attacks with software driven policies – can help answer specific questions about the network security solutions that are available today that can tap into the automation benefits of SDN.\nThis is the second in a series of e-books designed to provide the latest information and thought leadership on security solutions for Carriers and Service Providers. You’ll learn more about how the right security solution can access telemetry from anywhere in the network to detect attacks, automatically mitigate the threat, and more effectively defend your network from harm with fewer resources.\nI’ll be speaking more about how to leverage a flexible SDN/NFV framework for real-time scaling of network security and intelligent services at the SDN World Congress in Dusseldorf, Germany on Thursday, October 15th at 15:00.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'network security\', \'SDN\', \'Service Providers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/plan-now-sdn-enabled-security/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (313, 'Evolved Cyber-Attacks Target Banks and Mis-Direct Their Network Protection', 'Werner Thalmeier', '2015-10-13', 'For many years banks have been a prime target for cyber-attacks. As of late though, publicly-known cyber-attacks in the financial industry seem to have remained static – in terms of attack frequency, duration and intensity. In reality, however, this is just the surface. There is still a significant threat of new attacks targeting banks and in many cases, the industry may not even be aware that they are under fire. This has the potential to cause even greater damage than a “public” Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack.\n\n2012 and 2013 were turbulent years for the financial industry. Operation Ababil kept US banks very busy and as a result, many banks invested a lot into their DDoS protection. The main purpose of those attacks was to bring down the infrastructure (or parts of it) and to disrupt business operations. That understanding translates to today, where many companies still believe that the main goal of a DDoS attack is to assault the availability of an infrastructure. But the real threat landscape can go far beyond this and DDoS attacks are often used to sidetrack the attention from a different intrusion that could go unnoticed for weeks, months, or even years. Companies and banks may think they have successfully mitigated a DDoS attack, but in reality an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) may have been installed, providing hackers full access to internal documents and financial data.\nThe (Mis)Direction of Advanced Persistent Threats and Stealth Attacks\nOne of the most spectacular cases of misdirection was performed by the international hacker group Carbanak, who started in late 2013 to secretly install APT malware in financial institutions. Until the beginning of 2015, they stole more than 1 Billion USD from more than 100 banks in 20 countries around the globe. The average attack length took between two to four months.\nEvery fan of action movies knows this trick. The aggressors create a huge mess at the front door, while stealth intruders enter through the back door. In the cyber-world, a DDoS attack represents this kind of mess and this is forcing existing protection infrastructure to fail.  All that is required now is for one part of the protection chain to fail (firewall, IPS/IDS) and the attackers will launch phase 2 and extend their attack to the application layer. This can be done with attacks like SQL injections or Cross Side Scripting Attacks (XSS) and they enable the installation of APTs – which will then start their dangerous mission under the hood.\nStealth attacks on banks work in a different way. They use low level, but constant DDoS attacks to tackle their victims.  According to research by the Radware ERT, more than 19% of DDoS attacks in 2014 were considered constant. This represents an increase of four times over the previous year.\n\nOne popular attack type is known as a Brute Force Attack. This attack focuses on log-in pages and has two purposes:  first, to keep the system busy with constant log-in queries and second, to search and find a legitimate user account and password to access the system.  What are the consequences of keeping a system “busy”?  Loading up the application and related infrastructure is one result, but these attacks can also lock the passwords of users. This creates significant additional load for the support help desk and the system administration to manage.\nStealth attacks are mainly done via HTTP or HTTP/S, which is at the application layer and this makes it very hard for regular protection solutions to identify and block because the system behaves as defined by RFC regulations.  In addition, many of the current security tools often work on separate islands and while that might be great for a dedicated attack, when it comes to a coordinated campaign across multiple attack layers, such isolated solutions will not succeed.\nFive Security Protection Tips to Remember\nIdentify and become aware of campaigns.\nSecurity vendors aren’t the only source for updates on attacks trends, tools and assailants. Other inter-trade organizations, governments and vendor-independent groups can also provide valuable information and support.\nCreate a security control center.\nEvery sensitive infrastructure, especially in finance, requires a central control and management center.  To protect against campaigns on multiple layers, a key requirement is to have all Information Technology and Application Management under one umbrella.\nDefine an emergency team.\nAn emergency response team, independent of the attack and the current infrastructure, is essential. They can detect many kinds of attacks and have the knowledge to mitigate them effectively. Attack detection and mitigation requires 365 day availability and often it makes sense to use a specialized external company for this.\nIdentify critical company data and related networks.\nActually the separation of networks is an old concept but still an obligatory requirement for security standards, such as PCI-DSS V2.0 and PCI-DSS V3.0. This will ensure that critical information will be operated in networks and infrastructure with a higher security profile.\nAvoid a domino effect.\nHow will my partners and contractors impact on my own IT Security? For example, what will happen to my bank operations when my ISP is under attack? Will online banking still available for my customers? What are the protection and security SLA’s from my provider?\nDDoS attacks are still a serious threat for companies and CISOs, however, APTs, Stealth Attacks and other attacks can also be damaging and a combination from both – is a very serious risk for every bank and organization. Attacks that use one or two attack vectors are the exception and attacks on multiple layers are becoming the standard now. The goal for many attackers is to go undiscovered so they can operate for as long as possible and gain extensive access to data and systems.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/evolved-attacks-target-banks/');

These distributed components require a framework to deliver centralized visibility into the health of the network from a security and application delivery perspective.Â  To optimize the mitigation controls, a defense messaging standard must be defined to enable the sharing of information across different platforms.\nAs I mentioned previously, the ADC is inherently a security detection and enforcement point in the network.Â  The ADC is responsible for applying application-aware, client-aware, content-aware, and session-aware security policies to detect and mitigate threats.\nBut just like the bank teller, it makes sense for the ADC to collect information about the application level attack that was detected and share that information with a perimeter security solution so that future attacks with that profile can be blocked from even entering the network.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Hackers\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/10/hackers-will-find-vulnerabilities/');

In the last few years we have seen a steady growth in Distributed Reflective Denial of Service attacks, DrDoS.  These attacks rely on misconfigured public servers and these public servers can provide an attacker with the amplification in bandwidth needed to take down their targeted site.\n\nMore recently, attackers have been exploring different UDP protocols to generate large volumetric attacks in a different way.  And just last month, the Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) saw the rise of a new UDP based reflection attack utilizing the RPC Portmapper service.\nPortmapper, also known as portmap and RPCbind, can be used to generate a 7-28 times amplification in bandwidth.  Portmapper runs on TCP or UDP port 111 and it is a service that is used to direct clients to the proper port number so they can communicate with the requested RPC service. Attackers are using the UDP protocol to launch these volumetric attacks because UDP is a connection-less protocol that does not validate the source IP address.  This allows attackers to send packets with a spoofed IP address resulting in the bandwidth amplification. In the event of a reflection attack, the packet sent back to the spoofed IP address is many times larger than the size of the original packet. This amplification can quickly overwhelm the targeted system.\nA way to measure the amplification is to use the Bandwidth Amplification Factor (BAF). The BAF is a measurement that compares the bytes of the payload sent versus the payload received. This comparison determines the size of the amplification. The RPC portmap attack does not provide the same amplification that CharGEN or NTP does but it highlights a growing trend in leveraging misconfigured servers for amplification.\n\nDrDoS attacks are hard to filter due to the fact that the requests are coming from legitimate services. Radware mitigates SSDP, NTP and DNS attacks daily with much larger amplification rates then what we see with this new RPC reflection attack.  In the case of the RPC reflection attack there is nothing to patch. Network operators can watch for anomalous activity and run network ingress filters. It is also recommended that you disable RPC services if not in use. If the service is required, filter the TCP/UDP ports of the RPC service by using a firewall and limiting external access.\nAccess control lists (ACLs) should be used as the most reliable and efficient solution for protecting the most important assets in your organization. ACLs can analyze the patterns and create signatures based on the attack insuring that legitimate users are not blocked.  A properly tuned behavior-based Denial of Service protection, BDOS, system with the correct footprint strictness will identify the anomaly and create a signature for the attack automatically.\nThis is just the beginning due to many other UDP services that have not been explored for the possibility of amplification. UDP amplification attacks are not going away any time soon due to the lack of complexity required to perform these attack.\nTo Learn More About Other Points of Failure in DDoS Attacks, Download the 2015 Global Application & Network Security Report by the Radware ERT\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Data Center Security\', \'ddos\', \'network security\', \'TCP\', \'UDP\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/09/portmapper-preying-on-servers/');

Reports state that attackers stole unknown amounts of data and government officials are now being forced to spend millions of euros on the cleanup to fix their entire computer system.\nThe attack (one of the biggest known against the German Government’s IT systems) first became public in May 2015 and while more background information has recently become available, understandably, even this available information is being handled with care. It has been revealed, however, that the majority of stolen data consisted of e-mails, Microsoft Outlook storage files (called PST) and office documents.\nHow Did the Attackers Operate and Get This Data?\nThe attackers placed a Trojan directly on government computers to gain administrative access.Â  How did they do it? Via old fashioned phishing e-mails.\nThe phishing e-mail had declared Angela Merkel as the mail sender and when sent to parliament members, they were asked to click on a link embedded in the mail. In the public debate that followed this hack, IT security professionals argued that this attack should have been easy to discover. The mail address from Angela Merkel was not the real Angela Merkel, it came from a market garden and it was visible this way. But easy to discover does not necessarily mean easy to prevent.\nAs part of this mail it was requested to click on a link to get more information on a specific topic, here it was more difficult to see that this is a spoofed address.Â  Behind this link there was a cluster of 12 infected servers located in Germany, Czech and Switzerland. Even with all the internal trainings and ongoing warnings that users should never click on suspicious links or attachments, it did not help and some users tried to access this content with all the known consequences.Â  Does this sound similar or to your day-to-day work and some of the mails you see on a daily basis?\n\nThe source of this cyber-attack is what has been occurring with a number of data breaches lately and many of my customers, colleagues, and personal friends have asked me, âhow can this happen and how can I avoid this?âÂ  They are justified in their concern, because if data can be stolen from a highly secured environment, like the German Parliament, with a simple phishing e-mail installing a Trojan, what does it mean for them?\nWhat Can I Do to Protect and Secure My Data?\nTo give you some guidance on what you can (or better âshouldâ) do, there are some key elements of data security and privacy that focuses specifically on e-mails.Â  Some of the points sound so fundamental and you may have heard them many times already.Â  Yet I am 100% sure that many of you (including those in your company) donât follow them consistently or donât have them in place.\n#1 – Before you open an attachment or follow a link, ALWAYS verify the author or source\nThis is the most important rule! When you get an e- mail or go on a website, make sure it is valid and legitimate. Donât click on it just because it looks interesting. This is such an old tactic and phishing mails or âdrive-byâ malware on websites have been out there for so many years, but, unfortunately, they are still successful and work as a proven cyber-attack.Â  One wrong click can screw up your system and instead of having a âpersonal computerâ you will have a âZombieâ system, controlled remotely. All data can be stolen or compromised, exactly like it happened at the German Parliament.\nUnfortunately, I have a personal example for this. A friend of mine visited me last weekend and he was desperate because he had clicked on an e-mail extension, disguised as an invoice from a âbank.â This is a classic phishing mail and right after the click, malware started to install. His computer started to run many tasks on the disc and after a first external screening (there are many good tools available for such an emergency, I used Desinfecât, a LINUX-based tool kit in this case ) of his computer, we found over 115 malware pieces (Trojans, viruses, etc.).\nIt took nearly half of the weekend to clean up the system and at the end we could still not be certain that we caught all of malware on the computer. My final advice was to move forward with a fresh installation on a new hard disc or replace the complete system to be on the safe side again.\nWas my friend inexperienced and did he not know what could happen? Actually not at all! He was working for a bank and has had much internal training on IT Security about how to handle such e-mails. But all that was needed was a moment of distraction and a wrong mouse click to create a mess.\n#2 – Have a verified backup (and test it!)\nThe best option for my friend in the story was to have a fresh install on a new disk. Unfortunately, he had no backup of his data or of his operating system.\nHere we are at rule #2, have an accessible and working backup, at least of your data and make sure you know how to use it. There are so many good tools available (such as Acronis True Image, Symantec Ghost, Paragon Backup, Disc Dump based on LINUX) and an external disk, connected via USB, is all you need in your private environment. Take a minute to ask yourself, do you have a current backup? Do you know if it works?\n#3 – Encrypt your data and mails.\nWhat would have happened with the attack on the German Parliament if e-mails and data had been encrypted? The damage (and awareness of the damage) would have been much less. Essentially, all e-mails and data that are not encrypted are public. Encryption is a major component that can increase your security.\nWhat Can You Do As A Company To Help Keep Your Data Secure?\nAt the end of the day, you have to ask yourself about your personal and companyâs security plans. Itâs necessary to build the required lines of defense as well as adopt security policies to keep control of your data and privacy.\nThe first step is to raise awareness among your teams about threats. This needs to be a constant process and a habit to be successful and to reduce the risks of attacks.Â  Another major step is for companies to implement a specific detection solution, such as Radware Inflight. This solution uses real-time intelligence on the network and has the ability to identify security threats and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTâs) embedded in any kind of web transactions.Â  Being aware of the threats and reporting the threats can help avoid the need to defeat the threats. Networks can have weaknesses and motivated attackers will use a variety of tactics to get to the data and information they want.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Attack Detection\', \'Botnets\', \'data breach\', \'information security\', \'network security\', \'Phishing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/09/government-breach-could-happen-to-you/');

You can practically feel the intensity of brute force or volumetric DDoS attacks. These attacks target layers 1-4 of operator networks, the layers where data is moved around in the network. But, there’s a troubling blind spot in legacy network security solutions that enables hackers to go deeper into the operators network – all the way through to Layer 7, the application layer.\n\nAttacks on the application layer aim to hone in on specific applications or functions by mimicking legitimate user traffic with the intent to cripple functionality or gain access to digital assets.\nWhat Are Application Attacks?\nBrute force and volumetric attacks are aptly named because they use up as much bandwidth as possible when going after a carriers’ network. Application attacks have more finesse, generating very little traffic as they send targeted commands to applications to overwhelm central processing units (CPU) and memory. \nThese attacks may go undetected and this “noisy traffic” can significantly slow legitimate traffic or cause network outages. With legacy systems, mitigation requires labor-intensive manual intervention because there’s no automated method to handle the threat. If and when network security solutions do sense a NetFlow-based volumetric attack with an application component, manual mitigation can take 15 to 20 minutes. By the time the security team has developed a strategy, the attackers have likely morphed to new signatures.\nHacker’s Favorite Application Attack Tricks\nHackers continue to develop new and more sophisticated methods to launch application attacks. Some of their favorite advanced techniques include:\n\nHeadless browser requests – Tools that function as a browser but without the graphical user interface. They can be used to bypass third-generation HTTP challenges. Their goal is to take websites down.\nBotnet attacks from multiple IP sources – Attacks that target legacy DDoS systems with malware that infects multiple IP devices and then uses this network of computers to coordinate an attack from a changing list of IP addresses.\nAttacks from behind CDNs – Attacks launched from behind a CDN that is used to mask the source IP address and target the vulnerability of legacy systems trying to find the source IP address.\nSSL-encrypted attacks – Attackers understand that small SSL attacks can cause large problems based on both the encryption tunnel, which hides the attack itself, and an understanding that legacy systems require large amounts of CPU capacity to decrypt and detect attacks, thereby crippling their throughput.\nNew low and slow attacks/Advanced Persistent Threats – Very patient attacks that slowly drain server resources over time. Zero day attacks of this type can be extremely difficult to detect since at any point in time there is low probability that an attack is active.\n\nWhy Should Carriers Care?\nMany carriers lack the tools to even detect the presence of application attacks.  And these attacks put carriers’ reputations at risk. For customers, a slow down in services may not be a big deal initially. But, as the number and severity of application attacks increases, clogged pipes and slow services are not going to be acceptable.\nThe impact of application attacks on carriers and their customers takes many forms:\n\nService degradation\nNetwork outages\nData exposure\nConsumption of bandwidth resources\nConsumptions of system resources\n\nCarriers sell services based on speed and reliability. Bad press about service outages and data compromises have long lasting negative effects. Add the compounding power of social networking to quickly spread the word about service issues, and you have a recipe for reputation disaster.\nWhat Can Carriers Do Now?\nA new eBook from Radware –  How Do You Stop What you Can’t See; The Imminent Threat of Application Attacks and How to Defend Against Them – can help answer specific questions about solutions available today to detect and mitigate application attacks.\nThis is the first in a series of e-books designed to provide the latest information and thought leadership on security solutions for Carriers and Service Providers.  You’ll learn more about why application attacks are on the rise, who is responsible, and how these attacks can penetrate legacy network security solutions.  Application attacks impact your ability to provide highly-available, high-performance network services for your customers, so learn the best strategies to protect your network now and in the future.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Application Attacks\', \'attack mitigation\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/09/attacks-take-advantage-of-holes/');

No WAF today can provide protection  against application level attacks launched overt the HTTP/2 protocol stack,  potentially leaving HTTP/2 based web applications vulnerable.\nCustomers that use a  WAF to protect their applications and want to benefit from the performance  enhancements that come with HTTP/2, need to first find out if their WAF  supports the new HTTP/2 protocol or not. Chances are that it doesn’t…Â \nWhy is my WAF not working?\n  If the WAF you use does not support HTTP/2, many web  application level attacks could pass under its radar undetected if HTTP/2 is  used to communicate with the server. \n Here’s why:\n  In a typical environment, the application web servers will be upgraded to  support HTTP/2.Â  The WAF, which is  sitting in front of the server, will see the client-server communication using  the HTTP/2 protocol.Â  Even if the WAF is  able to see the decoded encrypted content, until the WAF is upgraded to support  HTTP/2, it is unlikely that it will be able to detect most of the web  application level attacks (even simple ones like a HTTP flood).\n\nDoes that mean that HTTP/2 is not for  me? Not necessarily.\n It is possible to support HTTP/2 and maintain a  proper security model. This requires the deployment of a HTTP/2  gateway in front of the web application’s server farm. This gateway is used  to translate the client browsers’ communication from HTTP/2 to HTTP 1.1 towards  the server, and vice versa. \n\nIn this model, the WAF that sits in front of the web server  farm will see all communication between the browser and server as the HTTP 1.1  protocol, since the HTTP/2 gateway in front of it will translate all  communication from HTTP/2 to HTTP 1.1 and vice versa. Meaning that even if your  WAF only supports HTTP 1.1, it will  stillÂ  continue to provide web  application level protection, even if the attacks are launched over the new  HTTP/2 protocol.\nYour WAF and HTTP/2 Gateway Should  Work Together\n  When the WAF and the HTTP/2 gateway are both part of the  same ADC unit (which provides all the application delivery services for that  web application including load balancing, security, and HTTP/2 gateway  functionality), it is important to ensure these functions are properly  implemented and operating in the ADC device.\n It should first provide the HTTP/2 gateway functionality,  translating the traffic to HTTP 1.1.Â   Only then should the traffic run through the WAF module and at the end  of the process, route the traffic to the appropriate web application server.  This process enables a WAF to still provide its full protection â even for  transactions carried over HTTP/2.\n Supporting  HTTP/2 provides many benefits including performance and privacy for the end  users accessing the web application. However, there are many considerations  that might prevent application owners from adopting HTTP/2 natively on their  servers today. Adopting the new protocol with an HTTP/2 gateway returns most,  if not all, of these benefits and can aid in solving many of the migration  challenges.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'HTTP2\', \'WAF\', \'web performance optimization\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/09/http2-security-fix/');

It’s a natural reaction to the seemingly endless stream of news about large volumetric attacks. Add to that the natural migration of many applications to the cloud and the cloud momentum really gets rolling.\n\nCertainly, cloud-based resources should play an important part in a sound cyber-attack protection strategy. But those falling into a belief they are the be-all-end-all for protection will leave themselves exposed to a number of threats and risks based on the limitations of cloud-only protection.\nIt is important to be aware of the shortcomings of many cloud-only solutions and consider them when planning for attack protection. There are inherent challenges of putting all of your faith in the cloud versus a balanced architecture, one that leverages cloud strengths but adds support through on premise components.\nWeâve Come Quite a Ways\nBefore getting into some of the specific challenges posed by cloud-only protection, letâs take a step back and recognize how far we’ve come. It wasn’t long ago that many were learning about the challenges of using firewalls and IDS/IPS to protect from advanced cyber-attacks. Now, it would be untrue to say we never see or hear this anymore… there are still segments of the information security audience that still want to look at a firewall or IPS as a panacea from all malicious threats.\nBy and large, the notion that a stateful device can protect from large floods or even more sophisticated application attacks that require visibility into request-and-response had dwindled significantly over the past 2-3 years. Certainly, the benefits of purpose-built protections from advanced cyber-attacks such as DDoS got a big vote of confidence when Cisco recently announced the OEMâing of Radware’s DDoS protection into the Firepower 9300 series. The technology is meant to compliment separate FW/IPS capabilities also on the product.\nWhy So Cloud-Centric?\nLet’s examine a few of the reasons why so many organizations are thinking (or maybe just hoping) cloud-based solutions hold the answer to their security challenges.\n\nFirst, the news headlines…  this is not to suggest that information security professionals are a bunch of mindless drones following the tome of what they see in the news. But the overwhelming volume of news related to the “mega-attacks”(many hundreds of Gbps) are impossible to ignore or even keep from seeping into our psyche. To give you a sense of just how dominant this topic has been of late, I took a look through the last 45 days of “DDoS” keyword-triggered (non-vendor) news in my various news feeds and discovered that nearly two-thirds of these stories relate directly to volumetric threats or specific attacks.\nThis impact arguably has an even greater effect on executive management. The panicked reaction to hearing about yet another peer or competitor falling in the face of these threats generates a lot of “don’t let that happen to us” pressure down onto the security and networking teams.\nAdd to this the undeniable dynamic that information security teams and professionals have an overwhelming number of threats to monitor, detect and defend against. The sense of having to keep up with the rapidly evolving and advanced tool sets of malicious actors causes many to turn attention towards outside solutions that at first glance would seem to put the least burden on internal resources for management and maintenance. Fortunately, there are many good outsourced managed services offerings that don’t expose the organization to the shortcomings of cloud-only architectures.\n\nOK, so without further ado letâs get into what we see as the biggest challenges facing cloud-only solutions, the first of which Iâll explore in this blog and the others in subsequent follow on posts:\n1. Unnecessary redirecting of traffic in peacetime\n2. Burden of attack detection often falls back to the end customer\n3. Lack of intelligence from perimeter to improve speed and accuracy of mitigation\n4. Inability to effectively and efficiently handle non-volumetric threats\n\nCloud-Only Protection Challenge #1: Redirecting traffic in peacetime\nThere is a saying that articulates a philosophy on cyber-attack protection… “detect where you can, mitigate where you should.”\nThere are many benefits to a distributed attack mitigation system, including the situation of mitigating large volumetric attacks near major peering points. Or alternatively, mitigating application threats close to the application itself.\nWhat is clear, however, is that the decision made by some to redirect all application or website traffic to third-party cloud security service providers is driven by something other than optimal security architecture.Â  Rather, it seems to stem from a basic desire to make the attacks someone elseâs problem to mitigate. Ironic when you consider that for some the exploration of cloud-based solutions stems from the bias against âputting yet another device in the network.â So the response is to pass all traffic over to a third party? \nThis, however, can introduce often non-trivial latency into the application’s performance. I think we can agree that in some cases small amounts of latency are not deal-breakers. These can be good candidates for cloud based protection for both network layer and application layer attacks. However, many applications (often those an organization determines it cannot host in the cloud) require the minimal latency that comes from full management of the application infrastructure.\nAnother often overlooked shortcoming of the cloud-only approach to cyber-attack protection is that what can be called the “collateral damage” risk. For providers delivering an always-on cloud option to customers, you quickly can see how a collection of attacks targeting a growing customer base creates a threat against all customers. Alternatively, organizations that leverage cloud resources in conjunction with on-premises components incur none of this risk when they are at peacetime, and generally are able to get better detection of attacks that can be mitigated without having to swing traffic. In fact, Radware customers, representing many of the worldâs largest organizations across what you might call core cyber-attack prone industries see 85% of attacks are able to be mitigated fully by the on-premises components.\nI’m not here to propose cloud-based attack protection has no place in sound security architecture. But the tendencies of organizations to overreact to the headlines and jump to the conclusion that cyber-attack protection equals only volumetric attack protection warrants correction. So too does the notion that all application layer threats are best mitigated in the existing flow of traffic through cloud resources. Over the coming weeks, we’ll take a deeper look at some of the other challenges the cloud-only approach brings into play for both volumetric network threats and application layer attacks.\nIf youâd like to learn more about a balanced attack mitigation solution that leverages the benefits of cloud, but still offers optimal protection, download our white paper “Cyber Security Just Got Easier”.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cloud Security\', \'information security\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/09/headlines-cloud-security-decisions/');

In an attempt to provide some guidance on how to make better security decisions on the Internet, I’ve honed these ten immutable thoughts for consumer-level security:\n\n1. Consider it public.\nUnencrypted data stored in the cloud should be considered public even if you believe it is not.\n2. Encryption of data should be accomplished by the data owner.\nDo not depend on the caretaker. If the caretaker also encrypts, that’s a bonus! Encryption can be done easily by either buying encryption programs, leveraging open source, or even better, if you are a business, come up with your own technology – it really isn’t hard!\n3. Encryption of data should be as unique as possible.\nStandard encryption is an oxy-moron and the origin of many data spills. It may consist of outdated methods that have been around since the 1970s!  The whole concept around encryption is that few people understand the codes, and it is even better if they don’t understand the algorithms. Ideally, encryption is ‘need to know.’  In our world of perverted security through standard approaches we have departed from the foundation of the need of encryption.\n4. Change your security model routinely.\nEvery time you prepare your personal taxes, you should change your security model. This consists of changing passwords, changing operating systems or versions, changing security vendors, changing as much as possible. Changing your architecture is a lot of work, but in the long run your departure from the old and adoption of the new will serve you well. The reason? The effectiveness of different security models can decay over time. Consider churning your credit card provider too – this is a very powerful technique in avoiding scams and fraud.\n5. NEVER trust a site with anything less than two-factor authentication.\nThe more you can combine the following attributes to authenticate into a website, the more secure it is:\n\na password (something you know)\na token / device such as a USB fob (something you have)\nneed to leverage biometrics such as fingerprints (something you are)\nvoice recognition and technology which leverages geo-location (somewhere you are)\n\n\n6. Turn your computer off when not online.\nWhy? Because one can’t access a computer which is off.   True, soon they will be able turn on a computer which is off from which we can to disable cords, etc.  However, today it is sufficient to turn off your computer.\n7. Avoid using popular, standard or free software.\nThe more standard (such as Windows, Adobe, Android, Apple, etc.) and open the less secure. The more unique, closed and arcane, the more secure. Some example of closed, unique and arcane software is something which was developed internally to your company and few outside of your company understand it’s workings or attributes.\n8. Ease of use is a foe of security.\nAvoid the easy route and encourage obstacles. Obstacles to you are also obstacles to potential perpetrators and data thieves.\n9. Pay attention to the grey areas.\nGrey is where the black hat hackers (bad guys) lurk. So if you don’t have clarity around the security of something (e.g. Cloud explanations, etc.) you don’t have security.\n10. Trust, but verify.\nRequire your vendors to prove the security of data. Constant downtime of a vendor translates to a broken vendor with bad security. Use outages as an excuse to get updates from your vendor relationships – including your banks!\nYour daily security activities can provide opportunity to traverse far and wide from the foundational principles of security. Understanding the key principles of security will assist in architecting and directing your security controls.\nWhat is clear is that the pace and veracity of threats will continued to expand.

The network security solution deployed by many carriers does not provide a complete picture of what is attacking their networks.\n Legacy security solutions are missing the complete picture because they are blind to application attacks.  Generally, volumetric attacks at the network layer and even some well-known application attack vectors are sensed and mitigated because this is what the current solution is designed to handle.  There is a troubling blind spot, however, when it comes to new and changing application attacks.\nDuring application attacks, targeted commands are sent to applications to overwhelm the CPU and memory. When the attack goes undetected, “noisy traffic” can slow all traffic significantly, or even cause network outages.\nYou See It, But Now Can You Stop It?\nA top complaint in carrier security is that mitigating an attack takes too long, requires manual intervention and has a high rate of false positives.  If legacy network security solutions do recognize a new, malicious application attack (like a zero-day attack) it can take minutes or hours to troubleshoot the unknown signature in the application layer.\nMitigation requires labor-intensive manual intervention because there is no automated method to handle zero-day attacks. By the time the security team has developed a strategy, the attackers have likely morphed to new signatures. Carriers need a better way to protect their networks against application attacks.\nThere Are Answers\nCarriers must be vigilant in protecting both their own networks and those of their enterprise customers.  A new eBook from Radware – How Do You Stop What You Can’t See: The Imminent Threat of Application Attacks and How to Defend Against Them – can help answer specific questions about how to proactively detect and mitigate application attacks.\nThis is the first in a series of e-books designed to provide the latest information and thought leadership on security solutions for Carriers and Service Providers.  You’ll learn more about why application attacks are on the rise, who is responsible, and how these attacks can penetrate legacy network security solutions.  Application attacks impact your ability to provide highly-available, high-performance network services for your customers, so learn the best strategies to protect your network now and in the future.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'attack mitigation\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\', \'Service Providers\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/08/major-threat-to-carrier-security/');

Hereâs The Ultimate Guide', 'Ben Desjardins', '2015-6-22', 'Every good hero needs a trusty guide.\nSherlock Holmes had his Watson. Bruce Wayne had Alfred. Captain Kirk? He had Spock. Todayâs information security professionals are no different. They work in the trenches to protect networks and applications and they are the modern day heroes of our digital lives. And thus, a guide for keeping up with the fast evolving cyber-threat landscape is valuable when supporting combat.\n\nToday at Radware, weâre pleased to provide a new tool to this community with the release of our newly updated DDoS Handbook. The handbook is subtitled âThe Ultimate Guide to Everything You Need to Know About DDoS Attacksâ and while no single document could be the be-all-end-all of cyber-attack education, it does provide a unique level of foundational knowledge. The handbook is built from the Radware teamâs insights gleaned from over 10 years of battling DDoS attacks. Protecting some of the largest, most network dependent, and most targeted organizations in the world from an array of attack campaigns affords this team a truly unique level of knowledge about attack detection, motivation and mitigation.\nFoundational Knowledge is Necessary\nIf you listen to any number of industry experts, they will tell you that it is nearly impossible for IT or information security staff to keep fully up-to-date on the evolution of cyber-attacks. There is a lot of truth in these statements; especially in the context of real-time threat mitigation against something like Zero-Day Attacks. In response to this challenge, there are many vendors ready to support security operators in maintaining their visibility of the threat landscape. But it is important to keep in mind that these vendorsâ products and services donât replace the need for foundational knowledge within the organization about the general direction of cyber-attacks. Organizations that interpret the purchase of the latest and greatest security product or those that move to a managed security service as an opportunity to relieve themselves of responsibility, will lose in the end.\nFor those new to the topic of DDoS attacks, this handbook can provide a starting point in understanding. Who, you might ask, would be new to the topic? The fact is that DDoS attacks are targeting entirely new industries and market segments that previously would disregard these attacks as a concern only for big banks or large ecommerce players. Those days are gone. Nearly every day, we find ourselves engaged in discussions with an organization from a new market segment showing concern over this threat, often in response to a specific incident. The DDoS Handbook gives members of these teams a strong foundation in the background and history of DDoS attacks. There is also a wealth of information on the evolution of motives, different attack types and the tools utilized by todayâs attackers.\nThe Expanse of DDoS\nRadware has been building and supporting defenses for DDoS attacks for over 10 years. When we got started, DDoS attacks were still a relatively niche segment of security threats and protection was viewed as an isolated tactic within the security operation. This has changed dramatically over the past few years. Protection from volumetric threats has become not only a foundational element for increasingly network-dependent companies but also a strategic pillar as these threats often combine elements of other attack types.\nIn a recent briefing, I was told that as much as 40% of customer inquiries include a DDoS protection discussion. This rise of strategic focus for DDoS highlights the importance of viewing attacks in the broader context of enterprise security. The handbook supports this, through a chapter devoted to the rapid changes around the network perimeter and its impact on security. Trends related to the increased use of Content Delivery Networks, cloud computing and virtualization are also explored.\nExperienced Advice Helps\nBackground and history are great, but any DDoS handbook would be incomplete without clear and proven advice on preparation and response. The handbook delivers a comprehensive chapter that highlights business and attack trends and provides a set of best practices for organizations to consider when planning for cyber-attacks. Learn the critical points of evaluation for protective measures as well as some valuable Doâs and Donâts for attack preparation, attack response and post-attack analysis.\nAn Outlook and a Resource\nWhere is the DDoS threat headed? The experience our team has weâve earned in the DDoS space has led to sharpened radar on what new tactics represent a meaningful shift in attack strategy vs. something that is a limited trend that could be addressable through basic protection updates. The updated âDDoS dictionaryâ is also a great go-to resource for maintaining an individual or organizational DDoS knowledge base. Iâm not ashamed to admit that this is a tool I use frequently in my own work on the topic.\nThere is a saying that âthe right tool in the wrong handsâ will always lead to failure. In creating and maintaining the DDoS Handbook, we address both the challenge of the tool and the capabilities of its operator. This foundation can support individuals that play a part in the protection strategies and tactics for their organization. Detailed attack profiles and clear advice, are a valuable tool to supplement products and services that comprise an enterprise security strategy.\nDownload\nRadwareâs DDoS Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Everything You Need to Know about DDoS Attacks\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'ddos\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/06/what-do-you-know-about-ddos-attacks/');

The ShellShock Vulnerability released last year was open for 25 years! What is happening now that is causing us to just get around to finding out about these flaws?\n\nWhat is happening is the evolution of virtual machines (VMs). VMs are operating systems or application environments installed on software that are meant to imitate dedicated hardware. Essentially, these machines aim to offer the end user the same experience virtually as they would have on dedicated hardware. These virtual machines are managed by a hypervisor, a program that facilitates the multiple operating systems.\nThe use of VMs and hypervisors have presented challenges for security professionals in the past because of security concerns where malware can exploit the virtual machine and threats can be posed to the hypervisor itself. This trend looks like it may be set to continue.\nHere are 5 reasons why Virtual Machine and Hypervisor Security might become a challenge for security professionals in the future.\n\n\n\nVM Escape: If we are just getting around to finding flaws in the Floppy Disk Driver, are there other driver instances that could also allow for this break out? How high is the risk of the VM interacting with the host system?\n\n\n \n\n\nOpenSSL Vulnerabilities: Previous VM Escape vulnerabilities applied only to a single virtualization platform or they didn’t directly allow for arbitrary code execution. OpenSSL vulnerabilities that continue to plague encryption could become the start of something more.\n\n\n \n\n\nAPT Vulnerabilities and Backdoors: RAM scraping attacks are one way that APT vulnerabilities and backdoors can be exploited. Viewing CPU states from a provider level is easy and revealed to be in use by the PRISM program. What guarantees that there aren’t view states open to others?\n\n\n \n\n\nProvider Protections: What if an insider purposely creates a backdoor in a VM? Will your cloud provider have the detection and mitigation capabilities for this?\n\n\n \n\nFuture Patches:  With virtualization happening on network devices as well as servers there could be a large region of patchwork in the future. Will we have to patch all of the ADCs and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) platforms every time a new exploit comes out?\n\nThese scenarios are things we have to ask ourselves about as security professionals. Application testing needs to be aggressively done, but is it getting done, and if so, who is doing this testing? It seems that more and more vendors are just releasing products and this leaves us all vulnerable to the next headline-grabbing threat that has gone undiscovered for the past decade. What we need to do as security professionals is ensure that both the hypervisor and virtual instances are protected. A way to do this is to have thorough protection that includes on hypervisor behavior anomaly detection and virtual instance protection including hybrid solutions that are platform agnostic.

According to Aberdeen Group research, the cost of a one second delay in website load time can translate to a 7% reduction in conversion rate and up to $2.5 million in losses per year.  The cost of outage?  That can reach nearly half a million dollars per hour.\n\nAttacks have evolved in multiple dimensions:\n\nAttack motivation. Cybercrime remains a major motivation; however hacktivism, espionage and warfare are more frequently added to the mix.\nAttacks are now longer, more complex and continuous. Attackers are deploying more multi-vector (e.g., different types) attack campaigns that target all layers of the victim’s IT infrastructure. This includes the network, server and application layers.  Attackers are also growing more patient and persistent – leveraging low & slow attack techniques that aim to misuse the application resource rather than resources in the network stacks.  These more evasive techniques, which can include SSL-based attacks and attacks launched behind CDNs or Proxy servers, can avoid detection and mitigation.\nAttacks are becoming harder to detect and mitigate. Rate-based detection systems become useless against low & slow attack vectors and the application misuse attacks that imitate real user traffic.  Mitigation of attacks in this manner can result with the blocking of legitimate user traffic, since most mitigation tools block attacks based on source IP addresses and not attack pattern.\n\nService Providers (SPs) face unique challenges when protecting their business and network infrastructure.  The explosive growth of video, wireless mobility, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services are some of the trends that present both business opportunities and security challenges.  To meet technological demand, SPs are more frequently adopting open and programmable network architectures to increase business agility and reduce costs. Cyber attackers are exploiting this growing surface and the openness of systems, and this poses a direct risk to business operations, brand reputation, and the customers they serve.\nTo address this growing need for SPs to protect their network service and to act as a platform to increase services revenue, Cisco Systems has launched the Firepower 9300 – a carrier-class, multi-service security platform.  Featuring Cisco ASA Firewall, Radware DefensePro DDoS Mitigation and additional security services such as Cisco Next Generation Intrusion Prevention (NGIPS), Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) and URL Reputation filtering – this is thorough protection, all in a single appliance.  Cisco has chosen Radware as an OEM partner and is adding its leading DDoS Mitigation technology to its security capabilities purpose-built for service provider security needs. \nCisco selected Radware’s DDoS mitigation technology for its ability to accurately detect and mitigate cyber threats – in particular those targeting application availability – in the shortest amount of time.  This DDoS mitigation technology is a real-time, behavioral-based detection and mitigation solution that detects all type of network and application DDoS attacks and mitigates them accurately without blocking legitimate user traffic.\nThe market for cloud and managed service security is projected to reach $18B by 2016 and SPs face enormous challenges in securing networks and services – from threat evaluation to attacks detection and mitigation to security service management.  All of this is necessary, without inhibiting service delivery, network agility, speed, or scalability.\nThe OEM agreement between Cisco and Radware acknowledges joint leadership in attack mitigation and DDoS protection.  Radware and Cisco already partner around Cisco key data center initiatives to deliver next generation application delivery and security solutions for Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI), Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) and Cisco Open SDN solutions.  This latest venture is an exciting extension of our partnership and the mutual technologies and goals to strive to keep SPs protected against the evolving cyber-threat landscape.\nRead more about the Radware Cisco OEM Agreement\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Cisco\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/06/radware-and-cisco-oem-agreement/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (328, 'Microsoft TMG EOL Got You Down? Here are Options for Replacements', 'David Monahan', '2015-6-3', 'David Monahan is Research Director for Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) and is a featured guest blogger.\nI was recently briefing with a  customer when a question was raised about Microsoft Forefront Threat Management  Gateway (TMG) and its end of life. The question was what would be my recommendations  for replacing it. My first glib thought was “quickly” but I bit my tongue and  went on with a better formed recommendation along the same lines.\n\n Microsoft TMG is a multifunction  security gateway that acts as an Internet traffic proxy gateway providing  additional network antivirus scanning, firewall, VPN termination, and web  caching services.  From a value  standpoint, it was an attempt to provide more, with less of a datacenter  footprint, by integrating common/commodity security services. And it did this  when there weren’t a lot of vendors delivering composite solutions.  I have never supported it so I can’t speak to  how well it performed but it lasted for 15 years in its varied incarnations so  adoption/market acceptance must have been reasonable. The final iteration of  the solution was discontinued in 2012 and hits the end of mainstream support in  2015 with extended support going through 2020.\n As with any product that has been  “end of life-d,” there are no more vendor resources being applied to producing  features. There are also few to no efforts being applied to proactively develop  patches. With all of the vulnerabilities being found, publicized and exploited,  it is merely a matter of time before we see the remaining production devices  compromised. So, owners should have a plan to migrate to another technology,  regardless of whether it is still working and/or support is available.  Several other concerns are the lack of  support for OS’s beyond Microsoft Server 2008 R2; no more native support for newer  versions of Microsoft applications like Exchange and SharePoint and the  built-in deployment wizards only provide support for publishing Exchange and  SharePoint 2010 (which, require significantly more manual configuration and raising  additional supportability issues). TMG cannot be supported on Microsoft Server  2012 and even if you can install it, it doesn’t take advantage of some of the  newer security features built into that OS.\n Usefulness and performance of  some of the advanced features will begin to decline in 2016. As of December 31,  2015, Microsoft announced cessation of support for the URL Reputation Services  (URS) that TMG uses for web site categorization. They will also discontinue  production of anti-malware and Network Inspection System (NIS) signature  updates, so newer threats will not be detected. The deprecation of these  functions means that if you’re relying on these services to provide intelligent  threat management for the advanced forward web proxy they will be significantly  impacted well before the support expires for the product.\n Maybe I am a bit naïve but I would  have expected that with more than two years of notice, organizations using the  TMG would already be engaged in research with plans for procurement and  deploying a replacement product. The good news is there are plenty of options.  Whether you are using all of its functionality or only parts of it, there are a  myriad of companies that offer comparable and even greater combined  functionality with equal and higher performance.  If you are only looking for one or two  functions, vendors supply them as point solutions and they are relatively easy  to research.\n For those looking to replace the  combined functionality, I would recommend reviewing vendors delivering Unified  Threat Management (UTM) solutions. UTM’s provide next-generation (and proxy)  firewall,  network intrusion prevention, VPN termination, gateway  antivirus (AV), gateway anti-spam email inspection,  content  filtering, load balancing,  network-based data leak prevention (DLP), and  on-appliance reporting services.  By this  point, considerable similarities with TMG should be obvious.\n Organizations already using TMG  should already know the Pros and Cons of a UTM deployment. For the broader  audience, I think it is important to mention a few of the more key aspects.  First, using a single integrated device and service reduces overall complexity  and simplifies deployment, lifecycle management, and support. Second, a single  vendor/solution reduces technical training requirements and costs. Lastly, the  unified reporting for all services simplifies regulatory compliance management  and reporting. The top vendors in the space not only have a singular appliance  but also use key-based licensing activation rather than module installation. The  code base is unified so when you need new services, you only need to purchase  the activation key and install it to activate the feature.  You do not need to upgrade or install new  components.\n Key disadvantages for the UTM solutions include the possibility of a  single point of compromise. If a single technology vendor is deployed and is  found to have a vulnerability that leaves the protected organization more  vulnerable. Scoping for performance and size is a crucial factor, not only for  the current environment but for the environment that is expected to exist in  the lifecycle of the product (3-5 years) so a “rip-and-replace” or other  similarly impacting upgrade is not necessary to keep up with traffic processing  requirements. As with any inline solution, a solid high-availability option and  back-up and restore process are crucial to avoid extended outages due to attack  or failure.\nAlso note: Most vendors in this space do not currently offer a  software only or virtual machine image installation due to the high system  resources required to drive all of these functions.  Investigate any claims for these options by  comparing them to the dedicated hardware form similar and other competing  vendors.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Microsoft\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/06/microsoft-tmg-eol-replacements/');

The scene of the 1902 Paris murder of Joseph Reibel held little in the way of clues, no signs of robbery and no witnesses to speak of.  There was however, one piece of physical evidence observed by an innovative criminologist named Alphonse Bertillon. A fingerprint left on a broken plane of glass. At that time, few criminologists would have even noticed such a thing, much less considered it a tool in identifying suspects. But Bertillon, already recognized for introducing new methods of identification, went through the laborious task of comparing the print with thousands he had on record of individuals with previous convictions. And sure enough, a match emerged; an ex-convict named Henri-Leon Scheffer, who subsequently confessed to the crime. And like that, history was made in the use of fingerprints as a means of identification.\n A not entirely dissimilar movement is afoot in information security. The advancement of device fingerprinting as a dramatic improvement upon the use of IP addresses for identification and blocking. Perhaps more notable as the advancements in device fingerprinting are the reasons that we believe we are seeing the death of the IP address as the primary tool for device identification. \n Here are five reasons the IP address has a rapidly decreasing value in security, all of which are primary motivations for the development of device fingerprinting technology within security products:\n\n\nDynamic IP:  Today’s reality is that many users access the Internet through providers using dynamic hosting configuration that results in a new IP address each time they access the Internet. When you combine this with the increased mobility of today’s user, organizations are quickly faced with a challenging situation with regard to user identification.\n\n\nDevices behind NAT:  Users accessing the Internet through Network Address Translation (NAT) devices result in many devices sharing the same IP address, making it difficult to block IPs without potentially blocking legitimate users/devices.\n\n\nBrowsing through Anonymous Proxies:  A large number of anonymous proxy services have cropped up in recent years, largely in response to privacy advocates seeking ways to avoid personal identification of users. Trouble is, they also provide an excellent cover for bad actors.\n\n\nIP Spoofing:  Any number of tools are readily available that enable users (including criminals) to modify or forge the header of an IP packet to include a false source IP address. This tactic can be used to seek high levels of access when spoofing IPs of trusted machines, or simply to evade detection based on IP addresses previously blacklisted.\n\n\nAccessing Origin Servers through a CDN:  Content Delivery Network services have grown to support a high percentage of ecommerce traffic on the Internet. For all their benefits related to acceleration of browsing, CDNs create a number of security challenges, including the challenge of needing to whitelist IPs of the CDN in order to ensure access to origin server content. Criminals often exploit this by making multiple, malicious login attempts while masking their own IP. For more on this dynamic, take a look at my colleague David Hobbs’ recent blog post on CDNs\n\n\nWhat is clear from these examples is that we’ve reached a tipping point on use of IP address as the means of precise user or device identification. The IP address has “jumped the shark” if you will, and needs to be replaced by new, more accurate technologies that are not prone to error caused by some of the dynamic listed above. Enter the device fingerprint, a rapidly growing technology that employs various tools and methodologies to gather IP-agnostic information about the source, including running a JavaScript on the client side. The device fingerprint uniquely identifies a web tool entity by combining sometimes dozens of attributes of a user’s device to identify and then track their activities, generating a behavioral and reputational profile of the user.\nMuch like Scheffer did over a hundred years ago, users and devices will leave clues over time about their intentions within an application. Identification of their behavior as anomalous, potentially malicious can be tracked over time to define a degree of risk to the device. From there, security measures such as advanced challenge-and-response can be applied to confirm with high accuracy their legitimacy as a user. \nWhy is all of this so important now? When you consider the high percentage of bot generated traffic (over 50% by most estimated), it is clear that organizations need more advancement in botnet (malicious or otherwise) identification. Most of the major security threats such as application DDoS, brute force, and SQL injection are executed at least in part through botnets. Add to that the unnecessary and unproductive burden these botnets put onto transactional processing capacity and a very rich ROI can be defined for more successful and precise bot detection and blocking.\nIn an interesting twist, the use of device fingerprinting to identify potentially malicious devices has a “turning of the tables” element to it. After all, security and networking devices themselves have a definable fingerprint that has been used by some bad actors to clearly identify exactly what technologies are deployed within a network. With these network elements well defined, they can then target specific known or zero-day vulnerabilities for exploit.

Using rich mediation layer software, the Cyber Defense Network can be provisioned, configured and managed seamlessly across Carrier networks.   While fending off multi-vector security attacks, an SDN-based Cyber Defense Network can detect and mitigate in a way that scales without manual intervention.\n Like SDN, NFV aims to reduce OPEX while offering increased flexibility, especially in the area of application delivery control.   Carriers faced with skyrocketing network data consumption coupled with higher operating costs are looking for a long-term fix to their margin squeeze problem – namely, holistic solutions that help lower network total cost of ownership.  A panacea may arrive sooner than later, with the industry largely adopting NFV leadership efforts to standardize on commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware.\nCOTS hardware with the capability of running advanced network functions software on it has the effect of reducing the “procure-design-integrate-deploy” repetitive cycle that most carriers face.  Taking it a step further, network automation is a key enabler for operational simplification.  Automation requires the integration of network functions with cloud/virtualization orchestration.  Putting it all together, the potential gains of NFV include reduced OPEX and CAPEX, reduce power usage, greater flexibility in assigning Virtual Network Functions to hardware, and rapid service innovation.\nTogether, SDN and NFV are poised to change the business model for Carriers. These technologies yield a formidable business and technological blend, bringing forth a promise to create for Carriers the following overall benefits:\n\nMore intelligent application delivery and security deployments\nSimpler implementations\nLower solution costs\nHigher scalability\nEasier and abstracted operation\n\nThis translates to smarter networks and a smarter business.  For more information on Radware solutions, come see us exhibit and speak at the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Vancouver in May.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'carrier\', \'NFV\', \'SDN\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/05/leveraging-sdn-and-nfv/');

One side is the good path and the other side is the bad path. However, you don’t know which one is which and both paths are guarded by identical twins. One guard tells the truth and the other, always tells lies. If you want to take the good path, what should you ask the guards? You would ask “which path would your brother go?” Then, take the path opposite from where they are pointing.\n\nWhat does this have to do with hybrid cloud web application firewall (WAF)?  Well, this is very analogous to the selection of cloud security WAF options available today.\nThe truth today is that the industry has come upon a fork in the road.  One path is the good path; the other is the bad path.  Let’s illustrate why and provide you with the proper questions to ask so you can know the difference between these paths.\nWhy is Hybrid Cloud WAF So Compelling?\nSomething profound has been occurring recently which has accelerated a tipping point – the migration of business applications to non-premise or off-premise cloud providers.  The likes of IBM and others robustly declared at the InterConnect Conference this year that the cloud can no longer be categorized  as  private or public – but instead has shifted to a hybrid state.\nTo remain competitive and relevant, every business must transform and adapt.  Radware’s new whitepaper examines three major reasons behind the idea of cloud being synonymous with “hybrid”:\n1. Most companies will retain some internal application delivery infrastructure\nMost businesses simply aren’t positioned to move all legacy applications to the cloud. Starting a hybrid cloud approach does not require a complete migration of traditional IT infrastructure to a public or private cloud.\n2. Dedicated infrastructures are a luxury\nThis will make most companies uncompetitive vis-à-vis hybrid competitors.  The verdict is in about the merits of virtualization and cloud in that it unleashes hidden efficiencies which were often elusive to classic data centers in the past.  At its core, cloud was designed to take the complexity of virtualization away from the end user and fully enable self-provisioning and speed to service delivery.\n3. Information Security and Compliance\nFrom the inception of cloud delivery models, security has provided the anchor to adoption because of concerns of inadequacies. In the end, most companies who are “cloud-ifying” applications from more traditional deployments found themselves with fewer options and features in which to secure applications in the cloud.\nThe task of keeping a business up and available while orchestrating various cloud delivery service models is non-trivial.  Similar to the change of just-in-time inventory in manufacturing models, the cloud, with all its cost and agility benefits, ushered in a whole new era of requiring a high degree of uptime. The issue of uptime is multi-faceted.  There is a need to cover numerous categories of security threats such as volumetric vs. non-volumetric attacks, bots vs. humans, multi-vector attack campaigns and web exhaustion techniques.\nCurrent Challenges with Cloud WAF in Hybrid Environments\nCurrent technology shifts have changed business leaders’ expectations of IT and disrupted many of the security models we’ve come to expect.  These changes have resulted in complications for security professionals dealing with different operating environments and also a loss of visibility to the overall ‘business’ picture.  Businesses are now looking for IT to respond in hours or even minutes compared to what used to be days or weeks.  Organizations need to have the ability to detect threats with high quality in one location and react to those revelations in all operating environments in real time, and then orchestrate changes to the affected systems quickly and universally.\nToday no single web application firewall technology exists which addresses these problems.  Solutions offered by security vendors today do not include a web application firewall that covers both on premise and cloud protection.  This lack of integration between on premise and cloud protection leads to limited visibility in the attacks and attackers on your network.  Organizations cannot differentiate attacks that occur in the cloud from attacks on premise.  Was it the same vulnerability?  Was it the same perpetrator in both attacks?  These questions simply cannot be answered because your quality of detection is limited. Organizations need to be able to mitigate a security problem on premise and in the cloud.\n\nThe need to secure applications on premise, in the cloud, and during the transition period from on premise to the cloud requires a hybrid solution that allows simple policy migration from the premise to the cloud to support seamless migration process without exposing the newly migrated applications to web attacks.\nRadware Hybrid Cloud WAF\nToday Radware introduces a Hybrid Cloud WAF Service that provides a fully managed and always-on, cloud-based web application firewall service.  It’s the industry’s first hybrid-based cloud WAF service with integrated CPE and cloud WAF technologies and it is a single vendor solution, with fully integrated management and reporting that protects both cloud-based and on premise applications.\nUnmatched Web Application Protection provides full and unparalleled protection from web application-based attacks and is the only WAF in the cloud that provides full coverage from the OWASP top – 10 attacks. It is ICSA Labs certified, supports both negative and positive security models and the unique ability to generate policies automatically.\nFully Managed Security Services include 24×7 support, proactive log review and analysis, system monitoring and auto policy generation. The service is backed by Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) – a dedicated group of security experts that actively monitor and mitigate attacks in real time.\nAn Easy, Flexible Model offered in a simple, OPEX-based model with 3 packages to choose from (Silver, Gold & Platinum).  It’s simple to setup with no deployment process or download/install items needed.\nAlways-On DDoS Protection includes anti-DDoS behavioral analysis and IPS protection from network and application downtime, application vulnerability exploitation, malware spread, network anomalies, information theft and other emerging cyber-attacks.\nNow, let’s return back to the riddle which started this discussion.\nYou are walking down a path and there is a fork in the road. One side is the good path and the other side is the bad path, however you don’t know which one is which.  My suggestion is to always choose the most thorough security coverage – that will keep you covered for any path.\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'Hybrid\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/04/hybrid-cloud-waf-protection/');

Because of these technologies, we  are able to move between our favorite blog site, news center, or social media  site (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) without having to struggle for log in  information. \n\n FIM is the organizational and contractual arrangement that separate  entities use to allow shared or in-common users to leverage a common identity  to access their services. They must agree on who owns the identities, what  privileges are allowed to be passed, how they will interact as an asserting  party (the one that receives the first authentication request and validates  it), the relying party (the one that receives the authentication validity  assertion), and the back end authentication protocols as well as liability  issues for misuse or mis-authentication and a few other contractual issues.\n SSO is the capability of using a  single identity and password to access desired/permitted resources. This is  generally done within an organization but can also be used within a FIM  construct between organizations.\n The most obvious benefit is low  user friction. This is the largest single driver for implementation from the  user perspective. Once authenticated to the asserting party, the user has  nothing else they need do to access the various resources within not only that  identity realm, but in any associated or relying realm.\nThe most significant security  issue is based upon the same situation, full access to all of the users’  entitlements with one identity. Once an attacker is in, everything associated  with that single identity is accessible so there are no gates or controls  stopping total take over or compromise.\n I first began working with SSO at  the enterprise level back in 2004. The IT team assigned to the project was ahead  of their time; they were able to glue together access between Microsoft Active  Directory (AD), third party applications for Microsoft and even elements of the  Linux environments that IT managed. In ’04 this was pretty cool and cutting  edge. Those not involved in the leading edge project expected a high level of  interoperability, but had no idea of the combination of technical artistry and  Frankenstein-ian patchwork required on the back side to synchronize the  identities across the environments and pass authentication between applications  that weren’t designed for SSO.\n Now, zoom forward to 2015…\n Microsoft has expanded its SSO so  it not only works with all (99%) of the applications in a local environment,  email, shared infrastructure resources, and SharePoint but it also operates  between forests and other shared trust implementations in Microsoft and  non-Microsoft environments without the need for cobbling. It doesn’t stop  there. They have created a SSO authentication so identities that are maintained  with the local AD can be used to access organizational resources from the  Internet and access Microsoft owned, customer assigned infrastructure and  resources across the globe including Windows Azure, and Office 365.\n This is done using a model  similar to Kerberos, where credentials are not passed in the clear during the  authentication process and once authenticated, the user maintains a token  provided by the authentication server that is presented to the resources (s)he  attempts to access and validated by the system responsible for authenticating  access to that resource.  As previously  mentioned, this is a boon for usability with users benefiting from years of  research and development. However, there are still security configurations and  concerns that need to be managed.\n Since a “single” server is  responsible for access, some form of redundancy should be followed, clustering,  master-slave, multiple physical locations, etc. It should also have a back-up  set up in case of corruption or other unexpected failure/disaster.\n The SSO server itself contains a  master secret that is shared with the other services it has authority for so  that server and key store must be protected.   Proper access controls, firewalls and activity monitoring are  crucial.  It should also be a standalone  installation meaning that the system should not support any applications or  additional services not requiring the SSO as those increase the attack surface  of the system making risk of compromise greater.\n Organizations also need to ensure  that local system and application administrator accounts are treated as equally  sensitive as domain administrator accounts.\n The SSO authentication service  account and SSO administrator accounts should be unique for their purpose, not  shared accounts or accounts used for other purposes so they can be easily  isolated and identified as itself for logging and troubleshooting.  It also helps to compartmentalize sensitive  functions in case of compromise.\n Users should understand the scope  of impact their accounts can have if credentials are shared or  compromised.  As mentioned earlier, with  compromised SSO accounts, the attacker has unfettered access to all resources  the user had.  \n This makes user security  awareness paramount.  \n\nUsers need training on how to avoid phishing  attacks and how to surf the Internet safely.   Such attacks can subject them to malware embedded in a requested  download (Trojan horse) or a drive-by download (malicious content from a web  page that downloads without user request as part of the visited page).  \nUsers should also refrain from downloading  content from sites they have no knowledge of.   Compromise of the user identity or system with the identity token on it  means attackers have access to everything the user does.  The malicious activity can appear to be  coming from the user putting their livelihood and reputation in jeopardy.  \n\nSSO and FIM are great tools but  also deserve a level of user respect that they do not yet receive.  This mostly comes from an out-of-sight,  out-of-mind situation with the users.   Users need to understand that they have access to information that  someone wants and is willing to break the law to get without remorse or  likelihood of getting caught leaving him or her holding the [broken] bag and  having to pick up the pieces.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Data Protection\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/04/security-before-you-sign/');

More recently there has been a lot of discussion about the  value of an overlay SDN model vs. an underlay SDN model and the role of  specialized hardware in either model. All of these discussions are important  and they all are focused on key architectural characteristics of SDN.\n\n In  my experience architectural discussions begin very early in the adoption cycle of  a new technology or architecture. When we get closer to a technology or  architecture crossing the chasm and being broadly adopted, we begin to see more  of a discussion of operational considerations. The discussion of the  operational impact of SDN is happening now as many organizations that are  evaluating or trialing SDN are trying to answer a critical question:Â  Does SDN make providing security easier or  does it introduce a host of new security challenges.\nThe 2015 Guide to  SDN and NFV contains recent market research that shows that 35% of  network organizations believe that SDN will enable them to implement more  effective security functionality.Â  One example of how SDN can enhance security is that security services can be implemented based  on using OpenFlow-based access switches to filter packets as they enter the network.Â   Another example is that role-based access can be implemented by  deploying a role-based resource allocation application that leverages the  control information and capability of the SDN controller. Other security  related use cases include leveraging the control information and the capability  of the SDN controller to provide DDoS protection.\nMarket research from the 2015 Guide also shows that 12% of network  organizations believe that concerns about possible security vulnerabilities is  a significant inhibitor to SDN deployment. Some of the security challenges  related to SDN are described in SDN Security Considerations in the Data  Center.Â  \nAs pointed out in that document:\n\nThe centralized controller emerges as a  potential single point of attack and failure that must be protected from  threats. \nThe southbound interface between the controller  and underlying networking devices is vulnerable to threats that could degrade  the availability, performance, and integrity of the network. \nThe underlying network infrastructure must be  capable of enduring occasional periods where the SDN controller is unavailable,  yet ensure that any new flows will be synchronized once the devices resume  communications with the controller.\n\n\n Other security-related considerations for IT organizations:\n\nImplement  measures to deal with possible control flow saturation attacks; i.e.,  controller DDOS attacks;\nHarden the  SDN controllerâs operating system to ensure availability of the controller  function;\nImplement  effective authentication and authorization procedures that govern operator  access to the controller. \n\nSo does SDN  make providing security easier or does it introduce a host of new security  challenges? Â The answer to those questions  is yes – SDN has the potential to make providing security easier and at the  same time, it has the potential to introduce new security challenges.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'NFV\', \'SDN\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/04/security-and-sdn-deployment/');

I’d like  to expand on that topic and discuss how organizations are affected by  non-volumetric DDoS attacks and what they can do to recover. \n\n Volumetric DDoS is the big boy on the field or as I call it –  the bully of Internet attacks. It gets the majority of the attention and when  aimed at someone’s Internet presence it lumbers in and then bludgeons the  services and infrastructure into submission. Without the proper preparation on  the part of the target, the bullying and intimidation lasts until either the  attacker runs out of money to pay for the service or the target company meets  the demands.\n However, volumetric DDoS are only one facet of DDoS and the  other types can be even more difficult respond to and to detect. Volumetric attacks  are often detected fairly rapidly because of their size and collateral damage,  but resource starvation and application level attacks are normally lower key.  They often start out well below the radar unless advanced DDoS technology is  deployed or specific systems and application monitoring are in place.\n In the case of a resource starvation attack, the goal is  usually to attack the hosting system via service calls to the Internet Protocol  (IP) stack like tcp-syn requests. Calls to the underlying operating system or  authentication system are also used to tie up processes, memory, and IP ports  until the system cannot accept or respond to any more requests for  connections.  To win at this game, the  attacker must have done some basic reconnaissance to know what operating system  is being run. \nApplication-based DDoS attacks perform a similar function but  focus not on the network or operating system stack, but on a specific target  application. The attacker will present a wide variety of bogus data inputs to  forms, attack login screens with bogus credentials and find any other  interfaces for the application to throw data at. The goal is to both affect the  application, the application server and/or the back end database. To do this  well, the attacker has to have done some reconnaissance and know more about  these components making this more of a precision attack than the others.  \nAs the bully, volumetric attacks are designed to make a big  show to get attention, but both resource and application DDoS attacks are often  much smaller than volumetric attacks because they are targeted. The goal of the  latter two is often not to take the system out of commission, but to use the  attack to actually compromise the system to create a foothold in the network  for the attacker. Though volumetric attacks are often used in conjunction with  the resource and application attacks to draw attention from the compromise or  data extraction, there is no requirement to do so.\n The defense for resource and application-level attacks  requires a significantly higher level of precision than volumetric filtering. Volumetric  attacks are very often leveraged as a front for the others because to an  untrained eye or less effective defense system, resource and application  attacks look like real traffic so they are often passed through to their target  which is great for the attacker. \n To be successful the DDoS filtering defense must be system  and application aware and preferably integrated with the DDoS volumetric  filtering to facilitate a feedback system between them. Without that feedback  the problem becomes almost a chicken and an egg scenario.  Which comes first? IF volumetric response is  first it has to be configured very loosely to try to ensure that all of the  good traffic gets through for filtering by resource and application filters. This  will most likely not only reduce the efficacy of the volumetric scrubbing but  it is bound to still drop some desired traffic and add significant load on the  latter two scrubbers.  Placing resource  and application scrubbers in front of the volumetric scrubbers is a no starter.\n DDoS is a technology problem and requires a strong technology  solution. If you are going to come through DDoS unscathed you will need not  only a strong technology partner but a strong incident response program.  Choose wisely on both counts.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'attack mitigation\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/03/protect-beyond-volumetric-attacks/');

Most WAFs make claims of comprehensive protections, however, either through fault or folly this doesn’t meet reality.  Many solutions water down their deployments and make capitulations on the resulting configurations.  The devices may also lack in raw technical protection, equating to a device analogous to an IPS in protecting against a network DDoS attack – ineffective, but purported to secure against such attacks.\nNGFWs Fall Short on Encrypted OWASP & DDoS\nCurrent Next Generation Fire Walls (NGFWs) seem to perform poorly when it comes to performance and SSL/TLS inspection, according to a report by NSS on the loss of performance.\nWhile NGFW tend to protect one vector of an encrypted threat, such as intrusions or vulnerabilities, the NGFW themselves are vulnerable to an SSL/TLS encrypted application DDoS attack. Some of the proposed protection and mitigation measures suggested are performing application layer request rate limiting from a source, such as deploying scripts on an ADC, or a reverse proxy, etc.\nThe Real Demon is the BotNet!\nThe current environment is rife with a variety of BotNets (which can be for hire on the black market and can be paid for with stolen credit cards for a relative pittance) which may consist of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of hijacked home and personal computers on broadband connections that can be commanded and will respond by targeting a destination for attack. These are known in the security parlance as Zombies. The threatscape has changed with respect to the floods and some basic protection sets by ISPs are effective, such as detecting high traffic volume over extended period of time. But BotNets can be commanded to be randomly bursty or individually generate low volume, this can equate to a large BotNet bringing a significant flood towards an attack target. Most of the HTTPS floods do not need to generate a high volume of traffic towards a destination, just a high amount of SSL/TLS handshakes per second, and a high number of requests per sec. In most of the enterprises, applications can be brought down by a few hundred requests per second, let alone thousands, hundreds of thousands, or worse.\nIs Malware Infiltrating Your Workstations and Causing Data Exfiltration via SSL?\nNow let’s look at the threats which can piggyback the content from external websites being browsed by employees in an enterprise/entity.  Most of the SSL/TLS visibility tools rely on decryption of traffic, which is not an issue if the protected server belongs to the enterprise and private keys are available. However, it is an issue if the entity to be protected is not the enterprise server, but workstations, as the servers are located externally to the enterprise, and such private keys are not available – for example access to the private keys of Gmail or Yahoo Mail.  By the very nature of SSL/TLS this cannot be made available, this after all is one of the cornerstone of SSL/TLS security.\nHow Do We Overcome These Challenges?\nThe challenges that are present in server security are diverse and Radware is in a unique position today in the market, being the sole vendor that can mitigate the threats targeted towards a data center, such as encrypted application floods via HTTPS (in addition to the garden variety HTTP floods, and various DNS, NTP, UDP floods and amplification attacks).  These solutions also have the ability to provide visibility into the SSL/TLS traffic destined to external websites.  This means that the majority of server-targeted attacks can be mitigated by a combination of OS patching, configuration, and IPS signatures, as well as standard DDoS mitigation mechanisms.  One step further is providing an integrated system comprised of modules such as Network Behavioral Analysis, IPS and Packet Anomaly prevention as the Attack Mitigation System (AMS).\nWhat Sets Radware Apart?\nHTTPS Floods\nWhat sets Radware apart is the ability of the solution to not only defend against such attacks, while permitting legitimate traffic to pass through without degradation, latency, or throttling (unlike rate limiting), it can also very uniquely defend against SSL/TLS application floods, without impacting legitimate traffic by leveraging the innovative Defense SSL component of the AMS solution. The Defense SSL is protected by US Patent # 8,832,831.\nMalware Infiltration and Data Exfiltration via HTTPS\nThe Radware Client Side SSL/TLS inspection, allows us to function as a mediating SSL/TLS proxy for outbound content and provides for a decrypted active stream of traffic, which can be inspected, intercepted and permitted or denied by security tools such as Malware Inspection tools, DLP appliances, and various policy enforcement tools guarding content posted to social media sites as per regulatory requirements. The solution is highly scalable and can intercept traffic from hundreds of thousands of enterprise workstations.  Radware’s Client Side SSL Inspection is protected by US Patent #7,769,994.\nIn order to combat the variety of threats that proliferate today within the SSL/TLS sphere, Radware provides a comprehensive solution that addresses the mitigation of HTTPS DDoS attacks, and provides selective visibility into SSL/TLS encrypted traffic for content inspection, policy enforcement, and regulatory compliance requirements.\nThese unique solutions deliver high performance and low latency, and have a very cost effective TCO. They offer the ability to scale horizontally in incremental fashion, without having to rip and replace and the augmentation of capacity is transparent, with little to no impact on the service infrastructure.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'ddos\', \'security\', \'SSL\', \'TLS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/03/security-concerns-ssl-tls/');

Â As a result, organizations found that they needed to deploy premise-based technologies for true comprehensive DDoS attack mitigation and detection.\nToday at Radware, weâre introducing a new commercial-grade attack mitigation platform that offers our customers the widest range of simultaneous cyberattack protection in the industry.Â  With up to 300Gbps of mitigation capacity, the DefenseProÂ® x4420 seamlessly integrates into the Radware family of products.Â  The powerful new design also addresses todayâs most tenacious volumetric DDoS attacks (like UDP reflection attacks, Â fragmented IP floods, and out-of-state floods) while at the same time can pick out and mitigate sophisticated non-volume threats, which often lurk below the surface in multi-vectored attacks.\nAs the industryâs first dedicated attack mitigation platform to offer 100Gb interfaces, the Radware DefenseProÂ® x4420 can handle 230 million packets per second of attack traffic.Â  This platform was designed for multi-tenant environments and it is able to support up to 1,000 active policies which includes separate processing capabilities, customized management and reporting per tenant.\n\nThe DefenseProÂ® x4420, part of the Radware Attack Mitigation System (AMS), provides service and cloud hosting providers better value for their investment and eliminates the need to deploy multiple devices.Â  In fact, we have seen that businesses that have deployed Radware AMS on premise in conjunction with DDoS protection by the service provider were able to survive and maintain their business operations in spite of large scale, large volume multi-vulnerability attack campaigns. Â When AMS is deployed on both sides (on premise and at the service provider) they achieved the best protection when properly managed and maintained.\nCommercial accounts, such as cloud providers and the mobile carrier market, are constant attack targets.

If you were to ask your CDN provider to block those 250,000 hacked routers, how many of them might actually be your customer?  If you based your defense on IP block lists, you’d potentially be blocking your own legitimate customers.  Can a cloud or CDN detect and differentiate whether the requests coming through their network are legitimate users or their weaponized router?\nOur customers share with us the pain of their challenges and we’ve had to create new and innovate ways to deal with these issues.  CDNs can be very beneficial to the online experience and effectively improve speed and performance issues.  The importance of performance should not be understated.  It is a force that can affect user experience, search page rank, conversion rate and revenue.  You have choices in the defense and performance of your network and a well thought out strategy can and should deliver the best of both.\nRead more about how CDNs are being used for attacks:\nCDNs as a Weapon for DDoS\nLesson Learned:  ISPs & CDNs Aren’t Enough for Anti-DDoS\nUsing Spreadsheets as a DDoS Weapon\nMore Bots and Aggressive API Abuse\nIs Your Home Network Haunted?

New experiences and the evolution of everything around us can’t help but cause us to reconsider past ideas and outlooks. It is a truism of life that extends into many areas, including the way we look at IT.\n\nThe perspectives on how best to address cyber security threats have gone through their own evolution. Headlines suggest that in the case of a threat like DDoS the challenge is simply having enough capacity to handle volumetric attacks. We know from experience that it just isn’t that simple. What’s needed to solve the problem of DDoS is based on three core characteristics of attacks:  number of vectors, volume of attack, and finally, duration of attack. Escalations of all three present their own unique challenges, and the best approach will be one that balances a focus on preparation and response.\nEach characteristic is also something we monitor and explore across a number of inputs, included in our annual Global Application & Network Security report. This year we surveyed over 300 information security practitioners and this yielded some especially interesting results around attack duration, a couple of which I’ll highlight here.\n\nFirst, we found a troubling dynamic between the percentage of attacks lasting over a day, and respondents stated ability to mitigate for a day or more. According to the survey, nearly half of attacks are lasting a day or longer. Yet, when asked about their ability to effectively fight around-the-clock attacks, over half (52%) indicated their abilities would end after 24 hours. This disparity of requirements and capabilities highlights a broader issue: the difficulty of building and maintaining internal security operations teams that can reasonably be expected to keep up with the fast-moving threat landscape.\nThis challenge also plays right into another compelling take-away. In past years, we’ve seen a relatively small percentage of respondents say they operate in a state of constant attack. That number jumped threefold from 2013 to 2014, with now nearly 20% of respondents indicating they are under constant attack.\nThis shift is significant. Most security teams have as a pillar of their operation, the notion of incident response and management – built on the premise that attacks have a starting point, an end point, and then a series of processes to assess and remediate.  The common phases of incident or emergency response from identification, containment, eradication, recovery and policy adjustment takes on a very different look when it occurs as more of a rolling and never-ending process.\n\nAnd how exactly can we expect the teams asked to manage these incident response processes to do this work while they are often the very same resources running triage on whatever is the newest attack to target the organization. Not surprisingly, many of the organizations indicating a state of constant attack are from the verticals with the longest history of cyber threats. But we now know for a fact, that attacks target every imaginable industry. No one is immune and it is reasonable to assume that the constant attack reality could spread to other industries.\nHow You Can Manage\nWithout a doubt, dealing with a state of constant attack will represent an important progression for security teams. Here are some areas that these teams can focus initial efforts in order to manage an almost unmanageable volume and complexity of threats:\nUnderstand the threat landscape\nHaving a team well versed in the variety of attacks (vectors, targets, tactics, etc.) will help triage in situations when some threat must go initially unaddressed, and also help teams predict attacks that may be a harbinger of more severe threats to come.\nPrioritize assets, applications, and processes\nKnow well the network-dependent aspects of the business that cannot afford to have interrupted operations and have contingency plans to keep these operations afloat during attack.\nAssume the attacks are coming\nThere are so few businesses that haven’t been targeted, that the “head in the sand” phenomenon is quickly going away. This is good because an assumption you won’t be attacked is playing right into the hands of the malicious actors. Advanced security teams assume the opposite (that they will be attacked) to force disciplined planning processes.\nCoordinate with peers on the business side\nStakeholders within the business often have unrealistic expectation about balancing protection and network-enablement. Work with them so they understand the realities of the threats and come to an agreement on the absolutely essential elements of the businesses network.\nProactively seek help\nEven if you’re not ready to pull the trigger on bringing in outside support to protect from certain threats, do the research in advance to have a sense of exactly where you’ll turn when the worst happens.\nClick here to download the full 2015 Global Application & Network Security Report\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/02/age-of-constant-attack/');

Obama Calls for Public/Private Sector Cyber-Security Collaboration', 'Ben Desjardins', '2015-2-19', 'Last Friday, President Obama continued his efforts of  advancing cyber-security as a national priority. In a speech at Stanford  University in the heart of Silicon Valley, the President emphasized the  importance of collaboration between the public and private sectors to an  audience of students, consumer-oriented companies, and representatives of the  technology sector.\n \nThe focus is unsurprising for at least two reasons:\n\n\nConsider his audience: this is a group from whom  Obama has struggled to get consistent support and participation in  cyber-security initiatives; and \n\n\nResponding to criticism: the President took a  lot of flak for earlier speeches on cyber-security due to their (over)emphasis  on post-event notification to consumers\n\n\nAt the heart of Obama’s pitch was the  Cyber Security Framework, a two-year in the making effort of the National  Institute of Standards for Technology (NIST) initiated by the February 2013  Executive Order 13636, calling for improved protection of Critical  Infrastructure from cyber-security threats. The Framework itself is a sound  tool for driving some consistency of approach across public and private  organizations for the assessment and remedy of unacceptable levels of risk. But  it is (as its name suggests) only a framework;  the success of using it to advance cyber-security posture depends entirely on  the depth and accuracy of implementation, for which organizations are generally  on their own. It’s a bit like a personal trainer providing a workout plan with  limited customization and no actual monitoring of the workout. How many of  those Russian twists will most of us do without the personal trainer barking  encouragement over our shoulder?\n Another element of the Framework, and really the major point  of the President’s speech last week, is the necessity of information sharing  between public and private companies. The President is on the right track in  pushing more information sharing related to cyber-security incidents. The work  of existing information sharing centers, such as the Financial Services  Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), has been a high point in the  government involvement in cyber-security advancement. However, the proposals to  enforce this sharing legislatively, faces significant head winds, both within  Congress and at the private sector level. Both groups will likely keep a  careful eye on the response of privacy advocates before going all in on these  proposals.\n\nThe President also stated that the government “often has the  latest information on these new threats.” This statement could suggest that  this is not intended to be a one-way sharing model and the private sector will  benefit from information from the government as much as the government will  benefit from access to private sector data.   There is truth to this statement and the government does indeed have  resources to offer.  Even if in many  cases, the resources are private sector companies working under contract to the  U.S. government to gather and analyze threat intelligence. Personally, I’d  prefer to see more focus on the development of information sharing and analysis  in other industries (there are others beyond the FS-ISAC) and the addition of well-defined  plans.\nThe President was successful in garnering some support in conjunction  with Friday’s speech — when frankly many companies don’t have a lot to gain by  publicly backing the proposals.  Apple  CEO, Tim Cook, gave an impassioned speech on privacy and civil rights,  seemingly looking to counter-balance the potential negative impact of Apple’s  support of the Framework.  Other organizations  heavily focused on consumers (American Express, Kaiser Permanente, AIG among  them) also showed support, mainly by stating their commitment to following the  Framework. Some of the strongest commitments came from technology vendors like HP and Symantec, who have already announced plans for information sharing. \nThe Framework itself lays out a very basic level of  processes and protections that most sophisticated security organization have  long ago exceeded. Supporting the President here could represent a low-risk  opportunity for these private sector companies. The information sharing order  is another beast entirely, and not surprisingly it is being backed largely by  vendors in the security space that possess internally managed (or partnership  based) sharing and analysis capabilities. If the only real traction we see out  of this is small groups of technology vendors sharing information, this could  result in driving up proprietary products and services.  A risk that could essentially make backward  progress in the endeavor of having more organizations turn the Framework into  actual improvements in security.\nSo, what now lies ahead for the President’s proposal? It’s  hard to say, and equally hard to define a next step to call the program a  success. There is little dispute over the fact that legislation will never be  able to keep up with the  pace of emerging threats.  Unfortunately,  at the end of the day, encouraging organizations to follow a solid but  high-level framework to increase information sharing accomplishes little. Finding  ways to make government more relevant to the execution of cyber-security operations  – that could leave a legacy of impact on this growing issue.  \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'Cyber Security\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/02/obama-calls-for-publicprivate-sector-cyber-security-collaboration/');

This is certainly true of load balancing (LB) as well as application delivery control (ADC), which has undergone virtualization and software programmability/orchestration evolutions.\n\nOne related initiative that is getting steady attention is Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS). At its most basic, the idea behind LBaaS is to provide load-balancing functionality via software so it can be programmed and added to orchestration via APIs. This is the same basic mechanism of all automated, software-defined approaches across the spectrum of cloudification, from software-defined networking (SDN) to software-defined storage, and even software-defined data centers (SDDC).  As such, LBaaS could just as well be called “software-defined load balancing.”\nLBaaS is also related to network function virtualization (NFV), in this case network functions associated with load balancers/ADCs. Both rely on virtualization and programmability, but LBaaS is a higher-level service concept, which may (or may not) be implemented using NFV.\nMany of the driving forces around the industry wide LBaaS initiative have centered on the OpenStack community, which launched LBaaS Version 1.0 in 2013 as a branch of the Neutron networking working group. That first version included the most basic of load balancing capabilities and established a basic instantiation sequence: Create a pool; create one or several members in the pool; create one or several health monitors; associate the health monitors with the pool; and create a VIP that is associated with the pool. This was useful for demonstration projects and for lightweight internal cloud usage, but it wasn’t meant to be an enterprise-class or carrier-grade alternative to a full-blown industrial ADC.\nLBaaS Version 2.0, which is coming as part of the Kilo release of OpenStack (1H 2015), adds much more substantial capabilities, including SSL/TLS termination, support for TLS SNI, and Layer 7 content switching. Additional objectives include TLS client certificates, TLS back-end encryption, UDP support, and Layer 7 content modification. Accomplishing this required non-trivial redesign of the LBaaS architecture, along with Neutron extensions such as the ability to store TLS certifications in the Neutron database. LBaaS v2.0 provides the richness that is needed to meet carrier-grade and cloud operator requirements, in terms of high availability and scalability. For example, the Octavia project aims to provide a reference implementation that is worthy of direct use by cloud operators.\n\nRadware was one of the first independent ADC vendors to embrace LBaaS, in part because it was the first to have fully virtualized its ADC solution, via the Alteon VA product. As part of its Virtual Application Delivery Infrastructure (VADI) strategy, Radware had also already productized and proven an orchestration API and plug-in, known as vDirect. These steps made adapting to support the OpenStack Neutron LBaaS extensions quite straightforward, and Radware has maintained an active presence in the Neutron LBaaS working groups. Other ADC vendors have followed, providing their own driver plug-ins to Neutron LBaaS, and thus allowing OpenStack to deliver on the promise of vendor independence.\nBut OpenStack isn’t the only game in town. LBaaS is a concept that is relevant to any cloud environment. While OpenStack is gaining momentum, the majority of currently fielded and operational clouds are based on alternative open or proprietary technologies, such as VMware vCloud Director, VMware NSX, Apache CloudStack, or Amazon Web Services (AWS). Recognizing the mixed nature of demand, Radware’s LBaaS solution is, for example, supporting VMware vCloud Director and HP Helion in addition to OpenStack Neutron. Over time, the real test of success for LBaaS solutions will be how consistently LBaaS features are supported across multi-cloud environments and how effectively more advanced ADC/LB features can added in an automated, orchestrated fashion.\nOther questions are facing the LBaaS working groups within OpenStack, such as whether to remain within OpenStack or to disconnect themselves and form their own open community. Regardless of how all that plays out, LBaaS is here to stay, and its continued evolution should be of benefit to the broader cloud community, including cloud providers, cloud administrators, and cloud users.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'Cloud\', \'LBaaS\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2015/02/lbaas-load-balancing-for-the-age-of-cloud/');

The Threats of the Ghost Vulnerability and the IoT', 'David Hobbs', '2015-2-5', 'Recent vulnerabilities have  surfaced that have opened up interesting debates and spirited discussions  regarding what I see as vulnerabilities in embedded Linux systems.  Devices that are considered part of the “Internet  of Things” (IoT) have embedded Linux and this can make it fairly easy for hackers  to compromise home networks.    \n\nFor  the IoT to work, it needs to connect to your wireless network at home.  This is how you can unlock your front door,  power on your lights, engage your security system, or even change the ambient  temperature in your home from virtually anywhere in the world. The IoT can help  manage your household in many ways all through a few swipes on your mobile  device – from unlocking your front door for a contractor or babysitter to  engaging interior and exterior lights while you’re on vacation.  Unfortunately, however, hackers have the  potential to override your home system – and it’s easier than you think. \n Turning  a blind eye towards robust password combinations for home wireless routers, there  are some users who create the simplest of passwords, keep the manufacturer’s default  settings or don’t create a password at all. By doing so, the homeowner is  asking for trouble. Even for the less experienced hacker, a few minutes of  guesswork can grant them easy access.    \n Once  in, a quick configuration change can allow the hacker to place an infected  version of Open-WRT onto the router.    Open-WRT is a Linux distribution for embedded systems with a fully writeable  file system.   After a quick reboot, the infected Open-WRT  now connects to a command and control server (or a list of places) and the homeowner  is none the wiser. The hacker can now start advertising that infected router as  any one of the access points in the neighborhood.  \n\n  With  a few keystrokes, they can spoof the name of someone else’s access point and  that owner will think they are connecting to their own network, but it is  really the infected router.  This occurs  when the infected Wi-Fi router beacons out “De-Authorization” packets to a computer  until the user connects to the infected router. This well-known exploit can be  accomplished through various off-the-shelf devices and pen testing kits.\n When  computers are connecting to an infected access point, a hacker can harvest the  password for your Wi-Fi from your authorization request, and now the infected  router can connect as a “repeater” to your Wi-Fi router and exploit it through  available vulnerabilities such as “Shellshock” or “GHOST” which is a buffer  overflow bug (glibc – getbyhostname). Or, they can use a password cracking tool  to guess the password. \n So what do hackers do with  all of these infected home routers? \n\nHarvest botnets for DDoS attacks\nInfect home computers with malware, etc. \nTake advantage of what you access on your personal laptop:  bank/financial information, shopping, medical  records.\n\nIf  you were to ask your immediate family members “when was the last time you  patched your home router?” what do you think the answer will be? \n By  2020, industry statistics state there will be over 200 billion “things”  connected to the Internet. I was shocked by this number – until I did an inventory  of all the things that are connected in my own home. After counting the modem,  firewall, Wi-Fi router, tablets, computers, “smart” devices like thermostats,  etc. I found that I had 27 things that were connected to my network. Granted,  I’ve had to patch everything multiple times this year and also run a Unified Threat  Management platform at home, but who else has done this?  \nThere will be patches for  all of the vulnerable systems out there, but how many home users update and  patch their routers? \n  Keeping  ahead of hackers is similar to a chess match. When we make a move, they counter  with their own move. I believe the rise of the army of  thingbots is going to grow exponentially in 2015, but by no means should this turn into a  digital apocalypse.

Integrating this ACI fabric with the Radware Alteon Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and DefensePro solutions drives this value even  further through enabling automated tenant-based application delivery and  security services.\n\nHow  does it work?\nHere  at Radware, we’ve developed device packages for the Cisco ACI.  These packages enable users to insert ADC and  DoS protection services per application and/or per network tenant.  The Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure  Controller (APIC) automates the service insertion process while acting as a  central point of policy control.\nWhat’s in  it for you?\n  You can now increase your data center’s  agility without compromising application service level agreements (SLAs).  \n\nDeploying Cisco ACI as a dynamic and automated  datacenter infrastructure will continuously deliver applications without any  adverse application SLA impact.\nYour applications can move, scale-up, or  scale-out while retaining the associated L4-7 and security services without any  location-specific constraints.\nError-free deployment thanks to automated  processes running Radware-certified use cases.\n\nHow it  has been used:  Web Application Service  Profile Use Case\nUsing Cisco APIC a user can automate the creation  and provisioning of a web application profile. Cisco APIC offers a  drag-and-drop user interface to easily insert a firewall, load balancer and  other L4-L7 network services into a web application profile. This, in turn,  creates a service graph in which a L4-L7 service such as load-balancing,  becomes an integral part of the tenant’s web application and can become  operational by APIC in minutes.\nBest of breed application delivery and  DoS Protection services are necessary to protect your data center and your  application SLAs in today’s atmosphere of growing threats.  Choosing a vendor you can rely on, will  maintain your SLAs as well as eliminate any ‘noisy neighbor’ impacts that can  occur from a traffic increase of non-critical applications.  The Alteon NG is the only load balancer that  guarantees application SLA for all web, cloud and mobile applications and the Attack Mitigation Service (which includes DefensePro) offers the most  accurate real-time DoS/DDoS attack detection and mitigation without blocking  legitimate user traffic.  The bottom line  is that you can drive greater value  from your Cisco ACI deployment with the integration of Radware application  delivery and DoS protection services.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'application delivery\', \'availability\', \'Cisco\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/01/application-centric-services-cisco-aci-and-radware/');

But  even without the preview, the comments on cyber-security were rather  predictable (and brief). \n\n Cyber security threats and their potential impact on organizations  and individuals have become a mainstream issue in the past year and they represent  a “safe” platform for public officials. Few would argue against the need for  increased protection of businesses and consumers alike.\n But some significant questions remain . . . how well are the  issues and challenges of cyber security understood by those leading the  discussion? With a complex array of threats and targets, where should increased  legislation or regulation focus? And will the organizations (public and  commercial) be prepared to implement the new requirements?\nLet’s start with the last question first. Will the  organizations likely to be impacted by the introduction of new regulations  around cyber-security be ready, willing, and able to implement them? Well,  there is at least one data point that suggests a strong willingness, and even  desire, to do so. \n This past fall, we conducted a survey of IT and information  security professionals to gain a better understanding of what organizations  are doing in response to an increase in regulatory changes and guidelines  regarding application and network security. The findings reveal some  interesting attitudes relative to increased government regulation. While  acknowledging that the increase will adversely impact their organizations  financially, the vast majority of respondents believe more regulatory guidance  is needed.\n\n \"84% expected network & applications security to be more tightly regulated by the government over the next 12 months\"\n\"63% of respondents indicated a willingness to adopt application & network security best practices from another industry\"\n*From a 2014 survey of IT and Information security professionals.Research conducted by Radware and IDG Research.\nIn an area where regulators are accustomed to organizations  fighting new requirements tooth-and-nail, this attitude should be refreshing  and signal strong opportunity. Again, this is another indicator that proposing  stronger guidelines for cyber-security represents a “can’t lose” platform for  the President and other lawmakers.\nDespite the apparent support for increased regulation, all  is not smooth sailing for the President’s proposals. Criticism from the corners  of commercial and public sectors emerged quickly after the ideas were previewed.  The most significant criticism has been that there are no truly new ideas in  the President’s proposal. Indeed, the proposal includes elements that have been  in play for some time, as evidenced by blog  post from 2011 that covered some of the same ideas.\n None the less, there are some legitimate issues with the  scope of the proposals, most notably their tendency to seek treatment of the symptoms  rather than the root cause. Nearly all of the President’s grandstanding on  cyber-security leading up to the State of the Union focused on the issue of  consumer notification in the event of an incident. No doubt, this is an  important topic . . . but the proposals lack an in-depth focus on prevention of consumer data breach in  the first place.\n Reading between the lines of responses to our survey last  year, one can see a real need for more consistency and guidance for  organizations that genuinely want to improve cyber-security. For any of the  President’s proposed measures to take effect, organizations will need strong  models for information sharing, data protection, and network availability.  Fortunately, there are some strong models out there. \n\nThe Financial Services Information Sharing and  Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) has set a strong standard in the area of threat  intelligence sharing between organizations. Started in 1999 as a result of  President Clinton’s Presidential Directive 63, the FS-ISAC today unites global  members in a collaborative effort around new vulnerabilities and threats  targeting the banking industry. The processes and resources used to build the  FS-ISAC could and should act as a guide for other industries now faced with  broader requirements for information sharing.\n\n\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC) provided another point of guidance.Â  In statements issued in April of last year  pertaining to DDoS attacks, the FFIEC offered 6 specific steps to integrate  DDoS preparation into an organization’s security planning.Â  Admittedly this is really high level and  really more of a “plan to make a plan.”\n\nThese are just two examples; there are many others. For a  more complete view of recent cyber-security regulatory measures, check  out Carl Herberger’s blog from last May that spotlights 6 specific  initiatives.\n Gaining expertise and education are key steps for businesses  to take when starting to address the inevitable cyber-security regulations that  will occur this year.Â  Using trusted,  experienced vendors can provide access to the knowledge and technology that can  defend against current threats as well as detect and prevent potential threats.Â  I invite you to download the full research on how new cyber security  federal regulations are impacting application and network security to gain  a better understanding of what organizations are doing in response to federal  guidelines, how those changes are being perceived and also how some businesses  are changing their own protocols to stay complaint.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'Cyber security regulations\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/01/obamas-cyber-security-proposals/');

DDoS are the big,  fat, scary bully of the Internet. When organizations have sufficiently tight  security or a would-be attacker doesn’t have the skills to overcome a target’s  security, he or she can buy capacity on a bot-net or other delivery vehicle and  slam packets from all over the world at the target’s site and application(s).\n\n Without the proper protections,  the target is at the mercy of the attacker and his or her budget. However, with  the proper protections, the target, now defender, has the opportunity to  respond quickly and ride out the storm. The issue is, what are the proper  protections? That depends a little on what type of DDoS the target experiences.  There are several types of DDoS attacks including volumetric, resource  starvation, and application. (For more description on these types of attacks,  see my previous Radware guest blog here.)\n\n In this blog, I want to focus on  a technique that has been maturing in recent years, providing excellent results  for DDoS defenders. The technique is referred to as “Application Signaling,” “Cloud  Signaling,” or in some cases just “Signaling.” The nomenclature variations are  primarily vendor-driven for product or service differentiation but work to  deliver the same end result: better DDoS mitigation.\n This feature or service is a key  step in the evolution of DDoS protection because it is the early warning  system. For organizations that have a fully cloud-based scrubbing solution that  monitors all of their traffic continually, they can respond quickly and can be  very effective, but also very costly. The more traffic you generate, the more traffic  they monitor, and the more expensive it can be. On the other side of the  equation, if a defender is using an all on-premises solution, even if the  solution can handle the scrubbing, most likely the DDoS will congest  communications, Internet, and connection between the ISP/service provider and  their data center to the point that service is affected anyway. The other issue  is engaging a service provider to begin scrubbing can be fraught with delays,  further exacerbating the business, customer, and revenue impacts.\n\nSignaling is a means to efficiently  bridge an on-premises data center protection solution to a cloud-based  scrubbing center. Signaling is used to accelerate response timing and  effectiveness helping to ensure the availability of data center infrastructures  and applications during DDoS attacks.\n\n To provide the best signaling intelligence between the  site and the cloud the defense systems must share key information such as:\n\nHealth information of internet link capacity (% utilization)\nHealth information of information security & critical IT assets  themselves (% CPU)\nCurrent Attack Information   (Type, Bandwidth, Telemetry)\nCurrent Effective / Ineffective Defense(s) (e.g. signatures,  challenges, etc.)\n\n\nEach of these pieces of data are  crucial intelligence for optimizing scrubbing of the attack packets while  optimizing receipt of the desired business information.\n Today, volumetric DDoS attacks can  be detected by operations staff, but they still take time. Most times when  attacks occur, systems and application administrators start by troubleshooting  the system or application that appears to be having trouble, and after they work  their way back they determine that the problem is a DDoS. This takes time and  delays resolution. With signaling enabled, the DDoS defense systems in the data  center identifies the attack much faster and can be configured to either alert  the operators or automatically trigger a signal to the infrastructure of their  service provider’s network to activate and mitigate the attack. A volumetric  DDoS attack would be significantly diminished or removed altogether from the  data center’s access links, restoring service well before administrators could  troubleshoot and manually isolate the problem.\n Application and resource  starvation DDoS attacks attempt to degrade the Internet-facing applications and  their supporting processing, database, and distributed storage components. In  the most insidious cases, resource and application-level attacks may cause an  application server to stop processing new requests because all of its open  ports are engaged waiting for client data. This stops real customer requests  from being processed. By creating a simple feedback loop that connects the  premises to the cloud service center, defenders can stop targeted application  attacks.\n Because bot-nets can be rented relatively  cheaply to deliver a large amount of traffic to the target, the economies of  scale for DDoS are on the side of the attacker. Using signaling to accelerate  response and provide clean traffic with minimal service impact and reduced  ongoing data loss begins to move the indicator away from the attacker. If the  defender feels little to no impact of a funded DDoS attack, the attackers will  not see the value and find another means to their ends.\n Radware  offers these defensive capabilities by integrating its cloud scrubbing center  with its on-premises solutions, thus  accelerating comprehensive detection and mitigation of all forms of DDoS  attacks.  \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cloud Security\', \'ddos\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2015/01/right-way-to-secure-applications/');

On December 22, the New York Times reported that this  summer’s breach at JP Morgan Chase was the result of a single server that got overlooked  in a system-wide upgrade of security. Such an oversight is not entirely  uncommon for vast enterprises managing tens-of-thousands of assets as part of  their corporate network. Unfortunately, this instance resulted in a point of  entry for what at the time looked like a contender for the “cyber-attack of  2014,” a title now firmly in the grips of the Sony incident. Still, the JP  Morgan incident is important, not only due to its scope but also the underlying  risks it highlights. \n The New York Times story includes a detailed description of  the exploit according to “people who have been briefed on internal and external  investigations into the attack.” Naturally, the breach wasn’t as simple as an  intrusion event on a single server. The origin of the compromise was the theft  of legitimate login credentials from a JP Morgan employee, which in and of  itself could have been managed had the overlooked server been upgraded with  two-factor authentication along with the rest of the corporate network. \n The apparent tenacity of the attackers to seek out and  exploit this server should come as no surprise. Testing a wide array of  network-facing assets until finding the vulnerable weak link is a clear trend,  as evidenced in our 2014-2015  Global Application & Network Security Report published last month.  Consider the graphic below, which shows how a  number of different technologies and layers of the network become frequent  targets, with attackers often jumping from asset-to-asset until they find one  they can knock over. \n\nFurther evidence of attacker tenacity can be seen in the  growth in duration of attacks. Based on our survey results, 19% of attacks are  now “constant” . . . this is a more than 300% from previous years. Troubling  too is the fact that nearly half (48%) of attacks last more than one day, yet  only 52% of respondents reported the ability to defend against attacks for more  than one day. \n \nAnother trend evident in this year’s report is the continued  migration of Enterprise IT into the cloud. While the JP Morgan incident wasn’t  reported to be related to use of cloud services, exploits like this can  reasonably be expected to increase as more IT assets and sensitive data leave  the corporate network.\n Much of the adoption from the enterprise market will  undoubtedly focus on hybrid cloud deployments, a leveraging of dedicated  (single tenant) cloud-based systems working in conjunction with public Internet  elements and assets. Such deployments do have clear security advantages over  pure public cloud deployments leveraging multi-tenancy. But in the end they  still put the reliance of security in the hands of a service provider. Considering  the situation at JP Morgan, where you’ve got large, sophisticated IT and security  operations overlooking the security of a network-facing asset, one shudders to  think of the potential loss of control.\n Organizations adopting cloud computing and “as-a-service”  models need to be diligent about understanding the security capabilities of  their vendors. Enterprises need to also consider the potential for becoming the  virtual “collateral damage” of an attack targeting other customers of the  service providers they use. \n Radware works with number of cloud service providers to help  them manage secure environments, and offer their customers added layers of  security to their hosted applications. It is important to explore not just the  advertised security services enabled by a hosting provider, but also the  underlying technology they are using to deliver security. \n What are your company’s plans for adoption of private and  hybrid cloud services and how are you adapting your security policies to  account for the loss of direct control?\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'data breach\', \'ddos\', \'Hackers\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/12/attackers-are-winning-the-race-to-find-the-weakest-link-an-update-on-the-jp-morgan-data-breach/');

This was cited  by about 15% of the survey respondents. However, 19% of the major attacks  reported were considered “constant” by the targeted organization.  That’s a stark contrast from the 2011, 2012  and 2013 surveys.  While organizations  reported many weeklong and even month-long attacks, never have more than 6%  reported experiencing constant attacks. \nThis trend challenges the traditional  concept of incident response, which assumes a normal state without attacks.  It also exposes a security gap.  When respondents were asked how long they  could effectively fight an around-the-clock attack campaign, 52% said they  could fight for only a day or less!\n\nNew Trends are Changing the Rules of the Game\nThree trends have become  incredibly disruptive to information security:  the continued migration to cloud (and the accompanying  dissolution of enterprise IT), the rise in the Internet of Things (IoT), and  the move toward the software-defined network (SDN). \nHybrid Solutions Prove Themselves and Gain Ground \nThis year, more than a third  (36%) of Security Industry Survey respondents indicated that they use a hybrid  solution with both customer premise equipment (CPE) and cloud solutions.  Another 6% plan to implement. Interestingly,  responses suggest that by 2015, nearly half (48%) of those surveyed will employ  hybrid protection. \nInternet Pipe, Reflective Attacks Earn Dubious Honors\nNot only has it increased as  a point of failure, but the Internet Pipe now has the “honor” of being the  number-one failure point.  Meanwhile, hackers  seem to be making their way through every protocol to determine whether and how  to use it for the next big reflective attack. The result:  Reflective attacks represent the single  largest DDoS “headache” of the last year.\nHeadless Browsers, DDoS Attacks Become More  Sophisticated\nAttackers are now combining  multiple techniques in a single attack—enabling them to bypass defense lines,  exploit server-side vulnerabilities, and strain server-side resources.  Such attacks include Anonymization and Masquerading, Fragmentation, Encryption, Dynamic  Parameters, Evasion and Encoding, Parameter Pollution and Extensive  Functionality Abuse.  \nBudgets Can Be Challenging—But Organizations Are  Investing\nOrganizations of all sizes  are struggling to finance and anticipate costs associated with cyber-attack  prevention and mitigation. When asked how their organization has deployed  resources in response to cyber threats in the past 12 months, more than half of  the respondents reported changing security process, protocols and/or mandates.  Nearly half said they had invested in new or  specialized technologies. \n\nThis year’s report  illuminates how security attacks are more complex, even as macro-IT trends contribute  to the dissolution of security effectiveness.  Research confirms that the motives, means, and  effectiveness of security attacks are on the rise – and it also highlights the  need for greater agility to quickly adapt to evolving threats. \nIn addition to results survey, expert analysis and data visualization,  the report also includes a checklist that can be used for evaluating your  preparedness for attack detection and mitigation capability.  This tool should prove valuable in assessing  your attack resiliency.\nYou can download this  informative 53-page report by clicking here.

As attacks are typically launched during busy  periods when organizations are already stretched for resources, relying on  manual detection can put the availability of your servers and applications at  risk during an attack.  High-quality,  automatic detection is critical – it gives you the coverage you need without  relying on manual resources.  Remember,  you can only protect against what you can detect.\n\nHave an Expert Security  Team On Hand, Ready To Respond\n  Activate your  in-house team if you have one and contact your vendor’s emergency response team  as well.  Radware’s Emergency Response Team is  staffed by experts that have vast knowledge and experience with network threats  and can provide instantaneous, expert security assistance in order to restore  network and service operational status.\nCommunicate Early and  Often with Customers and Partners, And Also Your Employees\n  Identify a spokesperson for media inquiries.  Make sure messaging is coordinated across all  external communications channels and keep those channels updated on a regular  basis during an attack.\nLearn and Improve\n Once things settle down, go back through the response  process to identify areas for improvements in your tools, processes and  resources. Make sure to follow up with customers for damage control and to  re-establish relationships.\nWhile you can’t stop hackers from launching an attack, you  can ensure that your defenses are robust enough to withstand such attacks and provide  a positive experience for your customers.   This is true every day of the year but even more so during this busy  holiday period, so both businesses and consumers can enjoy a safer online  experience and a fruitful shopping season.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the different approaches  to stop DDOS Attacks, visit  here to download a free whitepaper.  This paper is a great  resource for organizations that need to guarantee the availability of their online  services and want to learn how to stop future attacks.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Attack Detection\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'ERT\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/11/protect-your-retail-business-from-cyber-attacks/');

Â In  fact, a case can be made that cyber-attacks are not just a powerful option for  perpetrators, but they have risen to become a desirable weapon in their caches.\n\n A weapon is right.Â  A routine  choice for hacktivists, cyber-attacks seek to leverage the impact of conflicts  and social protests. Â A recent example of  this is the Anonymous group joining the Occupy Wall Street protesters by launching  attacks on major financial institutions in New York.Â  Other attacks, like those on Sony® and other  companies affiliated with the copyright industry, have also been used as revenge  as part of Operation Mega-Upload.\n In an era where cyber-attacks have become a main-stream and permanent  tactic in perpetrating cyber-crime, social protests, and cyber war,  organizations need to implement a security solution which can overcome a litany  of emerging risks.\n Join my upcoming seminar \"The Art of Cyber War\" at  Black Hat on November 25th as we analyze why recent cyber-attacks became so  successful and also what layers of defense are required for your business to  survive.Â  \n Here’s an invite to register (in  Portuguese) and a preview of the defense layers we’ll cover:\n\nThe Perimeter Layer â The need for a set of  security modules that include Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection, Network  Behavioral Analysis (NBA), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and Reputation  Information.\n\n\nApplication Layer Security Risk Management\n\n\nApplication or Transaction Layer â This layer of  security is defined at the ‘transaction-oriented’ or application-layer. It  covers numerous areas of concern and in this layer the complexity of detection  and mitigation rises and the need for premise-based technology becomes  paramount.\n\n\nCloud Layer â The next layer of defense is  defined at the ‘volume threat’ and is based in the cloud. Attackers flood the  victim with a high volume of packets, consuming networking equipment resources  or bandwidth resources.\n\n\nPeople Layer â Possessing knowledgeable and  specialized security experts who provide 24×7 instantaneous service to restore  operational network and service status for customers facing DDoS attacks.\n\nCompanies that rely solely on ‘one-size-fits-all’  in-the-cloud managed security or an on premise security solution often cannot  withstand coordinated attack campaigns.Â   Attackers are patient and persistent and can leverage multiple attack  techniques like low & slow attacks.Â   These same attackers also use evasion techniques to avoid detection and  mitigation such as SSL-based attacks or changing the page request in a HTTP  page flood attack.Â  If there is one  permeating, unending lesson learned on how to survive cyber-attacks, it is that  modern day security teams need to be agile and crafty in combatting  attacks.Â  Solutions that include a hybrid  security approach offer the most comprehensive protection against all kinds of  attacks.Â  \n I look forward to sharing more attack types and attack prevention  tips at Black Hat during this seminar and also at Radware Booth #240.Â  Stop by and see our team!\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'ddos\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/11/art-of-cyber-war-at-black-hat/');

Places like the dark web exist in the form of trading houses with stolen personal information from credit cards and social security numbers, to health records and full identities being obtained for a price. Malware development and deployment and other attack services such as DDoS and botnets can be rented by the hour. Recent reports indicate that DDoS attacks are increasing in both frequency and size, and the problem of botnets being used as attack networks or launch points in DDoS and other malicious activities is significant. Indications are that it will only continue to get worse.\n\n We are looking at a new age of botnets. The first age was servers, PCs, and laptops.  The second age was mobile devices such as smartphones, phablets, and tablets. What’s the newest wave? …  Thingbots. \nWhat is a Thingbot?\n Thingbots are devices born from the Internet of Things (IoT) like wearables, remotely-managed environmental devices (such as HVAC systems), Internet-connected industrial systems, and even the Coke machine at the movie theater you just went to.  Wireless medical devices from radio-controlled insulin pumps to remotely manageable pacemakers, like former US Vice President Dick Cheney’s, and new classes of devices from network connected smart cars to anything that individuals create for personal use in their homes are all Thingbots that can either be attacked or used as attack platforms.\nHow Do Thingbots Work?\n Each of these devices connects to the Internet in some manner and runs code on a microprocessor to do something.  There are little to no quality standards or code checking for IoT-enabled devices. A hacker can compromise and inject malware into them, bringing them under his or her control just like PC’s and phones. This presents a huge number of security risks and related concerns.\n\nWhat is the Risk?\n According to recent reports by IDC and Business Insider, the estimated number of IoT-connected devices is between 14-20 billion, with nearly 2 billion of those being IoT class devices. This volume is expected to grow to an estimated 32 billion total connected devices by 2020 with approximately 9 billion IoT devices. Now the really scary part:  few to any of those devices have antivirus or advanced endpoint and threat detection on them. They are ripe for the picking.\n We already have a problem with compromised devices, despite having had prevention and detection technology in place for years. Systems are already being used to steal billions of records and disrupt Internet communications and other commercial services. Now we have whole new waves and classes of devices which have no on-device protection. What happens when we add these IoT devices to the mix is a critical concern for a number of research organizations. Refrigerators and televisions can send spam and even our toasters and microwaves can be leveraged to create DDoS attacks against a faraway target, or even against one’s own household. Each of these devices has some level of capability to allow hackers to influence and gain knowledge about our lives. Compromised devices can share what our cameras see, change our environmental controls, and affect our very lives by changing settings on our medical devices. \nWhat Can You Do?\n What is the consumer or manufacturer liability if a mundane IoT device is used against another location to perform a DDoS or if it is used to execute a life threatening attack on another individual? The size of the impact on our lives and society is yet to be seen, but it can be extreme depending upon how much we connect and how well we manage it. Managing the risk involves managing awareness. Be aware of how much you want to share and also how much may be shared through the different ways you connect doing everything you can to restrict access and availability of these devices.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Botnets\', \'ddos\', \'information security\', \'IoT\', \'thingbots\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/11/rise-of-thingbots/');

I wanted to take some time to share some powerful reminders of how diligence in approach is needed.\n Organizations that used to rely on their service provider’s DDoS protection service (in-the-cloud) found that the attacks that hit their business could and would bypass the provider’s protection layer.Â  This is because DDoS is a tactic, not the overall problem.Â  Attacks borne from the Internet are the problem and solutions designed to handle a simple tactic, wind up falling short.\n\n What was realized by many organizations was that they needed to deploy premise-based technologies for comprehensive attack detection and mitigation.Â  In fact, our security researchers have seen that businesses which deploy on premise protection, in conjunction with DDoS protection from their service provider, are better able to survive and maintain their business operations, in spite of large scale, large volume, multi-vulnerability attack campaigns. Â When deployed on both sides (on premise and through the service provider), businesses achieve the best protection when properly managed and maintained.\n Over the past few months, here at Radware we have been deploying with wide acceptance a new concept in cyber-attack mitigation, simply called the Attack Mitigation Service. Â Radware Attack Mitigation Service delivers the following solution benefits:\nIt is easy to deploy and maintain (fully outsourced).\nIt is comprehensive technology.\n\nAttack Mitigation Service is the only solution that can truly protect against all type of DDoS attacks including volumetric DDoS flood attacks, application flood attacks, SSL based attacks, and low & slow DoS attacks.\nEnd-to-end deployment of Attack Mitigation Service is the best solution to fight the DDoS threat at all layers, mitigating all attack vectors in seconds.\nWhen deployed on-premises, the online business has full control of its security solution and can be assisted by the Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) when attack mitigation expertise is required.\n\nThere are easy procurement options.Â  \n\nAttack Mitigation Service offers the lowest cost OpEx and CapEx solution to fight cyber-attacks and can be delivered either in a low monthly charge or on an annual basis.\n\nSuperior panoramic visibility leads to world class compliance and reporting.Â  \n\nLet Radware do the hard work in demonstrating compliance and cyber-attack effectiveness and leave your IT security and management to focus on more business-oriented activities\n\n\n There have been some reoccurring issues when handling and deploying hybrid solutions.Â  There is complexity in managing the technology and the various vendors and many businesses report that they struggle to provide comprehensive and integrated reports.Â  Sticker shock is also an issue because there is usually little, if any, pricing flexibility.\n Attack Mitigation Service is designed to address these issues in one simple, easy to procure solution which is both comprehensive and fully managed by the technology vendor (e.g. outsourced).Â  Recently, I received the following accolade from a customer who launched our new Attack Mitigation Service.Â  \n“Radware provides us with a worry-free, fully-managed, hybrid solution with the widest protection coverage and flexible payment options.  Supported by their industry leading Emergency Response Team, the combination of these benefits gives us a piece of mind that our network is well protected from today’s known and unknown attacks.” \n Tarun Samtani is an  information security specialist for Ebuyer.com, and like so many, his company was facing DDoS attacks on a weekly basis and he realized the prevalence and finality of such attacks.Â  Whether for regulatory, client or operational reasons, no online business or organization in today’s business climate can ignore the omnipresence of cyber-attacks and the challenges associated with fighting them.Â  Attackers are getting sophisticated and can launch complex attack campaigns which can complicate detection and mitigation algorithms.Â  This also can create the unending need for talent and staffing.\n We are happy to report that acceptance of this new solution has been broad, including many geographical regions in APAC, EMEA & the Americas.Â  The adoption has also been pervasive and we have reached diverse industries such as transportation and logistics, finance (in nearly all micro-segments), gaming, global and local retailers, technology providers and managers, and healthcare organizations.\n As this service continues to grow we look forward to discussing how you too may enjoy the benefits of this world-class technology combined with the wisest and most crafty cyber-warriors/defenders in the world! \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'cybersecurity\', \'ddos\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/11/easy-button-for-cyber-attack-mitigation/');

Les Assises is the largest information-security gathering in France and year-in and year-out it proves to be not only a huge information sharing opportunity, but also a time of self-reflection and strategy affirmation for the thousands of security executives that attend. \nThe conference was brimming with a bursting-at-the-seams attendance and a full dance-card of top notch speakers and engaging topics to review.  I learned a lot from those with whom I had the good fortune to hear and speak with – and I now better understand that our industry is at a crossroad.\n\n\nHere are some of the most resounding messages I’d heard:\n\n\nThe threat landscape is changing with great velocity.  There is no ‘set it and forget it’ any longer in the mindset of the people who bear the brunt of detecting and mitigating today’s threats.\n\n\nEurope is inextricably tied to the international information-security community.  There was a great sense to me that the attendees understood that although organizations in France didn’t always receive the size or type of cyber-attacks which affect the US, there was clearly a sense of urgency and reverberation into the European theater to proactively deploy controls before the attacks reach their ‘shores.’\n\n\nThere is a growing sense that governments need to take action and begin legislating priorities and providing guidance for their companies and organizations.\n\n\nPerhaps a few years behind organizations in the US, there is, never-the-less, a quick movement to Cloud Delivery Models – making permanent the porous perimeter.\n\n\nIn addition to these conversations and joining the Radware team in attendance, I was invited to provide a presentation on the topic of Cyber Warfare.\nBuilding a Yellow Brick Road\n As part of my visit, I was asked to build a “yellow brick road” – to assist participants in their pursuit of a more stable and predictable path through the threat malaise.\n My presentation highlighted many myths about today’s cyber-attacks that many believe, such “a cyber-attack is just about volumetric attacks and all you need to do is ‘buckle down’ to weather a storm that will eventually pass.”  I also tried to drive some salient points about how folly the idea of not planning and studying this threat has proven to be!\n I concluded my discussion by summarizing key points about enterprise security, among them is that cyber-attack storms shouldn’t be weathered alone.  \nThe following criteria should be considered when conducting an assessment of how capable your organization’s protection is:\n\n\nQuality of Attack Detection:   Do you have accurate and effective protection against all vectors of attacks?\n\n\nTime-To-Detect:  Speedy attack mitigation.  Many vendors actually take a lot of time.\n\n\nTime-to-Mitigate:  This includes the time to detect and to react effectively; a very important parameter.  Only the best service providers achieve client satisfaction in this area. \n\n\nQuality-of-Mitigation:  Make certain that legitimate traffic is not suffering while mitigation is occurring.\n\n\nDetailed Reporting & Response: Today, even large enterprises don’t have the expertise and resources to handle large scale and prolonged attack campaigns.  Small to large online businesses require an ‘Easy Button’ too – that is a system that provides total end-to-end service for the entire threat spectrum.\n\n\nIn my time spent at Les Assises this year, we learned that attacks are becoming more and more business relevant and in the past three years the frequency and complexity of attacks has grown.  Now it is easier than ever to tell who has gone down, who has stayed up, and who helped them along the way.  For me, the event highlighted poignantly powerful trends and proved to punctuate the omnipresent threat gripping businesses today.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber attacks\', \'ddos\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/10/les-assises-2014/');

This SSLv3 POODLE vulnerability can force a client to negotiate  SSLv3 instead of TLS and then carry out BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS)  attacks to obtain information from an encrypted stream.\nWhat Have We Learned?\nUnlike previous  vulnerabilities we’ve seen this past year that allowed a hacker to access a  server (Heartbleed and Shellshock), this new vulnerability targets clients.  POODLE affects SSLv3, which encrypts the data between a user’s browser and the  website they are accessing. \nAs web browsers can  use either SSL or TLS, this “man-in-the middle” attack can force a connection  to SSLv3, where a hacker can steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access  to a user’s web-based email, social networks and other websites. However, for a  hacker to do this they need to place themselves in between the user and  website.  A WiFi hotspot in a public area  such as an airport, shopping mall or café is a place that could be used to gain  access.\nAlthough SSLv3 is  used in older browsers and servers, this aging protocol is still seen as  problematic as SSLv3 is still widely supported.\nWhat We Recommend:\nAs for Data  interfaces, our recommendation is to disable SSLv3 to force clients to work  with TLS 1.x ciphers as much as possible. Disabling SSLv3 will prevent access  from legacy clients. \nFor Management  interface, the risk of exploiting this vulnerability is low since the  management traffic is usually isolated from the Data traffic and accessed by  trusted users. Nevertheless, limiting the HTTPs management traffic and using SSH  as an intermediate mitigation is also an option until a fix will be released.\nLong Range Thoughts\nThe recent vulnerabilities that have emerged highlight the  rise in integrity-based attacks that we see at the Radware ERT. These silent  and effective attacks are used to not only violate confidentiality, but are  also leveraged as stepping points to launch other attacks.  The immediate steps to take are to disable  SSLv3 and migrate to another viable security protocol, such as TLS or SSH.  As more vulnerabilities emerge, our team will  continue to take them one-by-one and share our evaluation and recommendations.  For more on the POODLE vulnerability, read  our full report here.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Cyber Security\', \'ERT\', \'Hacking\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/10/cve-2014-3566-poodle-a-new-vulnerability/');

Within a 48-hour  period two different targets in two different continents were targeted with  this new technique and have experienced very high attack volumes.\n\nAs a  background, a normal SYN packet is characterized with about 40-60 bytes per  packet.Â  The new attack type departs from  the typical make up of a SYN packet by transmitting very large packet sizes  which complicate and defeat many defense algorithms.Â  This new SYN-Flood is extremely different in  that it is characterized as being approximately 1000 bytes per packet in size  and its attack can hit an entire network range. Â \nAttacks  with these dimensions to them quickly consume bandwidth and thus far even these  modest timed attacks were witnessed experienced pulses of about 4-5Gbps in  attack traffic. This new type of attack has the ability to saturate the  internet pipe of its victim faster than most attack types we’ve witness  beforehand.Â  We have aptly named this new  volumetric flood “Tsunami SYN-Flood Attack.” \nWhat have we learned?\nWhat  makes this new attack interesting is we’ve found a new method in the wild that  carries a tsunami-like volumetric attack over the TCP protocol. Normally, when  a perpetrator was to pick a weapon for massive volume, they would need to  settle on a UDP-based algorithm as the stateless nature of this technology and  small sized packets are perfect for volumetric attacks such as DNS, NTP and  CHARGEN reflected floods. In this new case, attackers have designed a  volumetric attack based on TCP or stateful-protocols which can present a brand new  danger. This new danger is that Â with a  TCP volumetric flood on a web server, a victim will not be able to deploy  defenses similar to UDP-based attack to mitigate it. \nWhat we’re recommending?\nRadware’s  ERT recommends that organizations verify that their mitigation solution can  block the Tsunami SYN Flood Attack. Â Early detection is key and most typical  TCP-based SYN cookie-type protections are not effective. Here are a few key  areas to consider in this case:\n\n\nBehavioral  algorithms are key in both detecting and mitigating these threats. Not having  an early behavioral detection capability on premise will render the application  stack and most modern defenses useless against this new attack weapon.\n\n\nA  hybrid model of cloud and on-premise mitigation is the most effective and sound  solution. Since this is a volumetric attack which can have pulse  characteristics to it, a targeted victim will need fast and high quality  detection coordinated with cloud scrubbing mitigation capability to prevent  internet pipe saturation.\n\n\nAn  updated emergency response plan is key to dealing with security attacks when  they occur.Â  Make sure you have on in  place, that it’s updated and your team knows what they need to do when an  attack is detected.\n\n\nLong Range Thoughts\nThis is  the first that we’re seeing this new type of attack which we feel has the  potential for a new trend in DDoS attacks. One can surmise that the attacks  which were witnessed may have been “exploratory”, in order to “fine-tune” the  concept and evaluate the effectiveness of deployed defenses.Â Â  \nShould  you be interested in more information or to test the effectiveness of this new  type of SYN-flood please feel free to contact Radware’s ERT to see if your  deployed resources can handle such attack types.

News articles regularly report on major breaches and outages, but rarely, if ever, do we see the underlying ransom demands that are presented before a business is attacked.  The stand that organizations often take is that they do not negotiate with terrorists or pirates.  But this approach, while noble, can become costly to a business, some may lose everything.  \n\nThis year we learned the story of Code Spaces.  This company went out of business in 2014 due to taking the non-negotiation approach.  Their other crucial error?  Trusting their cloud provider to have them covered – this was fatal for their business.  What would you or your company do if you received a ransom letter demanding compensation?  What if those threatening you aren’t just looking to capture the flag and sell it back to you?  Let’s look at some hypothetical (but potentially real-world) scenarios:\n“Attention Business X:\nWe know you are hosted behind a CDN, and we know it costs you money to serve content.  We have decided that we will load content from your website, non-stop, across all of the nodes of the CDN using our botnets and other reflection mechanisms to raise your bill by $100,000 per month.  This will go on indefinitely unless you pay us $50,000.\nWe will take the payment in the form of BitCoin or Online Wire Service X.  Failure to meet our demands will result in a never ending campaign to run up your bill up until you start showing major losses from IT costs.”\nIf you were an online business, what do you do if you saw that letter?  Would you leave your CDN provider?\nA CDN provider is designed to serve content and charge you for it, but they do not guarantee your protection.  To repeat – your CDN provider does not guarantee your protection.  Our team has seen instances of customers receiving monthly bills in excess of $1.5 Million from their CDN provider because of this misunderstanding because they thought they were protected.\nThe above letter is different than most traditional ransom letters that either threaten a DDoS attack or a full breach of the systems.  A letter from a more traditional cyber-criminal looks more like this:\n“Dear Company X:\nWe have heard rumor that a large cyber army is in control of a 100,000 node botnet and intends to attack you this Friday.   We know that to respond to these kinds of threats, it may cost you $50,000-$100,000 to deal with this kind of attack.   We are willing to convince this cyber army not to attack you if you send us $20,000 in the form of Bitcoin today.”\nThe letter above was similar to what Feedly, the popular news aggregator application, received.  And as you may know from the news, the attackers were not successful in extorting the money.  Feedly, however, was offline for many days in a row and had major reputation damage following this incident.  Would you pay the ransom next time?\nOften people think about protecting themselves after the fact.  You can’t buy car insurance after an accident, so why consider insuring your safety only after a breach occurs.  The best course of action is to defend against cyber-attacks before they occur and this should include a hybrid defense solution, one that pairs on-premise and cloud mitigation.  Having a good defense in place ahead of time is necessary if you wish to stop attacks when they do happen.  Otherwise, you may find that paying ransom is an acceptable option that would minimize the damage to your business, despite the cost.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', 'None', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/09/can-your-business-meet-the-demands-of-cyber-ransom/');

These attacks are designed to disrupt operations and access sensitive information, becoming a constant threat, to not only those businesses but to the customers they serve.\n\nIn response to this threat, Federal and State bodies, such as the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS), have enacted measures and procedures to help strengthen cyber security for financial institutions. These guidelines are expectations that banks should have risk management programs to identify new and evolving threats to online accounts. Adjusting customer authentication, layering security and other controls are also considered appropriate responses to the changing levels of risk. \nKeeping a financial institution safe from cyber-attacks is a herculean task and, of course, comes at a price. To gain a better understanding of what organizations are doing in response to these regulatory changes and guidelines regarding application and network security, we surveyed over 200 IT professionals. Chief among them were CIO/CTOs representing the financial services industry with global annual sales of $5 billion or more.\nWhat did we learn?\nFour in ten respondents state that federal regulations adversely affect their bottom-line results. Both CAPEX and OPEX are taking a hit. Some respondents have made strategic changes, such as investing in new or specialized technologies or by changing security processes and protocols. Others have taken a more tactical approach by hiring internal and external resources and allocating additional budget. \nThe survey results were interesting, but none were more surprising than this: Â despite the impact of regulatory changes, respondents believe more can still be done. In fact, 4 in 5 respondents believe it is critical or very important for the federal government to impose stricter regulations around application and network security. In other words, even though their bottom-line is being impacted by federal regulations â they want more.Â  \nOther notable findings from our survey: \n\n84 percent expect network and applications security to be more tightly regulated by the government over the next 12 months\n63 percent of respondents indicated a willingness to adopt application and network security best practices from another industry\n35 percent expect the frequency of cyber-attacks in increase over the next year, while 44 percent anticipate the number of attacks to remain the same\n\nWhat can you take away from this survey? \nOne can surmise that IT professionals are okay with stricter regulations as it’s a justification for larger budgets. Cyber-attacks will remain a persistent threat to large organizations and the costs they could incur from proprietary information theft, sabotage or reputation damage outweigh the costs of compliance. Cyber security is a problem across the board – by sharing resources, learning from previous attacks and taking a proactive posture to help mitigate cyber-attacks, a strong defense is being put in place.\n\nBenjamin Franklin once said, “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.” So, to impart some useful wisdom, here are three simple, but effective techniques that every IT professional should have in their arsenal when facing the constant threat of cyber-attacks:Â  \n\n\nAssess the Situation: Â I was surprised to see there were companies in the survey that had no strategy in place against cyber-attacks. Are you proactively protecting yourself against all vectors of attacks? This DDoS Checklist will help you see if you are covering the cyber-attack threats facing your environment. It can help you to identify types of DDoS attacks, threats, targets and techniques.\n\n\nKnow and Address your Limitations: Â 54 percent of respondents from the survey rely on premise-based technologies to combat cyber-attacks and 21 percent leverage a cloud-based solution. Yet, only 28 percent are using a hybrid approach of the two. Understand that there are limitations to a cloud-based scrubbing solution. Not all network and security appliance solutions are created equal. True security necessitates data protection, system integrity and operational availability. Bolster your weaknesses by merging on-premise and cloud attack mitigation.\n\n\n\n\nStrength in Numbers: Â More than half of our respondents indicated that they are willing to adopt application and network security best practices from another industry. The Financial Services-Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) notifies its members when cyber-attacks occur and provides “authoritative information specifically designed to help protect critical systems and assets from physical and cyber security threats.” It is a global information sharing resource.\n\n\nPlease feel free to download “How New Cyber Security Federal Regulations Are Impacting Application and Network Security.” You’ll gain additional insights about the top strategic and tactical approaches to new regulations and guidelines and see how organizations will approach compliance with future guidelines and regulations.

Depending on where you sit and what your day job is, the task may seem dramatically different but it truly affects the entire organization. Stronger security is everyone’s issue and responsibility. Â \n#2: Detecting and mitigating threats cannot be addressed by a “one-size-fits-all” solution\nIt was clear that whether we were discussing data leakage, social engineering, cyber-attacks, malware, intrusions, DDoS, fraud, etc., not only was the problem distributed, but so was the answer/solution.\n#3:Â  Today’s solutions are momentary and fleeting in face of the macro-level trendsÂ  \nAs disheartening as this sounds, the things we need to accomplish today are similar to temporary scaffolding on a building at a construction site â it is important, but not permanent. Â This was very hard for many to hear, however, there were three macro-level trends which pervaded the conference which will be incredibly disruptive to most current security solutions and will make them less effective: \n\n\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) –Â  easily surpassing BYOD as the major concern\n\n\nMovement to Cloud Delivery Models â making permanent the porous perimeter\n\n\nVirtualization of Network Functions â SDN & NFV no longer make routing predictable\n\n\nIn the midst of these conversations I was invited to provide a presentation on the topic of Cyber Warfare. I discussed how today’s cyber-attacks are not just a nuisance or isolated simple events.Â  All too many subscribe to the notion that a cyber-attack is just about volumetric attacks and all you need to do is buckle down to weather a storm that will eventually pass. I also tried to drive some salient points on how not planning and studying this threat has proven to be foolish. \nFor the conclusion of my discussion, I summarize the points that cyber-attack storms shouldn’t be weathered alone.Â  The following criteria should be considered when conducting an assessment on the capabilities of one’s organization: \n\n\nQuality of Attack Detection:Â  Do you have accurate and effective protection against all vectors of attacks?\n\n\nTime-to-Detect: Speedy attack mitigation. Â Many vendors actually take a lot of time.\n\n\nTime-to-Mitigate: Â This includes the time to detect and to react effectively; a very important parameter. Â Only the best service providers achieve client satisfaction in this area.\n\n\nQuality of Mitigation: Â Make certain that legitimate traffic is not suffering while mitigation is occurring and vice-versa.\n\n\nDetailed Reporting & Response:Â  Today, even large enterprises don’t have the expertise and resources to handle large scale and prolonged attack campaigns. Small to large online businesses require an ‘easy button’ too â that is a system that provides total end-to-end service for the entire threat spectrum. \n\n\nAt this year’s AT&T Cyber Security Conference we learned that attacks are becoming more business relevant. Â In the past three years the frequency and complexity of attacks have grown and now it is easier than ever to tell who has gone down, who has stayed up, and who has helped them along the way. For me, the event poignantly highlighted powerful trends and proved to punctuate the omnipresent threat that grips businesses today. Â It was definitely a conference that was well worth attending. \nYou can click here to view a version of my presentation.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AT&T Cyber Security Conference\', \'attack mitigation\', \'IoT\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/09/att-cyber-security-conference/');

The pentesting tools used to compromise and exploit a phone system are  not very sophisticated (nor do they need to be) and can be learned in a matter  of hours or even minutes.  Some target  the VoIP protocols themselves, and others the administrative interfaces.  During some SIP honeypot research I conducted  (which I spoke about at DEF CON Skytalks this year), I discovered that 99% or  more of tools used have identifiable signatures and are not modified from their  original form. The goal of the compromise is to take over a voicemail user  account or VoIP credentials to enable multiple fraud types.  Once access is gained to a phone system, a  smart fraudster will wait until a night or weekend to generate their calls so  they have a greater chance of going unnoticed.\nA few of the top ways a fraudster can quickly make money  using a compromised phone system include:\n\n\nInternational  Revenue Sharing Fraud (IRSF) – Calls are generated to a Premium Rate  Service (PRS) number hosted by a provider in another country.  The provider may include IVR services that  will answer the incoming call so billing can take place.  For each call or minute generated, the terminating  provider charges the upstream carrier and shares some of the profit with the  fraudster (thus the term revenue sharing).  While PRS providers can be legitimate, there  are a number that are knowingly engaged in fraud.\n\n\nWholesale  Fraud / Toll Bypass – The business of connecting calls between foreign  destinations can be highly competitive.  Exchange  and wholesale providers that carry calls from one service provider to another  between countries compete on very small margins.  These providers offer their services in online  marketplaces, and attempt to profit by being the lowest cost provider to  specific markets.  A fraudster can use  this by offering a lower cost route than the competition. However, the route  they provide is actually a corporate phone system that has been compromised.  Similar to IRSF, the fraudster shares in a  profit of cents per minute, but other service providers are actually generating  the calls.  The fraudster has no overhead  since they are using someone else’s network.\n\n\nWangiri  or SMS SPAM – In Wangiri (ring once) and SMS SPAM the fraudster either  calls a phone and lets it ring once, or texts an enticing message to a  subscriber using caller-id spoofing. The subscriber either returns the missed  call or calls the number from the text message. For readers in North America,  remember that Caribbean destinations are included in the ten digit North  American numbering plan maintained by NANPA, the North American Numbering Plan  Administration.  Customers who return or  make these calls don’t realize that a ten digit number isn’t necessarily  in-country and can actually be terminated in the Caribbean at destinations such  as Barbados, Grenada or Montserrat.  The  call is actually to a premium rate destination.  While these two schemes can be conducted from  anywhere, having a compromised PBX to generate the calls provides the fraudster  with a level of protection and reduces their cost.\n\n\nHow can one minimize the potential risk of compromise, or  limit the exposure after a system has been compromised?  There are a few best practices:\n\n\nFollow vendor hardening guidelines, especially  those with regard to password controls, and protection of administrative  interfaces.  Don’t put an administrative  interface on the Internet.\n\nLimit or eliminate features that aren’t needed  such as call forwarding, voicemail callback, and dialing out from voicemail.\n\n\nBlock or limit international dialing to specific  countries where business is conducted with call routing plans and/or a pin for  international calls.\n\n\nUse a security appliance such as Radware’s DefensePro that  understands the SIP protocol to block invalid messages, known attack tools, and  attempts to crack SIP credentials.\n\n\nWatch for suspicious logs and calling patterns,  like voicemail boxes being locked out, a spike in inbound or outbound calls, or  a spike in calls to an auto-attendant number.\n\nTalk to your service provider about what fraud  prevention services they offer.  Many  have services they don’t market well, or that may seem expensive.  Compared to the potential fraud loss,  prevention services are worth it.\n\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'carrier\', \'fraud\', \'security\', \'Service Provider\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/09/beyond-free-calls/');

One can surmise that this was politically motivated by U.S. sanctions against the Russian government.  If you take a step back and look at the bigger picture, for every real world government action, there will be a cyber-reaction. This is the latest example of this trend and isn’t just a problem for Washington. We’ve seen this around the world. \n More than ever, our world seems wrought in strife and civil discontent: \nNation-State Oriented:\n\n\n Israel / Gaza \n Ukraine/Russia\n Syria (internal)\n Iraq (internal)\n\n\n\n\n Afghanistan (internal)\n Egypt (internal)\n Libya (internal)\n Somalia (internal)\n\n\n\n\n India / Pakistan\n Sudan (internal)\n China / Japan (South China Sea)\n\n\nEvent-Oriented:\n\n World Cup \n Ukraine Presidential Elections\n Ferguson, Missouri / Michael Brown Shooting Conflict\n\nWhat these events all have in common is that each conflict has included cyber-attack weapons and attacks. In other words, as mankind physically struggles with each other, there has been new outgrowth with corollary cyber techniques. Here are three examples: \nWorld Cup\n\n Real World Action: The Brazilian government spends billions on creating new stadiums and enhancing infrastructure in preparation of the estimated 500,000 soccer fans who travelled to Brazil this past June for the World Cup. \n\n\n Tension Creating Issue: As thousands of native Brazilians lived in poverty, tensions began to rise about the government spending on this sporting event while turning a blind eye to the need for schools, hospitals and addressing social economic issues.\n\n\n Cyber Reaction: The hacktivist group, Anonymous creates #OpWorldCup and #OpHackingCup to target not only the Brazilian government, but companies that sponsored the event.  Major consumer brands such as Adidas, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Emirates Airline were also targeted due to their involvement with this major sporting event.\n\nUkraine Elections\n\n Real World Action: Ukraine holds its Presidential Elections to elect a new president just three months after the previous president, Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in a coup.   \n\n\n Tension Creating Issue: President Yanukovych caused anger with many Ukrainians by refusing to take needed steps to bring the country closer to the European Union. This evolved into protests that escalated into the demand for a better government.\n\n\n Cyber Reaction: This past May, a group of pro-Russian hackers called “CyberBerkut” infiltrated the computers of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission deleting key files and installed malicious software.  Had this nefarious software remain undetected, it would have shown an incorrect winner of the presidential election, essentially putting a person in power who in actuality, received 1% of national votes.\n\nFerguson, Missouri\n\n Real World Action: In the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, MO, a police officer shot and killed an unarmed teenager during an altercation. \n\n\n Tension Creating Issue: With circumstances of the shooting highly disputed between two sides, massive protests and civil unrest prompting Missouri’s governor to mobilize State Police and the National Guard in Ferguson. This shooting has prompted citizens in major cities throughout the U.S. to start peaceful marches in their own city streets.  \n\n\n Cyber Reaction: Hacktivist group Anonymous crashed the city’s web servers which forced city officials to communicate by text and even urged citizens of Ferguson, Mo., to confront the police in the streets. \n\nSo, what’s the lesson to be learned here?\n\n Recognize that when strife hits – – so will a cyber-attack.\n Cyber-attacks will increase your costs and complications of some of the world’s oldest conflicts\n Due to association with a cause, an organization is much more likely to be drawn into a conflict, then not \n Immediate and direct actions are needed BEFORE an attack in order to successful navigate the risks\n\nThe events above are neither a definitive list nor are they ranked in any particular way.  This post is merely a very short compilation of some of the most covered, politically-motivated cyber-attacks that I’ve seen this year. While companies and institutions cannot predict how these political actions will impact their organizations, this shows the importance of having staff trained on the latest cyber-security risks, as well as participation in information-sharing organizations that can turn threats into actionable intel. In light of this recent attack on the financial community, it is recommend that all financial services companies exercise extreme care with their security postures over the near term.

Let’s take a look at their forecast and see where we stand now.\n\nSurge in critical infrastructure outages.  Advanced countries are more likely to experience widespread cyber-attack disruptions to services like power generation, water supply and first responder services.\n\nSomewhat TRUE.  The threat has been present, but fortunately security professionals have been able to mitigate this risk.  A recent article, citing research from the Ponemon Institute, said that critical infrastructure providers continue to be a favorite cyber attack target.  Their research found that “67% of the IT security executives surveyed at utility, oil and gas, energy and manufacturing companies report that they have experienced at least one security breach in the past 12 months.”  Energy companies are regularly under full out assaults.\n\nRise in cyber-hostage incidents.  Nefarious groups will take digital assets or services as hostages and commandeer these services until certain demands are met, financial and beyond.\n\nVery TRUE.  Attacks on Feedly, Meetup, Basecamp and Elance have all been publicized as having a ‘ransom’ element to them – – that is the attack would stop if the company paid a ransom.  DDoS Ransom attacks have become mainstream instead fleeting and infrequent.\n\nEncryption as a mass weapon.  Hackers will use encryption to obscure communication in which illegally-obtained sensitive information is sent outside of the organization. With a small portion of organizations decrypting outbound SSL encrypted messages, 2014 will see an increasing use of encrypted messages for malicious activities.\n\nTRUE.  Nothing speaks to encryption as a mass weapon more than CryptoLocker, a ransomware virus that may be disguised as  legitimate, but locks up the personal files on a computer and won’t release them unless you log on to a site a pay a fee.  As it pervades and draws a wake of destruction, it’s now understood that encryption is not all good.\n\nFirst-ever SDN attacks.  Lauded as a promising and positive business disruption, SDN will be exposed to some unique security vulnerabilities that the framework introduces such as disruption to control-plane communications. \n\nFALSE.  There has not been an SDN attack per se, but risks still loom.  I believe that by the end of 2014 we will see our first meaningful SDN vulnerability exploited.  Traditional network devices were autonomous, but the SDN controller is accessible by a variety of systems, which opens more doors for attackers to pounce.   SDN continues to evolve and the attacking profiles are being spawned.  \n\nAdoption of cyber attack laws.  Governments will begin the process of setting laws around cybersecurity, like dictating network traffic flows and the security levels at critical infrastructure companies.  Expect lawmakers to also provide rules on what constitutes acceptable Internet behavior.\n\nTRUE.  There have already been preliminary steps into adopting these laws and more practical guidelines will continue to evolve.  An earlier blog that I’d written also offers a snapshot of DDoS regulations that have occurred recently. \n\nThe world has settled into a mode whereby an action taken by an organization of size (e.g. a government, a sporting event, a militia, etc.) is met with an equal cyber-attack reaction.   This is something which used to be happenstance, today it is the norm.  Taking into consideration factors like industry trends, expert insight and technology evolution there are still some surprises that have emerged on the threat landscape.  Some of the areas experiencing an unexpected acceleration in attacks are:\nSchool Districts are finding themselves as a relatively new industry to come under attack en masse.  Here at Radware, we have witnessed attacks on schools districts from nearly every region throughout the United States and Canada.  This year has had notable attacks in Texas with Spring Independent School District (SPRING ISD) and other similar attacks in Kansas and Pennsylvania. \nAdvertisers (e.g. the World Cup sponsors) are finding that their well spent and focus-grouped tested efforts can be thwarted by a cyber attack.  With their enormous reach and recognizable names and logos, brands are a prime target for attackers seeking press and an amplified voice.  Advertisers have experienced a challenge getting their word out or have had to compete with hacktivists diminishing their effectiveness.\nFinancial Service Firms need to prepare for DDoS the way school children dress in the morning – – with always checking what the daily risk of a storm is and how to prepare for it. It used to be that commercial and investment banks were the most terrorized by cyber-attacks, however, now we are finding that even arcane ATM and money-transfer organizations are feeling the pain associated with modern-day attacks, much of which is characterized as non-DDoS oriented.\nIn the coming months, the biggest security threats continue to be cyber-attacks that are focused on availability.  Availability-based attacks are a common method because they are indisputable – – they are by definition public and obvious.  They are very disruptive in today’s “always-on” business environments and they can have a lasting impact on the minds of the customers and do real damage to a company’s reputation and brand image.  They can also masquerade other more nefarious attacks which attempt to gain access to systems or data for nefarious purposes.  Expect these attacks to be spawned in different ways such as through social engineering, ransom-type attacks, and also nation-state attacks.  These attacks will also most likely continue to target industries such as financial services, government services, cloud and hosting environments, retailers, gaming sites, energy companies (oil, gas, power generation) and critical Infrastructure (telcos, water, police, fire, emergency response, power, etc.).  Expect also the Internet of Things to become pawns for cyber warfare — hijacked, leveraged and conscripted and discarded.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the research developed by our ERT, I invite you to download their annual report.  This report takes a deep dive into what attacks the previous year brought and what the coming year may still bring.  It’s a valuable resource and offers insights to help detect, mitigate and win the extended and persistent DoS/DDoS Battle.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'ERT\', \'hacktivism\', \'network security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/07/mid-year-recap-2014-network-security-predictions/');

However, it is  flawed at best.  \nSince the vast majority of Internet traffic is identified by DNS, as  soon as you roll over, the DDoS traffic will follow you to the Disaster site  when the DNS is rerouted\nCost\nThis will vary by the  size (floor space, CPU’s RAM, connection) and type (hot, warm, or cold) of the  Disaster Recovery site.  However, since  DR planning generally does not include provisions for DDoS, you will most  likely not get much usefulness out of this.\n\n\n3: Purchase an On-Premise DDoS Mitigation Appliance(s)\n\n\nDescription\nThese  appliances are made by a number of reputable vendors but differ in their  throughput and efficacy against the various types of attacks.  They use proprietary and patented engines to  sort the bad traffic from the good, letting only the good traffic through. \n As with any  process of this sort, there will be some mislabeling.  Some good traffic will probably get filtered  while some bad traffic will get through.   However, the losses are not enough to cause the servers and applications  to see a significant change in performance.\n The  critical issue is if you experience a volumetric DDoS attack, your internet  pipe will fill up so non-malicious traffic will still be essentially stopped  because of the access connection “traffic jam.”\nCost\nThe appliances  supporting these solutions can be purchased through vendors and cost may vary by  vendor, time of the month/quarter, amount purchased, and also the volume of  attacks that you are trying to repel.  \nThink  about what you expect your Internet connection growth to be over the next 3-5  years and size your purchase based upon that number plus 25%.\n\n\n4: Purchase a DDoS Mitigation Service From Your Hosting or Internet Provider\n\n\nDescription\nSome  hosting and cloud vendors offer DDoS mitigation as a premium service  add-on.  Check your contract to see if  this add-on is available.  \nMany of  them only deal with volumetric attacks, taking advantage of their connections  and resources to deal with the volume.   This option may not be wholly effective against resource and application  attacks.  (In many cases they are  reselling one of the mitigation services and purchasing the carrier grade DDoS  mitigation appliances.)\nThis type of service is generally better at fighting volumetric attacks  because it keeps that bulk traffic away from your Internet connection so it has  less of a possibility of being effective.   Depending upon the technology or provider being used, effectiveness  against the resource or application attacks will vary.\nCost\nThe good news is  these are generally operating expenses, not capital expense charges.  The bad news?   You have to be very watchful and deliberate about the service provider  you choose.  \n There are (generally)  two charging models.  The 1st is a flat  rate.  While more expensive up front, the  advantage is cost awareness.  \n The 2nd  model charges per attack or by the volume of traffic to be absorbed/cleaned  during attacks.  Lower up-front costs,  but when attack(s) come, the costs cannot be foreseen.  It boils down to risk tolerance and luck.  \n Note:  For large volumetric attacks against  companies with large Internet connections and recurring attacks – the charge  for the by-the-attack/by-volume services can get into the millions of dollars.\n \n\n\n4a: On-Demand DDoS Mitigation\n4b: Automatic DDoS Mitigation\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis type of service is only activated when the customer identifies an issue and contacts its provider.  The technologies are generally the same as the automatic services but the provider has a little more set up to do to make it operable.  This implementation is often done to reduce the provider’s cost-of-service or infrastructure so they can purchase a less capacity system or service and only use it when a customer calls in to enable it.\n\n\nDescription\nAutomatic should respond faster, but that depends on whether it is “Always-on” or “Always Available.”  “Always-on” generally means the service is integrated into the infrastructure and always looking for trouble against subscribed customers.  “Always Available” generally means that you are using an on-demand service.  The primary difference being that the provider is performing internal monitoring and will activate the service for you without the need to call them.\n\n\n\n\nCost\nThis is generally a lower cost than an automatic solution.  Providers can oversubscribe the service, assuming not all customers will be attacked simultaneously.   The downside is activation speed and the pre-activation impacts, since it may take some time to get the mitigation operational.\n\n\nCost\nThis type of service is generally a little more costly than the on-demand because it is Always-on” or “Always Available” so the provider has to purchase more solutions or service to support each active customer. \n\n\n\n\n\n5: Purchase a DDoS Mitigation Service from a Specialized Mitigation Service\n  \n\nDescription\nThis  skips the middle man of the provider model above. \n Customers  who purchase this service either change their DNS or their Internet routing so  all traffic, normal and attack, is redirected to the provider as a middle-man.  The mitigation services’ facility is purpose-built  with specialized hardware and a “secret sauce” that the provider has created to  identify and remove the bad traffic.\nThis type of service is generally better at dealing with the volumetric  attacks because it keeps that bulk traffic away from your Internet connection  so it has less of a possibility of being affected.  Depending upon the technology or provider  that it is using, effectiveness against resource or application attacks will  vary.\nCost\nThe good news is  these are generally operating expenses, not capital expense charges.  The bad news?   You have to be very watchful and deliberate about the service provider  you choose.  \n There are (generally)  two charging models.  The 1st is a flat  rate.  While more expensive up front, the  advantage is cost awareness. \n The 2nd  model charges per attack or by the volume of traffic to be absorbed/cleaned  during attacks.  Lower up-front costs,  but when attack(s) come, the costs cannot be foreseen.  It boils down to risk tolerance and luck.  \n \n\n\n5a: On-Demand DDoS Mitigation\n5b: Automatic DDoS Mitigation\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis type  of service is only activated when the customer identifies an issue and contacts  its provider.  This approach is often  done to remediate an attack in progress for organizations that do not currently  have protection.  There is a significant  delay in operationalizing these because all of the network/DNS changes have to  be made and propagate across the Internet.\n\n\nDescription\nAll of  your traffic passes through the provider, making this always-on and ready to  go.  For the major providers, it is very  possible you will not know there is a DDoS attack until the provider notifies  you. \nThat is just the way it should be, business as usual.\n\n\n\nCost\nThis  has no cost until activated but be forewarned that if you are suffering from an  attack to the point where you call one of the providers, it is highly probable  that the emergency-setup fees will be significant.\n\n\nCost\nFor the DDoS  Mitigation service, the cost comes down to which defense model you choose:  by the number of attacks, by attack volume or a  fixed rate.  If you choose one of the  former then the cost may be lower for the months or years that you do not get  attacked, but can skyrocket when activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n6: DDoS Hybrid System\n\n\nDescription\nThis approach  uses a combination of an on-premise system and the specialized mitigation or  provider-based solution.  The goal here  is to gain the best of both worlds by having the external service clear out the  bulk traffic and then use the on-premise system to surgically remove any other  remnants of the resource or layer 7 attacks that are getting through.\nCost\nMost  effective but also most expensive as it uses both solutions.\n\nThere you have it.  Choose  your solution based upon your risk tolerance and your budgetary  constraints.  Options abound.\n\nLike this article?

This cyber-attack, or rather virus, was reportedly introduced by a Russian hacking group and it targeted oil, gas, power, and energy investment companies.  The threatening malware had the ability to shut down major power grids, oil pipelines, gas, and energy traders.  Analysts speculate that the attack motive was to gain competitive advantage in state-sponsored espionage against global oil and energy producers.\n\nThis attack started by hacking into the websites of software companies that provide industrial control software.  The attackers poisoned software updates with the Energetic Bear Virus (Havex RAT is the technical name) and used a watering hole tactic.  This tactic maximized the attack’s impact because it infected numerous victims by drawing them to one destination – a somewhat trusted place on the Internet (one for software code upgrades).  \nThis could have been prevented with more earnest protection layers for their software distribution layers.  Previously, we’ve talked about the dangers of embedded systems and we all must be much more vigilant in watching the behavior of our devices.  Great security tools have behavior elements AND review all traffic, not just the popular or known ports.\nFor these energy companies, a properly placed Network Behavior Anomaly engine in the SCADA (Industrial Control) Network could have potentially picked up the call that went out to command and control servers.  While, other behaviors on the SCADA networks were mapping activities, the virus selected the other hosts on the network.  Those packets could have shown as anomalous and a Network Behavior Anomaly engine would have seen the host mapping activity and the call outs to the pop up domains. \nIt’s been relatively quiet since Energetic Bear was last reported. Does this mean the attacks are over?  Probably not.  An initial attack can always be a dry-run for bigger attacks.  Just recently, the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT published a number of mitigation techniques for organizations to consider.  From keeping your patches levels up to date to “whitelisting” legitimate executable directories.  They also requested any available evidence from an attack should be preserved for purposes of forensic analysis and law enforcement. \nAs this type of offense is a great defense, one can never be “too prepared” to protect themselves from a possible attack.  Especially if it’s against vital infrastructure that could potentially be shut down by a few keystrokes. \n\nLike this article?

Since your data will now reside in several different facilities, with different providers or partners, you now have a new “security perimeter” to monitor and defend.  As such, the need to closely evaluate how cloud-based data is protected should be part of the overall security strategy.  A top area of concern is defending applications from distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. \n\nA truly unfortunate example of this happened just this week.  Code Spaces, a source code hosting provider, was the victim of an assailant who used a combination of tools to compromise their entire Amazon Web Services-based architecture.  The threat began with an attempt to extort money from Code Spaces in exchange for stopping a multi-vector DDoS attack.  It ended with the attacker gaining control of the AWS console from Code Spaces and deleting almost all of the data stored in the cloud.  The resulting data loss – and payment of SLA remedies – means Code Spaces will no longer be able to operate as a company.  \nSuch an outcome is rare, but illustrates an important point – if you’re planning to move to the cloud, one of the first steps to take is creating a plan for dealing with the pervasive and growing threat that DDoS presents.  Most companies do not believe they have been a victim of a DDoS attack, so implementing the appropriate protections falls down the list of priorities for IT budgets.  In truth, most companies lack the detection tools to know how many attacks have been successfully completed against their digital assets.  IaaS and SaaS providers are uniquely capable of helping with creating a substantial defense against DDoS attacks.\nA proactive approach by the customer should include an evaluation of the DDoS mitigation capabilities of a cloud provider.  I recently wrote an article on IT Business Edge that lists some of the burning issues you should look for when adopting a DDoS mitigation strategy for a cloud-based solution.

However, it may cost some sponsors more than they’ve bargained for, as DDoS cyber-attacks were launched against World Cup sponsors.\nWhat is #OpWorldCup?\nDubbed #OpWorldCup and #OpHackingCup, Anonymous has launched a number of DDoS attacks against those who sponsored the month long soccer match, the official World Cup website, and the government websites of Brazil — all in the name of retaliation for the alleged exorbitant preparation costs for the World Cup.  It’s believed that an estimated $11 billion has been spent, which caused the geopolitical climate in Brazil to rise and this garnered the attention of Anonymous.\nSponsors and advertisers have become caught in the cross-fire.  Collateral damage, if you will.  It has been reported that sponsors such as Adidas, Budweiser, Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Sony and Visa are all on Anonymous’ list of targets in this latest cyber-attack.  These corporations have spent millions of dollars just to advertise, and now have to add in the costs of their websites being down or defaced. \n\nThe Anonymous threat to strike down the World Cup sponsors’ websites first surfaced in February of 2014.  Although there was ample time to prepare for possible DDoS attacks, can you blame an advertiser or sponsor if they overlooked this potential threat? Not all companies are typical targets of hacktivists until they’ve aligned themselves with those who are.  Websites of companies such as Hyundai, Johnson Controls and Emirates have been targeted for their association to the World Cup and even many Brazilian government websites have been defaced or have been down for several days at the time of this writing. \nDepending on the severity of these DDoS attacks and website defacement during the World Cup, security teams in the consumer product space may have to start assessing the risk of marketing programs in the future to get the true cost of doing business.  This may very well dissuade corporations to put their advertising dollars into major sports programs that may have a geopolitical situation attached to it. \nAnd those costs aren’t cheap – In a 2013 Radware ERT Report, total cost of unplanned datacenter outages caused by DoS/DDoS attack was estimated to be $822,000 in 2013.  The report also finds that some organizations have not budgeted for a dedicated DoS/DDoS mitigation solution in 2014 with some businesses relying on adjacent technologies such as firewall, or intrusion prevention systems. However, such technologies have little success in attempting to mitigate sophisticated DoS/DDoS attacks.\nStrategies to Help Protect against a DDoS Cyber-Attack\nCompanies and government sites that do find themselves in the DDoS crosshairs can deploy these three mitigation strategies and tactics that will help protect them against DDoS attacks: \nEmploy the Shortest Time to Mitigate:  When deploying DoS/DDoS mitigation solutions, organizations need to ensure that their detection and mitigation solutions can detect attacks and start the mitigation process within the shortest time possible.  Solutions that require traffic diversion for attack mitigation may suffer from a longer time to mitigate.  In addition, when the DoS/DDoS mitigation solution is built from disparate separated solutions, the switch between the different mitigation solutions may delay the time the mitigation process starts.  Organizations need to look at time-to-mitigation as a key success factor, and ensure that the solution they deploy provides the shortest time-to-mitigate.\nWide Mitigation Coverage:  Organizations should look for a DoS/DDoS mitigation solution that offers wide attack coverage.  Such solution should mitigate volumetric network attacks, SSL attacks, as well as application level attack vectors.\nSingle Point of Contact in Case of an Attack:  With this wide range of detection and mitigation options on one hand, and the pressure to start the mitigation actions as soon as possible on the other hand, it is crucial that your organization will have a single point of contact in case of an attack.  Be it an internal security team employed with DoS/DDoS experts that are ready to get to action in minutes or an external emergency response team that can be called to action with minutes, these teams should help the organization choose the correct mitigation options and help divert the Internet traffic between the different mitigation solutions.\nTo keep updated on sites that have been affected by this latest DDoS attack from Anonymous, please visit DDoSWarriors.com and click the link “track #OpWorldCup.”\n\nLike this article?

Most attackers will  now chain an Elevation of Privileges (EoP) attack to achieve persistency on the  device.  \nVulnerable  Client-Side applications, such as PDF Reader are another potential point of  infiltration.Â  Malicious files, such as a  PDF, DOC, AVI, etc. can exploit a weakness in less than 40 seconds.Â  This attack is becoming increasingly common  for mobile users and similarly to browser attacks, attackers will chain PDF  vulnerabilities with EoP attacks. Â Also  other client-side software (calendar invites, default handlers, etc.) are an  additional risk.\n\nIt  is important to understand that Apps are not the most important threat vector. Â In the past 2-3 years, it seemed that Apps  were the master of all evil and nearly every mobile security upstart focused (or  is currently focusing on) the App.  The security protection industry grew  up by conjecturing a threat generated from Apps with solutions based on ‘containerization  and additional sandboxing technology’ â all of this to promote Apps as the  primary threat vector.   Although helpful, and not to minimize the  threat associated with Apps, but the reality is that the data doesn’t really  support the problem today.  No, the reality of today’s tactical mobile  security mobile problem is actually something different.Â  Put yourself into a cyber-criminal’s  mind.  Do you think you’d wait for a prospective target to download  an app in which you can exploit? Â Or is  it more desirable to have more control of who and where you’d like to  infiltrate?  For a myriad of reasons, at the moment, it is unlikely Apps  will be used by the most heinous hackers to infiltrate organizations. Â \nBoth  iOS and Android devices have been hacked using other methods from what I’ve  described and both iOS and Android should be equally considered legitimate  targets for today’s threats.Â  Embedded  code is the real issue – – especially in light of the prevalence of ‘rooting’  phones.  Droid and iPhones are routinely rooted or ‘jail broken’ and this  represents outliers in security controls and data.Â  This can result in out-of-date O/S code,  unauthorized modifications and also the ability to add code which was  previously deemed unsafe.\nWhat Can You Do  About These Threats?  \nMobile  security is not simple and one should take multiple factors into consideration  in terms of protection.Â  First, ensure  the device, source and endpoint reputation.Â   This is valuable, and can be accomplished by looking at the way in which  the device connects or at its ‘session analytics.’Â  The way in which the authentication and  authorization series is executed can reveal any anomalies in usage such as an  attempt to pollute up and down stream through improper session and account  management.Â  Lastly, and also important  to consider, is the behavioral impacts of abusive transactions within a session  itself, such as the ability to add code which was previously deemed unsafe.\nLike  any data communication network, mobile contains a range of security threats.  Though some threats are easy to identify and mitigate, others are illusive, due  to the unique structure and complexity of mobile networks.Â  If you’re interested in learning more on not  just device threats but the threats faced by the mobile networks, including information  on mobile network entry points and a thorough rundown of availability threats  to mobile networks, I invite you to download the recent Availability Risks in Mobile  Networks research  report from the Radware Emergency Response Team.\n\nLike this article?

The customer claimed  its SMTP server was overwhelmed by a connection far above normal rates. The initial  investigation revealed no pattern indicating malicious traffic, but a deeper  analysis showed that more than 50% of the SMTP transactions where bounced  messages. \nBounced messages, also known as Non-Delivery  Notifications (NDN), are sent when an email server accepts an email but later  finds out that it is unable to deliver it for whatever reason (spam, recipient  not exist).  In this case, the attacker  spoofed the sender’s email and a bounce message was generated to the original  sender (specified in the ‘From:’ command line).  Using spam attacks or worm propagation, the  attacker managed to have a huge amount of bounce messages directed to the email  addresses that were spoofed. This effect is known as “Email Backscatter.” \nThe question the ERT aimed to answer when analyzing  this specific attack was whether this Email Backscatter was a side effect of  spam or worm propagation, or whether it was a deliberate DoS attack.  An attacker can indeed send emails to various  mail servers and spoof the senders’ address to those of its real target. This  makes the attack reflective but unlike DNS, NTP and CHARGEN, this attack is  carried over TCP rather than UDP. \n\nAn Email Backscatter effect, when carried out as a deliberate  DDoS attack, can create an amplification effect.  It depends on the implementation of the mail  server acting as the reflector.  Some  mail servers will send bounce messages that include the entire original email, while  others will further send it to each and every recipient that was accepted  during the original sent.  This means  that if the attacker was sending the email to 50 recipients, certain mail  servers will generate 50 bounce messages.  This will produce a 50 time amplification  effect.  \nDuring the investigation the ERT also found that  more than 25% of the bounce messages were coming from Amazon email servers and  they have confirmed that indeed the IPs belonged to Amazon.  The rest of the bounce messages arrived from  other familiar mail servers such as LinkedIn.  However, it was not possible to determine if  this was a deliberate DoS attack or just a side effect of spam or worm  propagation. \nWhen an organization realizes it is under such an  attack it should identify the event as an Email Backscatter as soon as  possible.  How is that done?  Bounce messages exist in normal traffic, however,  their extreme ratio and in most cases, the usage of non-existing users, will  indicate an Email Backscatter. Once identified, there are several ways to mitigate  such an attack, for example, rejecting or rate-limiting bounce email during the  attack period. \n\nLike this article?

Who else is using the solution? \nA good question:  “Is this solution being used by cloud MSSPs  that provide anti-DDoS services?”   Industry leading MSSPs that provide anti-DDoS services are some of the  most demanding customers when it comes to DDoS protection services.  They  understand the nature of different attacks, the various mitigation technologies  and the expectations of their customers.  Asking for MSSP references is a wise move.\n\n2. Learn their speed of detection &  mitigation.\nAn ideal DDoS mitigation solution detects  and blocks attacks at the perimeter of the victim organization’s data center –  before the attack can impact IT infrastructure.  Such a defense configuration allows for  real-time protection.  Solutions that are  purely cloud-based – and have no detectors in the organizations data center –  do not protect against an attack until attack traffic is manually redirected by  an Internet Service Provider to flow through an MSSP for scrubbing. This  process can take minutes or hours, is complicated to manage, and effectively  leaves an organization and its customers exposed to a DDoS attack until the  attack can be redirected for scrubbing.\n3. How do they (or can they) distinguish  between legitimate users and attackers?\nUnlike other cyber security threats, a DDoS  attack is composed of many legitimate requests.   Only the large volumes of simultaneous requests actually constitute an  attack.  Since every request in a DDoS  attack looks legitimate, the biggest challenge for anti-DDoS mitigation is to  distinguish between attacker requests and legitimate user requests.  Standard anti-DDoS solutions design their  mitigation strategy on rate limit methodologies that are triggered once the  traffic crosses a pre-defined threshold.  This approach can result in relatively high  false-positives and blocks legitimate users from accessing the services.  \nAdvanced anti-DDoS solutions deploy more sophisticated attack mitigation technologies such as behavioral analysis that compares the current traffic to  normal baselines and makes intelligent decisions regarding the attack  mitigation.  In addition, there are  mechanisms that challenge suspicious sources and based on the response from the  source, it can be determined if the source is a Bot or a legitimate user.\nThere are many additional important questions to ask when making the  choice about who will protect you and your customers.  From attack coverage to attack types  (SSL-based DDoS attacks, low & slow DDoS attacks) to Internet pipe  saturation, I invite you to read this whitepaper on DDoS Selection Criteria and gain more information about the right questions when selecting an  anti-DDoS vendor. \n\nLike this article?

I know how excited I was the first time somebody wanted to share $8M dollars with me from my long lost Uncle Frederick Hobbs IV, heir to the estate of the late Frederick the Great or some other nonsense.   I immediately daydreamed about what color the new cool car I would buy with cash would be. \n\nSocial engineering scams attempt to psychologically manipulate their victims to hand over confidential and sensitive information, and most of us learned pretty quickly to be cautious when we suspect this type of activity.  While working for a large financial institution, I learned just how prevalent these types of attacks were.  Our mail servers processed anywhere from 9-15 million bounced e-mails per hour and it was a challenge for our teams to deal with this volume of fraudulent messages – all coming from one of our legitimate e-mail addresses.  Today, clever scammers are putting a new face on their attacks.  One method is by using call center labor from foreign countries to run call scripts.  Criminals and fraudsters are also investing in call robots and low cost voice systems that use the Internet for phone calls and message gateways. \n\nHere’s how this new fraud technique is changing the  scams of the past.  \n  My home phone rings.   Somebody says they are from Microsoft Security and they are calling  because my computer has been sending them alerts for the last 2-3 weeks.  They think I might have a virus.  They want to help me.  Can I go turn my computer on?  I play  along, as I’m curious to see where this is going, and well, I don’t have a  Microsoft based computer, so this should be fun.  They wait until I tell them my computer is on  and then ask me to look at the event viewer for log files … look for any errors  … it’s a virus (they claim).  Next, I  MUST go to some web site and download their “fix.”  This, I can only guess, is the virus that  will encrypt my files until I pay them the $300 ransom to get my computer  back.  I ended the call at this point and  called my Phone Service Provider’s CTO and explained what happened.  This resulted in a short-term fix while the  scammers had to adapt and possibly get new methods.\nThe next new social engineering scam starts with a text.  A message from a service number on my mobile (you know like 123-45) from: (real name of a big bank) with an identification code:  12345678 (some random number set) saying to \"Enter online at prompt in password field at login.\"  Within minutes, my cell phone rings from some 877 number.  A voice message system plays the following to me:\n\n\"This message is an important reminder for (my name). \n  Recently, somebody attempted to change the password of your account with (name of big bank).  A temporary pin was granted on your account so that they may access your account. \nIf you did not request this temporary activation pin, please call us immediately at (877-some-number) and report it immediately.\"\n\nMy guess is this 877 number is a fraudulent call center just waiting to pounce.  They’ll request your social security number, bank account logins, and anything else you would fall for during the \"verification process\" that we’ve all gotten used to.  I pulled out my personal ATM card, called the number on the back and asked the bank if any of this activity really happened.  They verified it was not real.  After sharing my story, I found out that a lot of people are getting hit by this two pronged social attack.\nAre there ways to improve your protection from these  attacks?  Yes.  For your company, just raising awareness  among your teams and HR departments about these threats is a step in the right  direction.  Another tool is  detection.  This is especially useful for  the service providers out there or people using call centers and voice over IP  gateways.  Service providers who are  interested in detecting these kinds of activities may want to look at security  solutions that offer custom signatures.   Carrier grade equipment that can rapidly  detect repeating patterns across different systems is extremely rare to  find.  Here at Radware, for attack  mitigation we pair up the monitoring solution InFlight with the DefensePro system to build signatures for message and call log  gateways to identify these kinds of robo-dial systems and text message fraud  systems.   We have successfully helped  many call centers and voice over IP providers to detect these kinds of scams  and stop them as they transit the network.     Ask your local Radware Team for  more information if you are interested in helping to solve these problems on  your network!\n\nLike this article?

How We Tested  (And Stopped) the Facebook Notes Flaw', 'Ron Meyran', '2014-5-19', 'Recently, independent researcher Chaman Thapa published a report on an attack scenario showing how someone could use Facebook Notes to DDoS any website.  When Facebook and DDoS enter the conversation, news spreads quickly and questions emerge.  What is the flaw?  How serious is it?  Who or what can be affected?  The Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) decided to take a look at the Facebook Notes attack type by testing it in our lab.  First, here’s some background:\n\nWhat is ‘Facebook Notes’:\nFacebook Notes is an application offered by Facebook.  It allows users to use tags \n\n and link to external images and files.  When Notes are published, any viewer of the Note will see the image via Facebook fetching the image and then presenting it the user.\nHow can it be used for Attacks?\nDuring Thapa’s research, he noticed an anomaly.  Facebook will not fetch the same image twice.  This led him to suggest the following attack:\nIf even a single bogus parameter is changed in the URL that is requested, Facebook will fetch it again-and-again.  An attacker can create a Note like this: \n\n* From “A Programmer’s Blog”\nThe Note tags above would cause Facebook to make 1,000 HTTP request to the targeted site.  If an attacker were to open even 10 pages per second, that Note could potentially generate an average of 10,000 HTTP requests to the targeted site.  Using large images or even PDF files can amplify this effect so that essentially, one small request could potentially pull several megabytes of traffic back.  In one test, Thapa was able to pull 900Mbps from a website – large enough to kill either the web server or the Internet pipe of many websites. \nIf a malicious user were to craft a Note with numerous links, many HTTP requests and the resulting increase in traffic sent to a victim’s site may cause an outage.\nWhat is Facebook Doing about This?\nThapa shared his research with Facebook’s Bug Bounty program and was told they “appreciated this report and discussed it at some length.” Ultimately, however the social media giant decided against making changes to “avoid disrupting intended and desirable functions.”\n\nHere’s Our Test:\nRadware ERT researched how difficult it is to stop such an attack yet found that even the most basic Web Challenge mitigation technique could block it.  Web Challenge, a common technology to block HTTP application attacks, is available in many security systems today. \nHere’s how the block works:  \nWhen under attack the security system challenges all HTTP requests and sends them back a 302 Redirect reply. Included in this reply is a special cookie. Legitimate users using normal browsers will honor the redirect command, even without the user necessarily noticing.  They will send the HTTP cookie back, which will authenticate them to the security system and allow them to go on to their desired sever.  Attackers using scripts, however, which generate dozens of request per second, do not wait for the response.  They are unable to process the 302 redirect or to save the cookie. \nSummary:\nAlthough Facebook reviewed Thapa’s research and decided against a fix, it is interesting that this flaw could potentially generate up to 900 Mbps of web traffic from a social media site that is accessible to 728 million daily users.  Granted – there are other “go-to” attack vectors that cyber-attackers could use at their disposal for DDoS, but this flaw piqued our interest due to Facebook’s worldwide presence. \n\nLike this article?

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (377, 'Facebook, Google, Yahoo — How Hackers Can Use Everyday Sites for Reflection & Amplification Attacks', 'David Hobbs', '2014-5-14', 'Reflection and amplification attacks are used to extend DDoS harm.  Recently, I discussed how the most recent unwelcome arrival of HTTP-based reflectors and amplifiers have had a more significant impact than past standard floods and I wondered, what would happen if attackers started using Facebook for link “loading” with fake accounts?  The possibilities seemed endless and, according to “A Programmer’s Blog,” somebody has already worked on this and created a 400 MB flood using only Facebook Mobile. \nThis new Facebook attack is similar to how a Google Doc DDoS attack was launched a few years back when Google Docs were being used to create spreadsheets as a weapon for DDoS.  Both of these attack types use a web link or a list of web links or URLs.  They also can both put variables on the end of the file, so that if the customer uses a CDN, it can punch through the CDN to the origin server.  These attacks can also use a real URL on demand in order to drive up the cost of the CDN.\nAnother factor to consider that could further this reflector/amplifier attack is that it appears that Yahoo is now loading links via their mail program.   From the compose feature, one can now start pasting links into the e-mail and their fetcher/crawler will start loading up the pages for preview.   During the testing of this concept, I noticed it was very easy to paste a link, hit return, paste another link, hit return — and Yahoo would go fetch and “preview” the link, resize the images, etc.  This could easily be scripted with a browser plugin like Grease Monkey or link with the Facebook “notes” exploit in an effort to amplify damage.\n\nHow could a hacker put these attacks in a combination?  First, create a Facebook Note with 1,000 URL’s.  Then, load up a script to hit that note file via a WordPress Pingback.  Next, put the same list in Google Docs to load every hour, and then start referencing the links via Yahoo Mail preview and keep the ping going.  It wouldn’t be very difficult to daisy chain the attacks and launch combination attacks from various reflectors to keep hitting various online companies.\nAttacks like this could easily be implemented from a public Wi-Fi enabled network (an airport, mall, coffee shop) offering anonymity as a great cover for the attacker.  No one would black list all of these online services and many web sites and platforms have stated this is not a bug, so they will not be “fixing” this.  With this in consideration, some of the solutions suggested to fix this flaw, really aren’t a fix.  One recommendation was to block Facebook’s IP range from their loaders.   However, this can be more destructive if you set an image source to be some search function in the victim site.  It will cause the remote site to do SQL queries itself for searching, and if the content that should be searched for matches is large, the result is clear.\nThe difficulty in fighting these kinds of attacks is that often the wrong defense is chosen.   DDoS services that require you to pass your data center traffic over to them to “clean” the traffic are expensive (and generally) should only be used for emergencies.   Network reflection attacks often require this kind of emergency service.  HTTP requests coming from Google or Facebook or WordPress tend to be classified as legitimate traffic, so it becomes very challenging to mitigate this and this makes having on premise protection a necessity.\nHybrid DDoS solutions combine to share attack signaling and stop threats.  If you’re interested in learning more about an integrated detection and mitigation solution for DDoS attacks, I invite you to register and download a whitepaper on Radware’s new Attack Mitigation Network. \n\nLike this article?

An existential threat to many organizations, cyber-attacks can target the fidelity and integrity of an industry, from financial services to power generation. Due to this, regulators throughout the world are stepping in to try and drive meaningful action where they believe it is required.  These early efforts may be the harbingers of future legislation and give birth to standard approaches and forums to debate the efficacy in approaches. Just this week, the Governor of New York State, Andrew Cuomo, announced “the release of a cyber security report that shows the growing risk and sophistication of cyber attacks facing New York banks, and directed the Department of Financial Services (DFS) to conduct new, regular, targeted cyber security preparedness assessments of the banks DFS regulates.” \nAttacks continue to change the information security landscape and this change hasn’t gone unnoticed by regulators.  Now, depending on where your business operates, you must demonstrate your diligence to these threats.  Here for your review are six organizations that are currently addressing cyber threats.\n\n \nOrganization: National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework\nDriver\nIn response to a  Presidential directive, on Oct. 22nd 2013, the United States NIST  released the latest version of its cybersecurity framework which aims  to better secure U.S. companies and government agencies. The new draft goes  into significantly greater detail than an earlier version released Aug. 28 and  it laid out higher level principles of the framework, items referred to as  ‘pillars.’ \nInitiative\nThree central  pillars to the new framework were designed to provide industry and government  with common cyber security taxonomy, establish goals, intended targets,  identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement, assess progress and  improve communication among stakeholders.  \n The final  framework was announced on February 12, 2014 and should be the driving force  behind the way in which all US Government operated and US Government-procured  systems will be secured from cyber-attacks going forward. \n\nOrganization: Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OFSI) DDoS Memorandum\nDriver\nEarlier this year,  large Canadian-based banks were hit by cyber-attacks whereby one or more  hackers used a brute force \"denial of service\" attack to disable some  bank websites and mobile applications. Similar to Operation Ababil, which targeted  US-based banks in 2012; these attacks slowed down website operations and caused  many bank sites to be inoperative for a significant portion of their customers.\nInitiative\nMindful of this  very real threat and the need to manage risk, on October 28, 2013 OSFI released  a memorandum to federally regulated Canadian financial institutions  (\"FRFIs\") discussing the measures that should be taken to prevent,  manage and remediate cyber-attacks. The memorandum states that cyber security  is growing in importance because: (i) FRFIs increasingly rely on technology;  (ii) the financial sector is interconnected; and (iii) FRFIs play a critical  role in our economy.  As part of this  memorandum, OSFI required all FRFIs to conduct a self-assessment of the risks  and take actions against those risks.  OSFI  also will be reviewing the fidelity of the assessment and the corresponding  risk mitigation steps.\n\nOrganization: FFIEC Joint Statement  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Cyber-Attacks, Risk Mitigation, and  Additional Resources (US)\nDriver\nThe Federal  Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) members are issued  statements to notify financial institutions of the risks associated with  cyber-attacks on Automated Teller Machine and card authorization systems and  the continuation of DDoS attacks on public-facing websites. \nInitiative\nThe statements  describe steps the members expect institutions to take to address attacks and  highlight resources institutions can use to help mitigate the risks posed by  such attacks.  The members also expect  financial institutions to address DDoS readiness as part of their ongoing  information security and incident plans. More specifically, each institution is  expected to monitor incoming traffic to its public website, activate incident  response plans if it suspects that a DDoS attack is occurring, and ensure  sufficient staffing for the duration of the attack, including the use of  pre-contracted third-party servicers, if appropriate.\nThe FFIEC is  guiding its members to do the following:\n\nMaintain an ongoing program to assess information security risk that  identifies, prioritizes, and assesses the risk to critical systems, including  threats to external websites and online accounts; \nMonitor Internet traffic to the institution’s website to detect attacks\nActivate incident response plans and notify service providers, including  Internet service providers (ISPs), as appropriate, if the institution suspects  that a DDoS attack is occurring. Response plans should include appropriate  communication strategies with customers concerning the safety of their  accounts.\nEnsure sufficient staffing for the duration of the DDoS attack and  consider hiring pre-contracted third-party servicers, as appropriate, that can  assist in managing the Internet-based traffic flow. Identify how the  institution’s ISP can assist in responding to and mitigating an attack.\nConsider sharing information with organizations, such as the Financial  Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center and law enforcement.  Attacks can change rapidly and sharing the  information can help institutions to identify and mitigate new threats and  tactics.\nEvaluate any gaps in the institution’s response following attacks and in  its ongoing risk assessments, and adjust risk management controls accordingly. \n\n\nOrganization:  Securities and Exchange Commission Cyber Exams (US)\nDriver\nOn April 15, 2014  the SEC announced inaugural exams of member companies along with a list of  questions they will be using as a guide to these reviews.  The SEC governs most of the financial services  which do not fall under the FFIEC jurisdiction.   So, all mutual  funds, wealth management and hedge funds (among many others) are regulated not by FFIEC guidelines, but rather SEC guidelines.   Unlike the FFIEC  and there regulatory arms (OCC, FDIC, OTS, & NCUA) up to this point the SEC  did conduct ad-hoc reviews, however, routine security reviews were maintained.\nInitiative\nAssessment  questions directly address the cyber-attack scenario sets:\nSince January 1,  2013, has your Firm experienced any of the following types of events? If so,  please provide a brief summary for each category listed below, identifying the  number of such incidents (approximations are acceptable when precise numbers  are not readily available) and describing their significance and any effects on  the Firm, its customers, and its vendors or affiliates.  If the response to any one item includes more  than 10 incidents, the respondent may note the number of incidents and describe  incidents that resulted in losses of more than $5,000 the unauthorized access  to customer information, or the unavailability of a Firm service for more than  10 minutes.  The record or description  should, at a minimum, include: the extent to which losses were incurred,  customer information accessed, and Firm services impacted; the date of the  incident; the date the incident was discovered and the remediation for such  incident.\n Malware was  detected on one or more Firm devices. Please identify or describe the malware. \n\nAccess to a Firm web site or network resource was blocked or impaired by  a denial of service attack. Please identify the service affected, and the  nature and length of the impairment. \nThe availability of a critical Firm web or network resource was impaired  by a software or hardware malfunction. Please identify the service affected,  the nature and length of the impairment, and the cause. \nThe Firm’s network was breached by an unauthorized user. Please describe  the nature, duration, and consequences of the breach, how the Firm learned of  it, and how it was remediated. \nThe Firm was the subject of an extortion attempt by an individual or  group threatening to impair access to or damage the Firm’s data, devices,  network, or web services.\n\n\nOrganization:  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Guidance (US)\nDriver\nIn December 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) notified its member financial institutions that DDoS attacks are on the rise and that they expect their members to take steps to identify the risks associated with the attacks and to provide notification to the OCC and others if they are under attack.  The guidance reads:  “Recently, various sophisticated groups launched distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks directed at national banks and federal savings associations (collectively, banks). Each of the groups had different objectives for conducting these attacks ranging from garnering public attention to diverting bank resources while simultaneous online attacks were under way and intended to enable fraud or steal proprietary information. This alert provides a general description of the attacks, along with risk mitigation information and sources of related risk management guidance.” \nInitiative\nThe alert reiterates the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) expectations that banks should have risk management programs to identify and appropriately consider new and evolving threats to online accounts and to adjust their customer authentication, layered security, and other controls as appropriate in response to changing levels of risk.  The OCC expects banks that are victims of or adversely affected by a DDoS attack to report this information to law enforcement authorities and to notify their supervisory office. Additionally, banks should voluntarily file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) if the DDoS attack affects critical information of the institution including customer account information, or damages, disables or otherwise affects critical systems of the bank.\n\nOrganization:  National Credit Union Administration Risk Alert (US)\nDriver\nIn February 2013, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) issued a Risk Alert to member credit union institutions on “Mitigating Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks.” \nInitiative\nThe alert included  the following verbiage: The increasing frequency of cyber-terror attacks on  depository institutions heightens the need for credit unions to maintain strong  information security protocols. Recent incidents have included distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which cause Internet-based service outages by  overloading network bandwidth or system resources. DDoS attacks do not directly  attempt to steal funds or sensitive personal information, but they may be  coupled with such attempts to distract attention and/or disable alerting  systems.\n Clearly the sense  of urgency and ferocity of the attacks came through in the alert and provided  for an understanding of the issues being broader than the availability of  credit union systems.\n\nNo one can say for certain how all of this will play out, however given the increased frequency, directed attacks, and effectiveness of the techniques, we can safely assume that regulators and government legislators will take heed from public calls-to-action and will continue to drive prescriptive steps for all relevant organizations to follow.\n\nLike this article?

The attack on Spamhaus in 2013 supported this  claim.   The DDoS attack on Spamhaus, an international non-profit dedicated to  battling spam, is considered one of the largest in Internet history — reaching  300Gbps. The massive size of this attack  created a changed perspective on cyber threats, one usually reserved for  financial debt.  When debt is reasonable,  it’s your problem. When the debt is huge, it’s everyone’s problem.  With the Spamhaus attack – it was so massive –  it threatened the integrity of the Internet infrastructure – and this became  everyone’s problem.\nIn nearly 100% of DDoS attack cases the  victim’s network infrastructure was designed to process the excessive traffic, yet  it failed to maintain application availability. To understand why this occurs,  let’s take a look at what has changed in the last two years and the ways  cybercrime has evolved. \nAttacker Disguise Themselves\nAttackers have learned that most  mitigation tools are using the black listing of IP addresses to block botnet-based  attacks. They overcome this black listing by launching attacks with dynamic IP  addresses, or use proxy servers, CDNs, anonymizers or encrypted communications  to avoid detection.\nWeb Stealth Attacks\nWeb Stealth Attacks are a set of DoS/DDoS  attack vectors that include brute-force attacks (e.g. attacks on the login  page), file upload violations, SSL encrypted application attacks and more.\nAn example, which does not gain much  media attention, despite its frequency increase is the login page attack.  Login page attacks embody the concept of the  weak link.  Organizations invest in network  security to protect their web servers and applications; they settle on demand capacity  allocation plans to address accidental traffic growth; however securing the  login servers is not always addressed properly.  Attackers overwhelm the login servers with  relatively low volumes of login requests – in an effort to deny service from  legitimate users. \nFigure 1: attacks on login page are highly destructive – based on SSL to evade detection; exploits the limited resources of the login servers.\nAttackers Bypass CDN Protection\nThe Content Delivery market is expanding.  While Content Delivery Network (CDN) solutions are being widely adopted by  content providers (e.g. media companies, content aggregators, etc.), other  verticals have started to use CDNs as a content-caching mechanism to provide a  better user experience. Hackers overcome the powerful cache offloading  mechanism, which is the core of CDN solutions, by asking for dynamic content.  Using this method, attackers build attack tools that go below CDN radar and  manage to saturate the application servers (in the data-center).\nFigure 2: attackers bypass CDN protection  by asking for dynamic content.Source: Global Application and Network  Security Report 2013, Radware.\nChange is headed your  way whether you’re prepared or not and DoS/DDoS attacks are the weapon of  choice.  These attacks are regularly  increasing in severity and complexity, so if you’re looking for more insight to  help detect, mitigate and win this battle, I invite you to please download the 2013 Global Application and Network Security Report.  It’s a  great resource to learn how attackers are bypassing new mitigation tools and  also offers information on what features you should look for in DoS/DDoS  protection.\n\nLike this article?

The nature of such an attack is very similar to a buffer overflow attack, where a remote attacker can exploit the protocol by sending a malformed “heartbeat” request with a payload size bigger than the actual request. In response, the vulnerable server would return a heartbeat response that contains a memory block of up to 64KB in the payload. This memory block can potentially reveal confidential information, including SSL private keys, user passwords and more. The researchers that found this vulnerability have put together an informative micro site that explains all of this.\n\nHow do I know if my Radware Products are vulnerable?\nRadware has tested all of its products and recently announced to its customers that its Alteon, AppDirector, DefensePro and DefenseSSL are not vulnerable to the attack. Specific versions of Radware’s Web Application Firewall, (AppWall) and Radware’s Web Performance Optimization solution (FastView) were found vulnerable to Heartbleed data-leakage and were updated immediately. Please make sure to read Radware’s Security Advisory to ensure that you are running a non-vulnerable version.\nI found that one of my servers is vulnerable. What should I do?\nFollow these 3 steps:\n\nImmediately upgrade all of your vulnerable servers to the latest version that is not vulnerable for such an attack. \nOnce all systems (either Radware’s or other solutions) are upgraded and found to be non-vulnerable, make sure to re-issue all certificates that were used.\nEnsure you replace all passwords for both internal and consumer use.\n\nUpgrading all of my servers may take me months. How do I stop this vulnerability?\nOver the last week there were a large number of announcements about solutions that can or cannot be used to block data leakage as a result from this vulnerability.  The short answer is – it depends:\n\nTo date, there is no “silver bullet” that will keep your data safe with no false positives (i.e. blocking legitimate transactions). However, Radware’s solution allows you to pick a protection method while you’re still working on upgrading your servers.\nAs Heartbleed is a vulnerability in the TLS Heartbeat protocol ask yourself whether or not you really need to open your network to this protocol.

This means that the 12 year-old system could leave behind security holes for users who haven’t upgraded.\n\nWho or What Uses XP?\nATMs and Point of Sale Systems are the most public facing places, but what will the end of Windows XP mean for all of the unseen places it lives?\nIn a recent article, we explored the vulnerabilities in airline transportation, we also thought what other areas in transportation could be at risk through vulnerabilities. One to note is the FIRE (Functionality Integrated Railroad Electronics) locomotive display and cab computer which incidentally is built on a Microsoft Windows embedded XP.  This advanced system is designed to assist the locomotive management with safety and crew operations and it also aides the engineer’s management of the locomotive’s performance. This FIRE system has desirable vulnerabilities for a hacker — 802.11b Wi-Fi and cellular GPRS backup. Without an active Wi-Fi defense, a Wi-Fi hacking tool like GrimWepa could easily infect this system and once infected the train could communicate with a hacker over cellular. \nThe train and locomotive system threats vary. One consideration is that train control software has a software developer kit – which enables third parties to build code for the locomotive.  If the system was hacked, this software and any accompanying protocol could be exposed.\nThrough the communication system, freight cars transmit safety alarms and status information to the locomotive as well as receive commands and information requests from the locomotive. If the system were publicly known there is the potential for someone to overwrite it.  A scary scenario would be for this system to be overridden to NOT transmit alarms.  What if this system turned off the brakes while pinning the accelerator open?  This one example of a public safety threat as a result of OS changes is just as terrifying as the financial loss angle frequently being reported.\n“What If” Someone Looked at the Cyber Warfare Aspect?\nThere are many other systems out there that use embedded Windows XP and there is the risk that exploiting other Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system exploits could cause massive damage. A similar occurrence of this was Stuxnet.  Stuxnet was a virus that attacked an operating system and targeted industrial control systems.  It was recognized as an intentional act of cyber warfare against Iran and it reportedly ruined almost one-fifth of the country’s nuclear centrifuges.\nExploiting critical SCADA systems is a very serious threat as it seems to me that industrial systems are the most fragile in production environments and are often are not being upgraded or maintained. \n\nLike this article?

Heartbleed is unique in the collateral damage it can create. \nHeartbleed exposes the ugly side of open-source security components: In past events, where such Earth-shaking vulnerabilities were found, there was a vendor that would pay for the collateral damages that the vulnerability created. Who would pay for the collateral damages of this open-source vulnerability? It is likely be the users that are using OpenSSL.\n\nIt’s also a sad day for NIST and the FIPS 140-2 audit labs, and for the FIPS certification market-advocates.  OpenSSL was the first open-source module that went through FIPS 140-2 validation process. FIPS 140-2 is the most appreciated token of robustness and security. However, Heartbleed may raise concerns of FIPS validation, just like the Target breach raised questions about the robustness of PCI.\nWhat security professionals need to do:\n\nNext budget planning: Whenever considering an open-source security solution vs. a commercial / proprietary one, add to your risk and cost calculations the (lack-of) indemnification for damages created by open-source vulnerabilities to your risk/cost calculations. TCO and ROI models may change considerably based on this item.\nNext Security Review:  Don’t be fooled by 3rd party audit, compliance and validation processes. Always make sure that you understand the known risks, build proper security architecture and run penetration tests. Remember that there are no free-lunches in this process.\nNext Steps:  Review your security architecture. There is always a room to improve. Have you considered Web Application Firewall? IPS solution or DLP?  None of them are perfect but the multi-layer approach may save the day.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that you don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The tone in cyber-security planning is using multi-layers for data-protection. You may use OpenSSL to encrypt your sensitive data, but installing a Web Application Firewall  may block both the attacks and the data that may leak from the site.\n\nLike this article?

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (384, 'WordPress DDoS and other HTTP Reflectors', 'David Hobbs', '2014-3-25', 'Lately,  there has been a lot of buzz about reflection and amplification attacks extending  DDoS harm.  The new kid on this attack  block is NTP.  NTP, or Network Time Protocol, is an amplification attack that is an emerging  form of DDoS.  This attack relies on the  use of publically accessible NTP servers to overwhelm a victim’s system.  While DNS attacks are still an old favorite,  recently there has been a new rash of HTTP-based amplification attacks having a  more significant impact than the past standard network floods.\n\nThere  are two schools of thought when using HTTP Reflectors and Amplifiers. One is to  make your CDN network a weapon for  DDoS, with  the intended injury result of major financial harm.  Similarly Google Docs can be used as a weapon  to just keep loading pages up over and over to help auto-generate a super high  bill.   (http://blog.radware.com/security/2012/05/spreadsheets-as-ddos-weapon/). When you combine a couple  of the ideas together, you can see how easy it is to build a botnet with free online  accounts that automatically can load up pages over and over.\nRecently  a number of folks have begun putting together variations of the Google Docs  Attack with CDN Cache poisoning. Their premise is that they want to bypass the  CDN and hammer the origin server with a heavy load, using Google Docs as the  delivery method. This yielded an impressive 750Mbit flood from just a single  spreadsheet instance. In the other variation, using multiple copies of the same  doc, they could easily run the CDN bill into the ground and mask their activity  by not hitting the origin server. I expect we’ll start to see a variety of  these kinds of perpetual http attack reflectors in the future with some using  CDN as a financial weapon and others using it as a technical weapon.\nThe  WordPress DDoS exploit is another easy to use exploit.   It requires a simple command from a shell  such as:\n\n$ curl -D –   \"www.anywordpresssite.com/xmlrpc.php\" -d  ‘<methodCall><methodName>pingback.ping</methodName><params><param><value><string>http://www.sitetoattack.com</string></value></param><param><value><string>www.anywordpresssite.com/postchosen</string></value></param></params></methodCall>’ \n\nThe “XMLRPC” pingback  function is inherent in WordPress. It’s a feature. Hackers have figured out  ways to get the pingback function to attack other people’s sites. They can  choose one of two versions if the site to attack uses a CDN. First is to bypass  the CDN and use random URL strings to bypass the CDN and hit the origin server.  Second is to simply allow object cache hits which can cause financial costs to  the customer as providers charge unit costs for traffic. \nLuckily the WordPress  exploit requires data to post in the request, or it could be used in the  GoogleDocs exploit.   However, it  probably won’t take long for people to learn about the API’s at Google open for  folks to use in order to create these kind of “self licking ice cream cones”  for DDoS. No botnet is required.\nNow, imagine if somebody  had 15-20,000 fake Facebook accounts and decided to paste “links” to your web  page from all of those accounts?  These  links would cause a heavy page load from their fetch engine as it  gets a number of the images from the page to use as an icon. Facebook now would be  hyper loading your pages.  Or even worse,  they learned how to use the Text/SMS gateway nefariously for Facebook to  automatically post Facebook posts from SMS and use free SMS services? The list  of reflection possibilities is endless.       \nThe difficulty in  fighting these types of attacks is that incorrect defense mechanisms are put  into place. DDoS services that require you to “swing” your datacenter traffic  over to them to “clean” the traffic are expensive, and generally only used for emergencies.  Network reflection attacks often require these kinds of Emergency Services such  as Radware’s Defense Pipe.   When HTTP  reflectors and perpetual HTTP requests come in, on premise is mandatory.   \nWhat happens when  somebody launches embedded queries into Google Docs?  It bypasses the CDN (if you have one), and  hits the database. If this is constant, it can add latency which costs money  and can even decrease revenue if it were an eCommerce siteby slowing down pages  and forcing people to leave your site. When a hacker tunes an attack to the  point where it increases your latency and raises cost in bandwidth, do you  swing traffic to your DDoS service? What does that do for latency?\nThese are some of the  reasons why you’d be foolish to put multiple point solutions together in an  attempt to stop it. Having a DDoS Protection Service in place to help stop DDoS attacks can help mitigate  these kinds of threats.   \n\nLike this article?

Asymmetric  in nature, a DNS flood generates a massive network flood using limited  resources and IP spoofing.  This can make  it very difficult to track. \nWhat are the Mechanics of a  Reflective DNS Attack?\nThe attacker sends DNS requests to 3rd party servers, using a spoofed source IP of the target victim server. The replies sent by 3rd party servers generate an attack on the victim with responses that are x3-100 times amplified compared to the request.\nReflective Floods uses a two-step process to launch an attack: \n\n\nFirst, a large number of requests are sent to  one or more DNS servers. The requests use a spoofed source IP of the target  victim.\n\n\nNext, the DNS server receiving the requests  replies to the spoofed IP, and unknowingly launches an attack on the target  victim by responding to requests that the victim never sent. The target victim  whose resources are exhausted, need not be a DNS server, but can be any server  at all.\n\n\nAnother contributor to the  destructiveness is message amplification. \nMessage amplification is when an attacker sends a small number of short  requests that result in the replies sent by the DNS server to be greatly  amplified, also exhausting the victim’s server resources. \nThis can be best illustrated by a simple equation:\nAssume an attacker with a 5Mbps internet  connection can send about 14k requests of the size 44 bytes per second. This  small size of this request (14k RPS5Mbps) would not cause harm to any normal  DNS server.\nHowever, if the attacker has a  crafted reply with the maximum size of 4096 bytes, the victim server will receive  ~465 Mb of traffic beyond its normal traffic bandwidth.  \nOnly three such attackers are needed to reach  a 1.4Gbps attack throughput. This will cause almost any service to immediately reach  a denial of service state.\nHow Can You Protect Yourself  from these Attacks?\nThe mechanics of Reflective DNS Attacks require that you defend  yourself both from being an attack victim and an unknowingly assistant to  attackers. \nHere are some protection guidelines:\nAwareness\nAny organization with internet access can be a  target for DDoS attacks.  The most  fundamental element of a  protection plan should be constant network monitoring. \nConfigure your DNS Server\nTo prevent a case of your DNS server  being used for an attack, make sure you do not run an open DNS service.  Another precaution is to rate limit responses  from any single authoritative name servers.   Determine the baseline of how many responses you usually get and set a  limit that drops responses when the rate is above this baseline.\nProtect your Pipeline\nThe  above protection methods are all important, but they will not prevent the  saturation of your network pipe in the case of a massive attack.  Make sure you have the option to divert  traffic to an MSSP or another entity offering such services.  In the case of a pipe-saturation attack, your  on-premises equipment will have no way of mitigating the attack by itself.\nSource IP Validation\nFinally, the real solution to IP spoofing is  source IP validation.  Note:  This should be handled by backbone providers,  rather than individual organizations.\n\nLike this article?

According to the story, the Target security team reviewed and ignored urgent warnings about unknown malware spotted on their network. They simply made the wrong call. This can happen, but this erroneous call, ended up resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenues to the organization as well as exposed the personal and credit information of millions of their shoppers.\n\nDespite Target’s security systems alerting two different on-call security teams, one in Bangalore and one in Minneapolis, the action taken was inaction. In a written response, a Target spokeswoman commenting on the security team’s decision said that, “based on their interpretation and evaluation of that activity, the team determined that it did not warrant immediate follow up.” Also important to note:  Target, consisting of 1,600+ stores in 48 states, had invested millions of dollars during the twelve months preceding the breach to build this top-notch enterprise network security system.\nWhat we can learn from this story?\nConsidering the transaction load that successful retailers and e-retail sites can receive, missing an occasional threat is, indeed, human. Hackers, however, understand this vulnerability. The more-sophisticated attackers have been known to add extra traffic to a site using DDoS attacks. This increases the likelihood that they can hide their more malicious activities better among the extra load on the site. But can an error, in the case of an ignored security alert, be avoided? Yes.\nThe integration of detection and protection tools within a single control/orchestration layer is a revolutionary approach that helps to counter the risk of human error. With this approach, the control layer does more than just report. It makes actionable items and then decides (within fractions of a second) what the best protection approach is and then immediately implements it.\nAs cyber attacks continue to rise with more complex, multi-vector campaigns, this can challenge any enterprises’ ability to protect their network and customer information.  By automating mitigation and selecting the most effective tools and locations – aided by human effort and expertise – enterprises can offer the most complete protection for their network in the data center, at the perimeter or in the cloud.  To err is human, but to automate — secure.\n\n\nLike this article?

Because the cyber threats of yesterday were distant notions to the everyday common citizen.  Businesses accosted by “cyber burglars” and threatened infrastructure of foreign countries weren’t and still aren’t relatable by everyone.  This new threat hits home and is as real as the threat of terrorism the U.S. felt on Sept. 11th.\n\nThe following is the text listed by the US Gov’t on the Boeing 777 aircraft:  “These special conditions are issued for the Boeing Model 777-200, -300, and -300ER series airplanes. These airplanes, as modified by the Boeing Company, will have novel or unusual design features associated with the architecture and connectivity of the passenger service computer network systems to the airplane critical systems and data networks. \nThis onboard network system will be composed of a network file server, a network extension device, and additional interfaces configured by customer option. The applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for this design feature. These special conditions contain the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the existing airworthiness standards.” \nSimply stated:  the threat to an aircraft from a cyber attack has not been made part of the requirements for the airworthiness of modern day airliners. \nGiven that cyber attacks have become common and have even affected uranium enrichment centrifuges. (e.g. Stuxnet virus), why and how have we reached this conclusion?  Shouldn’t modern day commercial aircrafts be tested for cyber security vulnerabilities prior to granting airworthiness certificates? \nIn case you’re thinking that we have some time to come up with compensating controls as the threat environment would need to change dramatically for these perceived threats to come together, there was a demonstration during the enormously popular trade-show crucible called “Blackhat.” Using approximately $1,000 of radio equipment, a security researcher demonstrated how an airplane’s signal to an air traffic controller could be “spoofed.” \nSecurity professionals have long understood the threat that embedded systems create for modern day critical infrastructure.  We need to test and protect these systems and it’s high time to drive these processes into modern day transportation vendors to ensure public safety.\n\n\nLike this article?

With these new  companies you can summon a car with just the push of a button often at a lower  expense than a taxi.  Automatic payment  adds even more convenience AND drivers keep their cars clean, all in hopes of a  5 star ratings.  Other feature benefits  include driver and passenger rating systems, customer service and even map  images on the receipt for the route taken.   These companies consider themselves technology companies and not car services and  these TNC applications and services are gaining market share very quickly.\nSeattle just recently joined the ranks  of cities looking to ban these new efficient and economical services.  It seems consumers and companies have  practically declared war on them.  That’s  interesting to me.  Why would such a  fragile cyber security industry, like the taxi industry, make such strong  moves?  What would happen if activists  and/or hacktivists decided to attack them?  TNC companies are probably better positioned  to survive such cyber war assaults whereas the taxi industry, well they might  not make it.\nBecause Taxi companies are extremely weak in defense, many attack  vectors exist against them.  \n TNC  companies create user accounts that gather payment and identity information,  taxis don’t.  An angry rideshare customer  can call taxi companies and send them to remote locations just for “fun”, the  taxi company will arrive and find no fare waiting.  Companies like Uber have automatic billing  for cancellations and use GPS in the app to show the user’s location.  Rideshare companies:  1, Taxis:   0.  \n If  hacktivists like Anonymous decide to call blitz or to TDoS (Telephony denial of  service) a taxi company, victims could lose their traditional phone systems and  call centers.  Rideshare companies do  most of their requests over the internet and authenticate their users, so if  they have DDoS protection, this type of attack won’t affect them.  Taxi companies would all need to switch to  VOIP systems and put TDoS protection in place to keep this from happening.  The new mobile based malware and  botnets are  an additional platform for TDoS.  Groups  like Anonymous have used these attack vectors against other targets and it is  something else that the taxi companies would need to be aware of and prepare  for.  Rideshare companies:  2, Taxis:   0.   \nIf the war escalates, another nefarious attack surface is this.\n Anyone  can go and buy a “burn phone” or prepaid cell from a convenience store and then  request a phone number port from the mobile phone company website.  Instead of porting their own phone number, they  could request to port the taxi company’s number.  This is illegal, yet some fake number porting requests  have slipped through the system on occasion.  Per the FCC rules on number portability,  attackers could steal the taxi company’s phone numbers temporarily.  Although port fraud can be reversed, it can  take up to several days.  Rideshare  companies, which primarily operate over the internet with authenticated users,  again wouldn’t be as devastated by this attack type as a taxi company would.  Rideshare companies:  3, Taxis:   0.   \n Taxi  companies may have powerful influence to lobby the government, but even if they  succeed in pushing out their internet-based competitors; their risk for cyber  retaliation is very great and very real.   The taxi companies that are against this new and growing transportation  service are throwing heavy stones from their glass houses.  \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Attacks\', \'Botnets\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2014/03/rsa-2014-taxi-wars/');

Probably website outage.\nThis image has been crafted over the last couple of years with media, analysts and bloggers all talking about Denial of Service attacks, but mostly when the result of the DoS attack caused a site outage.  Our latest report, the Radware Global Application and Network Security Report addresses this and other misconceptions about DDoS.\n\nAccording to the report, most Denial of Service attacks, 60% of them, result with degradation of the service level and slowness of the application or external web site.  Only 27% result in a complete outage. \nService level degradation is the quiet enemy of web operators and information security groups.  As opposed to the noisy nature of service outages and the media attention associated with it, attacks that result in service level degradation generally go below the public radar.  In some cases even below the radar of the IT department.  However, this website/web application slowness does not go unnoticed by your site users and customers.  According to a Walmart internal study from 2012, for every 100 milliseconds of degradation in their service, revenues declined by about 1%.  This means that the quiet enemy of service level degradation can easily become your website’s quiet killer.\nThe Radware Global Application and Network Security Report also defines a new set of attacks that have gained popularity over last year.  In the report, we group them together as “Web Stealth” attack vectors and we predict the use of these attack types to increase in 2014. \nWeb Stealth attacks are a set of DoS/DDoS attacks that are characterized by one (or more) of these attack vectors: \n\nHaving Dynamic IP addresses (sometimes even behind CDNs)\nHigh distributed attacks\nAttacks with the ability to pass Challenge/Response  \nAttacks that use low-traffic volume but saturate servers’ resources\n\nOne of the most common Web Stealth attack vectors is the Login Page attack.  With a DDoS oriented Login Page attack, the attacker is not interested in gaining access to the site, nor stealing user credentials, but rather they create fake login transactions in hopes of saturating the service. \nAnother trend examined in this report edition is that of using DDoS as a protesting tool in geo-political scenarios.  We’ve seen this trend in all 3 years that our annual report has been published and this 2013 report is not any different.  From Operation Ababil to the nuclear crisis in North and South Korea and extending until the present day riots in Ukraine, hackers have managed to create attacks that cause outages or major slowdowns to a victim’s site. \nThe full 2013 Global Application and Network Security report can be accessed through registration here. \n\n\nLike this article?

A hacker group with the name “DERP” was attacking many of the  Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) sites over the last couple of days. \n\n While DERP suggests that the group is using Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) which is a well-known  DDoS attack tool used in various  attacks  (e.g.: Operation PayBack),  and while it  is a fair to assume that DERP uses a number bots for the attacks, the exact  attack tools being used are not clear.  DERP  suggests that it is attacking the login servers, which make sense, as these  servers are more susceptible to attacks than the application servers in such  sites.\n\nProviders of online games have faced a large number of DDoS  attacks the last couple of months. As these sites are usually an opulent source  of users’ private information (passwords, email addresses and also payment  information), cyber criminals trying to hack such sites to get control of this  sensitive private information. While some of these data harvesting attacks are  done silently,  some use Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks as a way to distract IT  administrators of these sites from the real target of the attack. This type of  distraction technique is similar to the 20th century military combat  doctrine that used massive artillery strikes in one area to cover surgical commando  operations in another. Criminal attackers targeting financial services are  commonly using DDoS attacks for exactly the same reasons.\n It is unclear if the DERP DDoS attacks are just “artillery  cover” for other hidden cybercrimes.  Looking  at its Twitter account name DERP suggests that it is just trolling. But if you  read the Tweets it posts, there is something completely opposite of that. Although  it is against the interest of uncaught criminals to discuss their activities in  public (and DDoS attack is a criminal act), we saw different hacking  groups going public before they attacked their targets. The hacking group Anonymous  is famous in announcing their attacks post-attack or while they are happening, as  found in many of their posted YouTube videos. The Twitter conversation that  took place on the last couple of days was even stranger than that. DERP, was  having live conversations with some of its more than 40,000 Twitter followers, and  even getting requests to take servers down.\n \n  \n  \nInterestingly enough, as the number of followers grew at a rate  of close to 1,000 new users per hour, there were some that tried to imitate DERP  activities by taking down non-gaming websites:\n \nAs the massive attack passed its third day, I’m hoping that  DERP will stop disrupting the online gaming industry. I’m sure there are many  kids out there (my daughter included) who really miss their Club Penguin  character.\n\n\nLike this article?

The breach impacted customers who shopped in their U.S. stores from November 27th to December 15th according to a public statement made on their corporate website.\n\nNow, letâs put this into perspective because 40 million people is a pretty significant number. This is more than the population of California. Imagine swiping everyoneâs credit card info from San Diego to Eureka. This is massive. \nThis data breach also shows the type of hacker we could be facing: someone, or possibly a team of hackers, intelligent enough to launch this during the busiest shopping season. You just donât decide one day to hack into a large retailerâs system that holds the credit card information of its valued customers. This was definitely a well-planned and well-coordinated system breach.  \nThe giant retailer suggests that you monitor your statements for fraudulent activity and even contact each of the three major credit reporting agencies for copies of your credit report. This may remedy the situation, but unfortunately, it doesnât eliminate it.\nBut can this problem even be eliminated? Can we build a better mouse trap? \nIn Europe and over 130 different countries, âChip and PINâ security on credit cards is the standard. There is no magnetic strip where information can be âskimmedâ as the card has an embedded microchip that requires you to insert it into the merchantâs reader and enter a PIN. \nAccording to Bank of America, this type of card is much harder to copy or counterfeit. Some U.S. banks offer this type of technology, but primarily for customers who travel abroad where the Chip and PIN system is widely used. It hasnât been implemented here in the States because of cost. It requires an entirely different new card reader, so rolling out Chip and PIN technology would cost over $5 billion dollars, and footing this bill would not be the credit card issuers, but the merchants. \nPerhaps this is the new mousetrap that weâve been waiting for? Unfortunately, due to an existing system that has been in place for years, as well as the exorbitant cost of changing such a system, weâre held back from defeating this type of threat. The fact is â youâll need a significant credit card theft that will offset the cost of implementing an entirely new system throughout the U.S. for the industry to change. \nInformation theft is a huge thorn for both credit card companies and banks. Itâs also a larger thorn for those who fall victim, as they directly experience loss of money, spend countless hours to constantly monitor credit reports for activity, etc. As other countries have adopted newer technology to combat credit card theft, this by default makes the U.S. the âlow hanging fruitâ for criminals to focus on.\nSo, until we can build that better mouse trap, Iâm sure weâll be hearing more about these types of breaches in the future. One can at least hope theyâre not one of the 40 million Target customers impacted by this latest breach and will hopefully have a better holiday.

Recently, close to 840,000 individuals may have had their personal information compromised including some “clinical” information through the theft of two company laptops owned by a large medical insurance company.\n\n Although much has been made about loss of financial data, I haven’t seen much emphasis on the ways in which a nefarious actor could leverage the acquisition of someone’s health information.\n In general, most people seem to have a strong aversion to sharing their medical records publically.  Numerous reasons come to mind which may drive this behavior. Concerns that it could possibly affect insurance eligibility, ability to maintain or gain employment, and/or it could be that they do not wish to reveal possible “embarrassing” physical or psychological medical conditions, as well as treatments.\nMedical data is rife with clues which reveal other details about one’s personal life such as eating, fitness and lifestyle habits and perhaps some genetic resident diseases.  This provides a somewhat unique attribute for those who are interested in causing directed harm against a fellow person.Â  \nMedical information loss can be monetized or leveraged in numerous nefarious ways such as the following: \n\nThe ability to create a false ‘avatar’ to gain access to medical insurance or payments\nThe ability to sell information on ones’ medical record – – this can be especially valuable if the person is in the public eye or otherwise in a public ‘trust’ position (e.g. Judge, high ranking official, celebrity, etc.)\nThe ability to leverage the information against a person – – e.g. psychological reviews if revealed might jeopardize a person’s very employment.\n\nOrganizations have a fiduciary responsibility to keep sensitive information secure.

In fact, I still hear today an incredible amount of dismissive words to ascribe the attacks as ânuancesâ or âdisturbances,â which is clearly anything but the case for the organizations that are battling the attacks and tallying the financial losses of such events.\n\nIf you sift back, whether through cyber-attacks or operational mishaps, this year has brought us the following:\n\nThe first meaningful outage at Google â August 2013\nOperational outages at nearly every major commercial U.S. Bank â September 2012 – Present\nMultiple outages at one of the worldâs largest newspapers â the New York Times â August 2013\nHours-long outage at the NASDAQ during the trading day â August 2013\nScientific reports and FDA warning that medical devices can be attacked and could conceivably lead to death – June 2013\nA âhackerâ industry nurtured with at least four massive hacking-collectives or memes formed, which are as follows:\n\nGroup Anonymous \nSyrian Electronic Army\nIzz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters\nAnonGhost (Group Anonymous Offshoot)\n\n\nIn many ways, this reminds me of the attacks on Pearl Harbor during World War II, in which a constant drumbeat of signs should have alerted us to trouble. The possibility of an air attack was never questioned, weaknesses in our defense were used to the enemyâs advantage, there were strong motives for the U.S. to be attacked and our resources were compromised. \nWith that sentiment in mind, it is important to note that things could become much worse and the forecast amongst the people fighting in the field is not good. Here are five reasons for concern:\n\nReason #1: It CAN be done\nPlanning the attack on Pearl Harbor took meticulous preparation. As in all warfare, one of the most difficult challenges in attempting to attack an intended victim is the following:\n\nCan it be done?\nIf so, what resources do I need, what are the terms and under what conditions?\nWhat are the consequences â does it have the desirable affect and effect?\n\nThe most impressive change in todayâs landscape is that the most complex, technical environments of the world have not yet built-in the sort of redundancy to ensure, without a reasonable doubt, that they will not go offline. As a result, those who plot to exploit these weaknesses have hope.\n\nReason #2: Weaknesses can be exploited\nAfter an organization is attacked, there are a cacophony of questions and demands for answers from numerous constituents as to what exactly occurred and how. Although on the surface, these questions are sound and mostly well-meaning, the more transparent a company is about the attack, it ironically creates a âroadmapâ for any future perpetrator of an outage.\nYes, the irony is that ALL outages, regardless of origin, now represent a vulnerability that can be leveraged across the world as these, often simple steps become the new mastermind plan to take down a targeted organization.\n\nReason #3: Motives are robust\nAlthough the means to execute cyber attacks exist, without motive there is no will and often no real risk. I think few can argue that motives are increasingly logarithmic, as these new âweaponsâ now represent fantastic new tactics in age-old struggles, such as major ideological conflicts spread throughout the world, while also providing new opportunity for those interested in classic financial gain or personal fame. One only has to see the rise of Hacktivist organizations to see this clearly playing out.\n\nReason #4: Cyber-attack defensive resources are still lacking\nCombine means and motive with a psyche that still views the threat trivially, and you have an environment rife for exploit. Although many have been humbled over the past eighteen months at the ire of some of these organizations have been brought to bear, they are the exception, not the rule. Todayâs information security professionals, business executives and regulatory bodies have proven themselves to be lethargic at best in moving quickly into identifying these new threats, sounding the alarms, and applying proper resources accordingly. Whole industries are struggling to keep up mentally, financially and technically. \n\nReason #5: Only one âSucker-Punchâ can rule!\nPearl Harbor taught us a lot about the stirring threat, which marshaled the U.S. into World War II.  However it cost the U.S. dearly to learn the lesson of that sucker-punch. However, a cyber Pearl Harbor event could be very different in numerous ways, such as:\nIf executed, it may be permanent for huge audiences, perhaps all (instead of just a few).\nCould it be that perpetrators have learned these lessons and understand the wrath of retaliation? It is very likely that if an adversary was to unleash a cyber âsucker-punch,â finally allowing the world to see the ugliness of the threat we confront, that the threat would understand the value of making the attack permanent. That is, to not allow for a momentary attack, but something more permanent and longer-lasting.\n\nIt could be anonymous and conceivably successful\nUnlike Pearl Harbor, this type of attack could be perpetrated with a great degree of anonymity. Even if the evidence points strongly in one direction, the ability to introduce doubt in this attack will be a very attractive feature for a perpetrator. Also, this type of attack could quite possibly achieve the intended results of the perpetrator(s) â also increasing the likeliness of the attack being levied.\n\nAll is not dire. We have not reached condition red\nItâs not time to start building your bunker or huddling under your desk with your hands over your head and neck, however it is high time to become very sober about the threats we face and begin very real, and very necessary steps to both protect and prepare for these risks. Ironically, the more we prepare, the less likely these events will pass!\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attack\', \'ddos\', \'Hacking\', \'Pearl Harbor\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/12/electronic-pearl-harbor/');

Either use an automated technical solution (this is the new term PCI  Security Council gives to Web Application Firewalls) to protect the merchant’s  publicly facing Web applications, or alternatively, merchants can review all of  their public-facing web applications with vulnerability security assessment  tools and ensure that there are not known vulnerabilities. \n Here lies the difference between theory and reality. PCI  requires merchants to review their web-applications after each change (or at  least once annually). This turns this vulnerability assessment and fixing  solution into a non-practical solution. To better understand this let’s refer to  the 2013  WhiteHat Web Site Security Statistics Report. 91% of e-retail sites that  were analyzed for the survey had at least one serious vulnerability. On average,  e-retail web sites had 106 serious vulnerabilities per year. The most  interesting data-point from this report is that it took 224 days to fix these vulnerabilities. \n This has several implications. If it takes 224 days to fix  these vulnerabilities, this means that for almost 2/3 of the year the site is  vulnerable to attacks and is not compliant with PCI-DSS requirements. More  importantly, reading further in the WhiteHat’s report, we find out that 60% of  the e-retailers change their applications once a month and 40% of e-retailers update  their sites once a week or more. This means that it takes more than seven  months to fix the vulnerabilities, while applications are changing,  which in turn, can potentially create new  vulnerabilities on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. \n Don’t get me wrong. I’m all for secure development of web  sites and applications. I feel web sites should be scanned for vulnerabilities  and once found, they should be fixed. However, this can be a little complicated.  If you are part of the security group on the retailer’s side, you are not  always aware of changes the application team is making. Even if you are aware,  the code is sometimes written by a third party or it is a legacy code that no  one knows how to change it anymore. \n The bottom line: Building your web-site security  infrastructure on vulnerabilities scanning and fixing is not practical. Making  your PCI-DSS compliance rely on these scanning and fixing may cause your  company not to pass PCI-DSS audits and not to comply with the regulation. \n Complying with PCI-DSS requirements for secure Web  applications (requirement 6.6) and securing your web application only has one practical  solution: Web Application Firewall (or to follow the new term used by the PCI  Security Council – “automated technical solution.”) All WAF solutions offer web  protection at the application level, most of them comply with the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten Threats, and they  all offer a combination between Positive and Negative security models.  \n On the other hand, WAF solutions are known to consume lots  of application management resources (that’s you and your workers). This is  where the difference between a practical WAF solution and a not so practical  one lies. One of the key selection criteria for your next WAF solutions should  be the ability to automatically adapt the solution’s protection policies  without human intervention and with as low as possible false-positives and  false negatives.\n With so many rapid changes, the automatic ability to adapt  the WAF policies is the only way to ensure that your site is protected even as  it is evolved and changed, without investing too many resources in keeping its  security mechanisms up to date. It allows alignment of the Web application life  cycle development process with the protection process. It ensures that the web  application security is applied in a timely manner and enables protection while  applying new changed.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Compliance\', \'OWASP\', \'PCI\', \'PCI-DSS\', \'WAF\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/11/securing-your-web-site-the-wild-goose-chase/');

The promise on its Twitter profile couldn’t  be clearer: “We write it. We manage it. You never  worry about Wikipedia again.“\nThe services that Wiki-PR advertises on its website are a catalog of behaviors  that run completely counter to the principles, rules and etiquette of the  Wikipedia community. Under \"Page Management\" they promise:\n“You’ll have  a dedicated Wikipedia Project Manager that understands your brand as well as  you do. That means you need not worry about anyone tarnishing your image—be it  personal, political, or corporate.”\n  Another section  focuses on \"Crisis Editing\":\n“Are you  being unfairly treated on Wikipedia? Our Crisis Editing team helps you navigate  contentious situations. We’ll both directly edit your page using our network of  established Wikipedia editors and admins. And we’ll engage on Wikipedia’s back  end, so you never have to worry about being libeled on Wikipedia.”\n  We’ve also seen  Yelp work with the Attorney General of New York to perform a sting  operation against companies posting fake reviews  and conducting their own PR and crisis editing on Yelp. Of course, Yelp is no  stranger to being  accused of being its own “PR and crisis editing”  firm.\n  Many of these “PR  firms” have learned to use “article spinners” and aggressive API’s to automate  the writing of the fake reviews and positive “spin” on these review sites.   The challenge many sites that are subject to  face is: How do you determine a real user from an artificial one? \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'API detection\', \'Bots\', \'network security\', \'scrapers\', \'security technology\', \'software bots\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/11/more-bots-and-aggressive-api-abuse/');

Though some threats are easy to identify and mitigate, the unique structure and complexity of mobile networks makes security threats elusive. In the past, mobile networks enjoyed the privileges of a “Walled Garden” – a closed, isolated ecosystem – under the full control of mobile carriers that used proprietary protocols and had minimal security risks due to restricted user access. They developed their own technologies, standards and interface systems, and were rewarded with security through carefully constructed obscurity. With the introduction of 4G, Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the IEEE standardization of mobile networks, the secure “Walled Garden” days are over.\n\n This post highlights several security concerns of mobile service providers leaving the “Walled Garden”:\n1. Completing the IP Transition\nThe transformation to fully IP-based mobile networks will most likely involve a transition period, during which existing security vulnerabilities will be exposed to a substantially larger audience. Attackers will easily be able to casino online generate attacks targeting mobile endpoints, overlapping network services online casino  between mobile and other networks (such as DNS), and even the core network itself. A full-blown attack on a mobile network has the potential for catastrophic results impacting multiple audiences.\n2. National Infrastructure\nIn today’s hyper connected world, an attack on a mobile network could be viewed as a national infrastructure attack. End user privacy may be dgfev online casino breached; mobile network operators may lose considerable revenues and confidential government data may be exposed. Network operators and providers, as well as government officials, must agree upon and publish usage policies for times of forbearance. We have already had ‘DoS’ issues with mobile networks during terrorist online casino canada and even major sporting events. Setting and delivering traffic priorities is a necessary measure.\n3. Reliance on Open Platforms\n Recently, a great deal has been published regarding the access provided to hackers through Femtocells. This is in part due to the same commoditization of network components. To a generation brought up hacking their personal Linksys WRT54G and manipulating firmware for performance enhancement, the modern Femtocell does not represent a huge challenge. That coupled with the reliance on Linux kernels has lead to an upswing in user device manipulation. As the lines of trust change with network edge devices, attackers will have greater opportunities.\n When it comes to mobile networks, commoditization is the buzzword. The time of Radio STM255 is gone. Now, Gigabit Ethernet and Dark Fibre are the phrases your backhaul engineer responds to. In today’s day and age, mobile networks are becoming very similar to common IP-based networks, along with the abundant and real security threats. However, while common IP network providers have acquired years of expertise and knowhow defending against cyber threats, mobile networks are years behind in terms of that same accumulated security knowledge. Now, more than ever, it’s imperative for mobile security to catch up with the developments in mobile network technology. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'Mobile DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/09/moving-to-mobile-the-changing-face-of-ddos/');

In fact, in most businesses, revenue is ‘chunky’ – that is, most  revenue is derived in very specific moments throughout the year. In fact, many companies rely on a just a few days every  year for their fortunes:\n\nChocolate companies, like Godiva, revolve their  whole business around four holidays including Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day,  Thanksgiving and Christmas\nFast food pizza companies, such as Domino’s and  Papa John’s, rely heavily on sporting events throughout the year for their  revenue, with the Super Bowl representing a lion’s share of revenue generated for  the whole year\nRetailers, in general, derive most of their  yearly revenue from the period between Black Friday and Christmas, which is  known as the Christmas Selling Season. However within that season, Black  Friday, Cyber Monday and Black Saturday represent a high percentage of the  sales for the holiday season\nCharities sometimes have single fundraisers that  define their whole year in terms of donations\n\nSo, now I know that  dates and timing matters to businesses – when’s the optimum time to attack?\nIf a goal of DDoS attacks is to disrupt, disorient, shut down or otherwise silence an intended  victim, why would it not make most sense to focus efforts where an attack would  cause the most harm? Wouldn’t it be more effective to achieve the goals stated  above during timeframes in which the business is at a peak capacity and  requires peak performance, and slight disruptions are meaningfully reverberated  throughout the environment?  \n  In fact, this is no longer conjecture; this is occurring on  a wide scale and needs to be considered in a risk security profile of a  business.

My colleagues will be reporting on their findings, but I wanted to just touch on a few highlights of the conference, some sadness and talk about the value of research.\n \nBarnaby Jack – we missed and continued to miss you. I did not think Black Hat would be the same without him, and I was proved sadly right – he has left an untimely void. My blog post about his untimely death got stuck in an editing hole, so I am including it here.\nBarnaby Jack. Equal parts intelligent, eloquent and mischievous. Many of us thought news of his death was a hoax – he has been at the center of a few, but sadly the news was true. His research was meticulous, his presentations entertaining, he was to so many, an inspiration. Tales of taking ATMs across California and Nevada for his Black Hat presentation had an aura of Hunter S. Thompson about them. So this year, while we were there, many of us, including the Radware Research Team, raised a glass (or three) to him and our shared memories of this remarkable individual. Like many others, I do hope his most recent work is ultimately published. Stars are brightest in their final moments and so I must imagine it will be with Barnaby’s research.\nHighlight number one had to be the timely appearance of National Security Agency director General Keith Alexander. With PRISM still in our collective short-term memory and Edward Snowden gaining temporary asylum in Moscow (I can give him some restaurant advice from my own visits), it takes more than bravado to turn up, but I am not allowed to use the word in the corporate blog. It also took a team of federal agents large enough to overthrow lesser countries to make him secure enough to speak without the threat of egg throwing. Sadly the content was a fairly banal experience, a passable attempt at explaining away the controversy of recent weeks. My congratulations to the hacker shouting “FREEDOM” during the presentation, but it was not up to Mel Gibson’s standards.\nNumber two was however not a session. I saw but a post on the Akamai blog by Bill Brenner, What’s New in Security? Nothing. This was met with much discussion in the booth and with a large number of our CDN partners. I would propose to Mr. Brenner, while not new, fewer organizations consider DNS flipping to be a long-term DDoS strategy and it does nothing for low and slow, SSL and Application centric DDoS. Please do take a look at our very scalable ADC and DefensePro solutions and possibly consider a POC of our Elastic WAF. (Sorry I could not resist)\nThirdly, the work of Karsten Nohl deserves special mention but that is because I am a mobile fan boy. I love my life enabling gadgets (Galaxy Nexus). His work on rooting and exploiting SIM cards is worth a read – please do. \nFinally, my biggest motivation for joining Radware just two months ago was its significant R&D casino  investment. It may not be DARPA money, but it’s an investment mostly in amazing people. We may have bought some really cool traffic generators for the lab as well. So why reference this? One of our researchers attended a phenomenally interesting session, “Ultimate DDoS Mitigation Bypass.” The Bloodspear Research Group put together an enthralling presentation, and presented some excellent ideas. They have created a tool Kill’em All 1.0, which supports the following features:\n\nAuthentication bypass (including re-authentication every X seconds capability)\n HTTP redirect\nHTTP cookie\nJavaScript Challenge bypass\nCaptcha solving\n\nAll told this is a magnificent achievement, and we welcome the publishing of their data. I recommend that CSOs use this tool to test their own defenses. \nBack to BlackHat though – and a message for the organizers. The event has remained true to its origins, the organizers and committees have kept the vendors out of the briefings to a greater extent than before. They are putting more scrutiny in place and this is a good thing, but if I had a criticism, it’s that I have heard submissions that didn’t make it this week as they were considered vendor-centric. The Bloodspear Group is putting out data and raising questions. Our research teams are industrious – we are not just working on today’s issues, we are part of the White Hat community, we are working on tomorrow’s issues. For many organizations, we put our researchers on pedestals – they work for vendors, but their independence is assured. We want them as individuals to be able demonstrate their worth and intellect, to demonstrate we can solve issues such as those shown by Bloodspear – it motivates and inspires them – but when you shackle the bird, it will not sing.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Black Hat\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/08/a-look-back-at-black-hat-staying-true-to-its-roots-but-never-the-same-without-barnaby-jack/');

Some of the scrapers are visitors they wish to allow, like price comparison websites, while others are competitors attempting to get a pricing edge on them. As a result of this trend, many companies have expressed service interruptions, page slowdowns up to 30 seconds per page, web server crashing and loss of revenue.\nAn article in the New York Times noted that during the holidays, most major retailers put strategies in place to undercut their competitors.

With the variable pricing software and intelligence index methods, could your misinformation campaign cause your competitors to make bad decisions? What if you lowered prices below cost, then raised prices sky high to the bots, while keeping your prices low?  Could you change the landscape in your favor? How much does it cost for you to host bandwidth and servers for your competitors?\nWhat technologies are you using to monitor, stop and change this behavior that inevitably hits your website every day?

It is only the large volume of simultaneous requests that turns those legitimate requests into an attack. Consequently, one of the biggest challenges in mitigating DDoS attacks is distinguishing between malicious and legitimate traffic.\n\n Flagging a legitimate user as malicious (false positive) results in the denial of service for legitimate users; conversely, identifying a malicious user as legitimate (false negative) may open the door for additional, undetected cyber-attacks. How then, do DDoS mitigation solutions distinguish between legitimate and malicious users? \nRate limitation is not the way to go\nFirst, Iâll explain why outdated anti-DDoS solutions that base their protection on rate limitation methods cannot address this challenge. \n The rate limit mechanism is based on a pre-defined, static threshold of traffic and has two main drawbacks:\n\n It does not mitigate attacks until the attack traffic reaches the predefined threshold. This results in slow detection of attacks or failure to detect attacks below the threshold.\n Once the rate based mechanism starts to mitigate suspected traffic, it impacts the quality of experience for all users, including legitimate ones. Not every increase in traffic rate is a result of an attack; there are other cases, such as flash crowd events, that look like attacks to outdated anti-DDoS solutions. As a result, the solution can mistakenly block legitimate traffic.\n\nIt is clear that outdated anti-DDoS solutions cannot distinguish properly between attackers and legitimate users. Advanced DDoS mitigation solutions deploy more sophisticated methods, such as behavioral analysis or challenge-response mechanisms to deal with this challenge.\nBehavioral Analysis\nBehavioral analysis follows application transactions and builds an understanding of the application in order to distinguish between legitimate and malicious users. A baseline application behavior is defined after considering both the amount and frequency of events.\n During an attack, data is gathered and compared to the baseline behavior model. If a suspicious behavior is detected, a deeper inspection process is triggered, which analyzes application-level parameters and resolves whether the suspicious behavior is a result of a legitimate burst of application traffic or a result of a malicious application abuse.\n For example, a PDF file in a certain website is normally downloaded 10 times per hour. If the same file is downloaded 1000 times per hour, an attacker may be involved, so further security measures must be taken.\nChallenge Response\nA challenge response (C/R) mechanism sends challenges to suspicious sources and based on the response, determines if the source is a Bot or a real user. An example of a challenge response mechanism is CAPTCHA, which requires the user to type letters and/or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen. The CAPTCHA test prevents unwanted internet bots from accessing websites, since a normal human can easily read the CAPTCHA, while the bot cannot process the image letters.\n To use the C/R mechanism, an attack mitigation system launches a series of queries to the source of a request in question, and according to the responses received, it decides whether to send an additional, more sophisticated challenge, or flag the source as a malicious user. C/R mechanisms use automated processes, and require no human intervention from the mitigation system or from the source. The intelligent usage of a C/R mechanism and network behavioral analysis can almost completely eliminate false positives, guaranteeing an excellent quality of experience for legitimate users.\nIn summary, anyone can rate limit the traffic to a specific application and prevent floods on the applications, but this will result in denying the service from your legitimate users, which was the original objective of the attackers. Only advanced anti-DDoS solutions can successfully distinguish between attackers from legitimate users during an attack and guarantee proper service to online customers.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Baseline Application Behavior\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/06/distinguish-between-legitimate-users-and-attackers-the-secret-sauce-of-ddos-protection/');

This âSoft Warâ has many elements to it, but with the rash of new attacks focusing on producers of electricity, healthcare providers and emergency broadcast and response systems, it wonât be long before this war claims its first real casualty. Similar to severe weather events, itâs possible that these cyber attacks will lead to the loss of life as a result of complications arising from the adverse effects of a âsoft attackâ.\nIt doesn’t take much to imagine the following scenarios arising from a system or power outage as a result of a cyber attack:\n\nInfirmed individuals struggling to maintain continuity of care during either a power or system-level outage\nEmergency responders unable to gain valuable information about the nature of a fast-moving disaster because of a system level hack or outage\nPeople falsely directed to take specific action as a result of cyber attack on the emergency broadcast system\nExtended outages of power, oil and gas production and communications and/or water services\n\n\nHowever, with attacks happening on a daily basis we have become numb to the depth, breadth, speed and efficacy of cyber attacks and systemic breakdowns occurring all around us. Letâs look back at a few that we witnessed over the past year:\n\nThe longest continuous DDoS attacks in history: Operation Ababil against US Commercial Banks\nThe first âin-the-wildâ encrypted DDoS attacks: Operation Ababil\nPolitically motivated cyber attacks: Operation Israel, Operation USA, Operation Turkey\nThe first systemic outage of a tier-one telecommunications provider by a cyber attack: AT&T DNS attack(s) around Aug. 15th, 2012\nLargest oil production cyber attack in history: Oil fields in Saudi Arabia stop producing for two days and thousands of PCs are infected with malicious viruses  \n\nConfronted with these events, information security professionals can respond in one of two ways:  \nThe first option is to wave the proverbial âwhite flagâ and rack up the well-heeled excuses for not getting the hard work that information security requires done. \nThe following is a list of justified reasons often cited by security professionals in response to failing to adequately protect an enterprise: \n\nLack of resources including time, money and available people\nIdentified risks accepted by the business\nLack of knowledgeable people\nLack of access to key technologies/vendors\n\nThe second option is to recognize that the sky is falling, sound the trumpets and head to the âhigh-groundâ.  Yes, sometimes that happens – even if it should rarely be talked about. How else can we explain why the US commercial banks, the largest, most well-resourced and well-staffed companies in the world, are struggling with the current threat landscape? After all, if these strong and heavily fortified institutions fell victim to DDoS attacks, how in the world can more ill-prepared industries such as government agencies, healthcare providers, educational institutions as well energy and manufacturing, be prepared without dramatic and quick change to their security programs?\nIf, like me, you are among the group of paranoid security professionals that make up the second category, how do you go about battening down the hatches and building a much more effective security program? \nWhile it is difficult to say with certainty how these changes in the cyber security landscape will play out, we can make certain assumptions based on the frequency, effectiveness and directed nature of the attacks:\n\nCyber Attacks will Become âNormalâ. That is, we will come to expect an attack whenever the slightest grievance is encountered in our business and daily duties. These attacks will result from macro-level political motivations, like the Middle East conflict, to micro-level grievances such as a quarrel with your next-door neighbor and everything in-between.  Bottom line: Cyber attacks are not a fad. As long as they are effective, they will NOT just go away. \n\nCommon and Not-So-Common Criminals Will Get in on the Cyber-Attack Act. Cyber attacks started out as largely ideologically or politically motivated in nature. However, since the start of 2013 weâve seen a significant increase in common criminals who are leveraging effective attack techniques to either make money or increase competitiveness. Bottom line: Cyber attacks focused on âHacktivismâ will be joined at a massive rate by âFinancially Orientedâ attacks. Perpetrators will become more brazen as they realize how inept the legal system is in dealing with these attacks.\n\nAttacks will Get Very Technical and Encrypted. Taking lessons learned from the US banks attacks, perpetrators understand that systemic technical weaknesses such as SSL-DDoS attacks do exist. Bottom line: If the security model your enterprise is deploying hasnât materially changed since 2005, your organization will be utterly ineffective in fighting todayâs cyber attacks.   \n\nLaws will fail to Meaningfully Address the âFlat Cyber Battlefieldâ. Unfortunately, laws built around a paradigm of domiciles and nation-states donât work well for a world in which these constructs have lost their efficacy. As a result, all of the laws in the world wonât address the problem unless the issue is addressed globally and systemically. Bottom line:  Help from law enforcement will not be available; organizations have largely been left to fight this battle alone. \n\n\nCountermeasures are needed! Defense mitigation strategies are also evolving and now include active counterattack strategies. Bottom line: organizations will become more aggressive in fighting DDoS attacks amidst the increasing need to leverage counter attacks to mitigate threats.\nWhat security changes are you making to effectively deal with the evolving threat landscape?\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber Security\', \'Cyber War\', \'DDoS Mitigation\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/06/killer-apps-or-apps-that-kill/');

The following post goes in-depth to break down why Low & Slow application level attacks are difficult to detect and mitigate.\n\nAppearance of legitimacy\nLow & Slow attacks use slow traffic that appears legitimate in terms of the protocol rules and rates. By not violating any network standard or security policy they pass undetected, flying below the radar of traditional mitigation strategies. \n The traffic, however, is designed to exhaust the victim’s resources until its services halt and become unavailable. For example, a popular Low & Slow attack tool is R.U.D.Y (R U Dead Yet?), which can bring down a web server by creating long form field submissions. This is done by iteratively injecting one byte into a web application post field followed by a sleep period. The result is that application threads become stuck because they are occupied with these one-byte POST fragments.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nSlowloris is another popular Low & Slow attack tool that holds HTTP connections open by sending partial HTTP requests. Slowloris continues to send subsequent headers at regular intervals to occupy the application stack and keep the connections from closing. The web server quickly reaches its maximum application stack capacity and becomes unavailable for new connections by legitimate users.\nLimited resources\nUnlike other denial of service attacks, Low & Slow techniques require very little resources from attackers.  While performing a network flood requires several hundreds of Bot machines that simultaneously send traffic to overload network resources, Low & Slow attacks can be activated from a single attacking computer with no additional bots. \n Detecting Low & Slow application attacks requires real-time awareness of the resources consumed by the protected servers, such as CPU, memory, connection tables, application states (virtual or real ones), application threads and more. \nA resource aware detection solution will constantly monitor the status of resource allocation, as well as trends of the protected servers, and will be able to identify misuse of those resources. For example, long and relativity “idle” open network connections might imply that the server is under a connection table misuse attack. Additionally, an application stuck in a process that is supposed to be completed quickly may be under a R.U.D.Y attack. \n Detecting such attacks requires a tight integration between the protected server and the mitigation solution. Another approach is for the mitigation solution to analyze the behavior of open server connections and to simulate the application stack resources without a direct connection to the server itself.  With the proper behavior analysis technologies, the misuse of the network and application resources can be identified with high accuracy. Once the activity is detected, it can be traced back to its origin and mitigated as necessary.\nIt’s clear that the Low & Slow method upends some of our preconceived notions when it comes to DDoS attacks. From its relative simplicity to its usage of minimal resources, defending against this increasingly popular tactic requires the right security infrastructure along with a dedicated team of security personnel that possesses the expertise to break down the latest attack tools in real time. \nHas your organization been the victim of a Low & Slow attack? If so, share your experiences of how you detected and mitigated this deceptively malicious DDoS attack tool. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'Low & Slow Application Attacks\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/06/why-low-slow-ddosattacks-are-difficult-to-mitigate/');

However, many still believe that the traditional security tools such as firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can help them deal with the DDoS threat. This post explains why organizations should not count on their firewall and IPS when it comes to mitigating DDoS attacks.\n\nEarlier this year, our Emergency Response Team (ERT) released its annual security report based on dozens of DoS and DDoS attacks that occurred in 2012. The report found that in 33% of cases, the firewall and IPS devices were the main bottlenecks during the attack. \n\nWhy can’t firewalls and IPS handle DDoS attacks?\nThe simple answer is that they were not designed to do so. Firewalls and IPS focus on examining and preventing the intrusion of one entity at a time, but were not designed to detect the combined behavior of legitimate packets sent millions of times. Of course, this is a bit simplified. What follows, however, is a more detailed explanation of firewall and IPS shortcomings when it comes to effectively blocking DDoS attacks.\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nFirewalls and IPS are Stateful Devices \nAs stateful devices, firewalls and IPS track all connections for inspection and store them in a connection table. Every packet is matched against the connection table to verify that it was transmitted over an established, legitimate connection. \nThe typical connection table can store tens of thousands of active connections, which is sufficient for normal network activity. However, a DDoS attack may include thousands of packets per second. As the first device in the organizational network to handle the traffic, the firewall or IPS will open a new connection in its connection table for each malicious packet, resulting in the quick exhaustion of the connection table. Once the connection table reaches its maximum capacity, it will not allow additional connections to be opened, ultimately blocking legitimate users from establishing connections.\nDDoS mitigation devices, on the other hand, include a stateless protection mechanism that can handle millions of connection attempts without requiring connection table entries or exhausting other system resources.\nFirewalls and IPS Cannot Distinguish Between Malicious and Legitimate Users\nCertain DDoS attack vectors such as HTTP floods, are composed of millions of legitimate sessions. Each session on its own is legitimate and it cannot be marked as a threat by firewalls and IPS. The problem of course is that firewalls and IPS were not designed to look at the behavior of millions of concurrent sessions as a whole, but only to examine individual sessions. This eliminates the ability to identify an attack composed of millions of valid requests.\nFirewalls and IPS Possess an Inappropriate Network Location\nFirewalls and IPS solutions are deployed too close to the protected servers and are not deployed as the first line of defense. However, this is precisely where DDoS attacks should be mitigated. The result is that DDoS attacks go through the protected data center without being detected by the traditional network security solutions. A dedicated DDoS mitigation solution, on the other hand, would be deployed even before the access router at the ISP hand-off, enabling the early detection of an attack.\nThere is no doubt that the increasing use and sophistication of DDoS attacks has fundamentally changed the security landscape. As organizations adjust their security architecture to effectively mitigate the rise in availability-based attacks, there is no question that the tools they deploy must continue to evolve as well. While firewalls and IPS continue to play an important role in protecting the network, today’s threats require a holistic solution that can secure the network and application’s layers, as well as effectively distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate traffic to keep organizations up and running. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'Firewall\', \'Intrusion Prevention Systems\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/05/can-firewall-and-ips-block-ddos-attacks/');

The Ponemon  Institute study estimates that the average cost of one minute of downtime  due to a DDoS attack is $22,000. With an average downtime of 54 minutes per DDoS  attack, this amounts to a heavy toll. Obviously, the costs depend on  several variables, such as your business segment, the volume of online business,  competitors, and your brand.\n\nHere are a few pointers for assessing the quantitative and  qualitative business impacts of a DDoS attack.\nFinancial losses\nDirect revenue losses depend on the industry, but organizations  that rely on the Internet for business suffer the most. The graph below from  the Ponemon study outlines the estimated cost per minute of downtime for three  different industries. The estimated cost includes lost traffic, end user  productivity, and lost revenues. As can be seen, financial service  organizations experience the highest costs, followed by organizations within  the health & pharmaceuticals industry and the public sector industry. \n\nAttackers often plan the timing of their attack in order to maximize  financial damage. For instance, online retailers would likely be targeted  during the heavy traffic of holiday shopping seasons. Beyond lost revenue, financial  losses may include other elements, such as the cost of investigating and responding to an attack, expenses  related to customer support and public relations, and potentially even  financial penalties or lawsuits. \nPublic information about the exact expenses related to DDoS  attacks is limited. One known example is the wave of DDoS attacks that targeted  Yahoo and Amazon in 2000, which was estimated to have a cost over $1.2 billion  in damages. Sony spent more than $170M on cleanup related to a DDoS attack and  loss of data. Some analysts estimate the costs to be even higher, amounting to  billions of dollars in damages. Regardless of the exact figure, there is no  doubt that the cost incurred by a DDoS attack can be exorbitantly high.\nReputational Damage\nWhen asked about the most negative consequences of a cyber  intrusion, organizations rank reputational damage third, following intellectual  property at number one and productivity losses at number two.\n\nPublic news about your company falling victim to a  cyber-attack and thus, compromising customer data, is always bad news. The  ensuing bad publicity can be limited, but it may also have serious effects on  reputation and future sales. Regaining the trust of the public, press, and  customers takes longer and always requires much effort.\nCustomer Attrition\nOnline customers have high expectations in regard to quick  access to information. According to Microsoft, a customer will be less likely  to visit a website if it is slower than a competitor site by more than 250  milliseconds. Likewise, it is not surprising that a customer who cannot readily  reach a website for information, services, or purchases becomes unsatisfied. This  category of customer complains, requests financial restitution, or simply switches  to a competitor altogether. \nLegal Pursuits\nCustomers that can prove they suffered damages by the  unavailability of online services may pursue financial restitution by filing  lawsuits, arguing that the company did not take enough precautions against the  possibility of attacks. In one example, a major stock exchange hit by a DDoS  attack in 2011 was forced to suspend trading and pay penalties to trading firms  to compensate for their inability to provide normal service.\nWhile the overall business impact of a DDoS attack is  difficult to estimate, it is always costly – in financial losses, reputational damage, and customer attrition. Protecting your network  against a DDoS  attack is much safer, from both a security and a monetary standpoint. \n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cost of Downtime\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/05/how-much-can-a-ddos-attack-cost-your-business/');

In fact, an attack usually starts slowly and itâs only as the attack progresses that someone takes notice. But what does a DDoS attack look like from the inside? What are the early warning signs? Who are the principle players? What steps are taken to mitigate an attack? What tensions and emotional responses does an attack produce at the various levels of an enterprise? In the following post, a system administrator of a bank provides an hour-by-hour break down of the early stages of a DDoS attack as experienced in real time.\n\n5:30 a.m.\nI am awakened by the sound of an incoming SMS message on my phone.  The message, an automatic notification sent by our new server health monitoring tool reads: âWarning, Mainapp server at 30% maximum load.â Mainapp is the principal online banking application web-server that handles customer requests.\nSince our CEO has strategically decided to promote online banking, the bank has invested a great deal of money to ensure that the Mainapp banking application web-server is robust, scalable, and highly available. So far, itâs had enough processing power and memory to handle current traffic levels. With last monthâs statistics indicating a server load of no more than 15%, receiving a message that the server load is at 30% is worrisome, but not serious.  \nAt this point, I think itâs possible that the monitoring toolâs alert threshold parameters were set incorrectly, but I can wait to check that when I get to the office later.\n6:00 a.m.\nOnly a half hour later another SMS message arrives. This one reads âWarning, Mainapp server at 50% maximum load.â Something is definitely wrong. But since I didnât configure remote access to the health-monitoring tool, I canât look at its logs until I get to the office.  \nWhile rushing to get to the office to investigate, I run through the possible causes of such high server load. I try to assure myself that itâs probably a simple configuration error, but Iâm beginning to worry.  \n7:00 a.m.\nThe customer support manager on duty calls me to report that many customers are complaining that the online banking website is significantly slower than normal. He says that one of the customers is furious because he was unable to perform a time-sensitive money transfer as quickly as usual.\n\nFinally I arrive at the office and rush to a server terminal screen.  Mainappâs load has reached 70% â nearly maximum capacity.  \nUpon a quick check of the health monitoring tool logs, I find out that the alert thresholds are set correctly. However, online banking traffic still appears to be abnormally high. Thousands of connections have been opened to the server, requesting different pages on the online banking website. \nA few beads of sweat drip down my forehead as I try not to panic. Such a massive amount of network traffic must be originating from a malicious source, but why?  Who is behind it? I suddenly remember last weekâs newspaper headlinesâ detailing the wave of cyber attacks on financial service institutions. I begin to see similarities between what our server is experiencing and what I read about in the papers. I fear that our server is being targeted by a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n8:00 a.m.\nAssuming the worst, I try and identify the nature and source of the malicious traffic.  First, I check where the connections are originating from and try to isolate the attackersâ IP addresses in order to differentiate the legitimate from the malicious traffic. Meanwhile, my phone does not stop ringing.\nThe CIO calls wanting to know whatâs going on. I tell him that Iâm trying to solve the problem but that we might be experiencing a denial-of-service attack thatâs exhausting our serverâs resources. His response – the problem needs to be solved quickly, before the CEO gets involved.  \nI have no clue how to stop the attack, and Iâm not even sure that itâs actually DoS. What I do know is that Iâve never seen anything like this in my entire career. My only knowledge on the subject comes from some reading I did on the Internet after attending last monthâs security seminar.\nLooking at the IP trace, it seems like the malicious connections are coming from various sources. Each IP is repeatedly sending HTTP GET requests for various online banking pages. This action is hogging all of Mainappâs resources, making the online banking pages slow for legitimate users. \nWith some idea of what is going on, I decide on a short-term plan of action and call an emergency team meeting.\n8:30 a.m.\nThe situation has not gotten any better. The pace of the attack has been constant, but now Mainapp hardly responds to any kind of request. The customer support manager at my office is upset as all of his staff is being overwhelmed by support calls. Customers are unhappy and angry, but what can he instruct them to say? I tell him that I think we are under attack by one or more hackers, that we shouldnât expect to regain normal service any time soon, and that we may release a formal statement in the near future regarding our downtime.\n9:00 a.m.\nThe situation is now catastrophic. Word has spread and the entire staff is in a state of panic. The emergency meeting I called convenes. It consists of the CIO, CTO, network administrators, security manager, application manager and system administrators. Tension aside, we all understand the importance of issuing an official message to the customers and decide on a plan of action to deal with the attack.\nI show everyone the logs and after a few minutes the security manager notices that some of the malicious requests are coming from Russia. Quickly, I define a rule on the Mainapp web server to reject all requests originating from Russia thinking it may slow down the attack. Unfortunately, it doesnât help. After activating my new filter, I see no decrease in the amount of malicious traffic. Following a brief period with no new connections, additional connections begin to originate from a dozen different countries, including ours!\n9:30 a.m.\nThe server is still under heavy load. Blocking IPs based on geographic region did not help so we have to look for another solution. Since we were not prepared to handle such an attack, it has become necessary to gain a better understanding of how to prevent and mitigate a DoS attack.\n10:00 a.m.\nThe Mainapp web-server is completely flooded and the online banking site is offline.  Upon hearing this news, the CEO decides to get involved. She emphasizes how bad it is for the bankâs reputation to announce such an attack and wonders how much it will cost the bank in revenue loss as well as customer dissatisfaction. Sheâs worried that if the details of this attack leak to the press it could cause panic among the bankâs customers and reiterates that the attack must be mitigated quickly – by whatever means necessary.\n10:15 a.m.\nItâs now clear to me that weâre facing a well coordinated distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that our current security tools cannot mitigate. Although DDoS is a rising security threat, we donât have the right expertise within the organization to deal with something of this magnitude.  \nDoes this scenario sound familiar? If so, share your DDoS experiences and let us know how your organizations are adjusting their security infrastructure to deal with availability-based attacks. \nThe above scenario was originally printed in our âDDoS Survival Handbookâ which can be downloaded for free through our online resource which provides a comprehensive analysis on denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack tools, trends and threats.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DDoS Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/05/what-its-like-to-get-hit-with-a-ddos-attack/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (410, 'Pinpointing the Blame for Cyber Attacks â 3 Reasons Why itâs Harder than you Think', 'Michael Atkinson', '2013-4-26', 'As the cyber security landscape evolves and attacks become more sophisticated and malicious, the question of responsibility has grown increasingly important. Despite the fact that in the wake of high profile cyber attacks charges of blame abound, pinpointing blame for cyber attacks is actually harder than most people think.\n\nOver the course of my career, Iâve had a number of customers ask me to help collect attack data for the purposes of prosecuting those responsible. Unfortunately, savvy attackers have many tools at their disposal to avoid being held accountable for their actions. Below are the three most common tactics that make assessing blame following a cyber attack a difficult task.\nIP Spoofing\nThe Internet Protocol, commonly referred to as IP, is used for practically everything. It was designed for interoperability and survivability in the event that parts of the network were taken offline abruptly. One thing it was not originally designed for was security. Each IP packet has headers that allow routers and other devices to see where the packet has come from and where itâs supposed to be going, among other things. The destination device uses the source IP address information to see where responses should go. Changing those headers is very straightforward.\nWhen attackers falsify the source IP address in a packet header, itâs called spoofing. Itâs easy and very common. For DDoS attacks in particular, the attacker will often create packets with a source IP address belonging to the victim. The intended result is a storm of responses from all over the Internet, slowing or stopping the victimâs legitimate network traffic. At other times packets are sent directly to one of the victimâs IP addresses, with the source addresses belonging to innocent third parties. The limitation of source IP spoofing is that it cannot be used to establish two-way communication, making it unworkable for more sophisticated attacks.\nCompromised Servers\nBefore botnets, it used to be more common for an attacker to remotely compromise a server, either through an operating system vulnerability or by other means. A rootkit would be installed, which is software designed to help attackers hide the evidence of their activities and make it easier for them to regain access if it was lost.\nOnce that was done, attacks could be launched from the compromised server, with the attacker removing logs to cover his tracks. Clever attackers would compromise many servers, hopping from one to another to create a lengthy trail of servers with logs deleted to prevent investigators from discovering the attackerâs origin. System administrators had to become security gurus, installing patches and making configuration changes to protect their systems from attack.\nBotnets\nWith high-speed Internet access no longer limited to servers, workstations become better targets. Theyâre not frequently monitored closely by information security departments and often are not fully patched. In addition, itâs rare for administrators to be willing to spend significant time investigating anomalies on them.\nCreating, managing, renting, and using large groups of infected computers is big business. BotnetsÂ are used for many purposes, including DDoS attacks, network intrusions, distribution of malware, and other cybercrime. The traffic between botnet members and victim networks is often easy to track back to the infected computer, but all that gets you is the victim of the infection. Intercepting the Command and Control traffic then becomes the goal, but smart botnet operators donât send traffic directly from their home computers to the botnet nodes they control.\nCommand and Control traffic typically uses a covert channel, such as IRC, Twitter, IM, or peer-to-peer networking. Command and control servers are often decentralized, and commonly use fast-flux DNS to hide behind constantly changing network of compromised hosts acting as proxies.\nProtecting Your Enterprise\nThe unfortunate truth is that network providers and law enforcement often cannot catch smart cybercriminals. It falls upon individual enterprises to use appropriate policies, procedures and technology to protect themselves. Strong perimeter defense, including Network Behavioral Analysis, DoS mitigation, and IP reputation services, can work in conjunction with application-aware security to provide comprehensive protection.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Cyber attacks\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Protection\', \'IP Spoofing\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/04/pinpointing-the-blame-for-cyber-attacks-3-reasons-why-its-harder-than-you-think/');

Several reports have been published which have positively identified almost 90,000 attacking sources.\nOnce a username and password is successfully guessed by the attacking script, it uses the gained admin credentials to upload a malicious script to the compromised server.\nWhile many of the brute force attempts were unsuccessful in guessing the admin credentials, the high volume of the attacks has caused excessive resource utilization to the servers hosting the WordPress applications, resulting in unresponsiveness to legitimate users for the duration of the attack.\nMitigation Recommendation\nIn order to mitigate the attack, WordPress servers are encouraged to use the following preventive measures:\n\n Enable WordPress’ ‘Two Step Authentication’. \n Hardening security of WordPress configurations. \n Choose a complex and non-common password.\n\nOur ERT team confirmed 2 additional protection methods that may effectively mitigate the attacks.

SDN is all the rage where most L4-L7 vendors will make an effort to show they are part of the game. But eventually most vendors just provide an API for the customer to build their SDN Application – which allows them to claim they have a solution for SDN. \nHowever, Radware provides a set of SDN Applications as well as the APIs and a complete solution that enables us to program the network for security and for ADC (thus enabling the network to deliver increased value.) The result is a transformation of application delivery and security from device-based into network-wide services by utilizing SDN as an enabling architecture.\nNow, allow me illustrate our concept of DefenseFlow™. It is an application developed by Radware that runs on top on any switching vendor SDN controller. Its features include an adaptive behavioral-based DoS attack detection engine and a traffic diversion mechanism that utilizes the programmable characteristics of the software network elements for attack cleansing.\nBy moving attack detection intelligence to the SDN application, DefenseFlow™ can collect network statistics from the data plane without the need to deploy costly hardware detectors – it just programs the SDN controller to define the required data plane statistics to collect. \nUsing these statistics DefenseFlow™ continuously inspects the configured targets for potential network DoS/DDoS attacks in out of path mode. Once an attack is detected, DefenseFlowTM diverts only the suspicious traffic to the nearest mitigation device (DefensePro) by utilizing the programmable characteristics of the software defined network elements for attack cleansing. This means that operators can deploy the mitigation devices from any network location.\nSo, what do network operators gain? Quite a lot. They’ll gain immediate attack detection in seconds rather than minutes – by collecting the most relevant statistics required every second. Low operational cost involved with traffic diversion using native SDN services instead of using tunneling (e.g. GRE, MPLS) and BGP injection.\nThey’ll also gain a lower solution cost overall: Thanks to SDN abstraction services and DefenseFlowTM implementation as an SDN application, there is no need for multiple costly hardware detectors for every network segment (each requiring a router port.) \nTo learn more about DefenseFlowTM and Radware’s SDN strategy, click here. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'DDoS Security\', \'DoS Security\', \'SDN\', \'Software Defined Network\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/04/defenseflow-dosddos-security/');

Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) is currently monitoring the situation closely.\n\n\nAttack motivation\nSimilar to the #OpIsrael attack that took place in November, the motivation for the attack is political. However, while the attack in November took place following clashes between Israeli forces and Gaza militants, this most recent campaign is being launched as a response to what the attackers describe as “Israel’s behavior towards the Palestinian people.”\n\nGroups & Hackers\nMultiple groups and hackers have announced their participation in the attack, including: \n[one_half]\n\nAnonGhost\nAlgerian Hackers\nMauritania HaCker Team\nAjax Team\nMLA\nMoroccan Hackerz\nGaza Hacker Team & Gaza Security Team\n\n[/one_half]\n[one_half_last]\n\nAnonymous Syria\nZHC\nThe Hacker Army\nX-BLACKERZ INC\nDevil Zone Team\nMoroccan Hackers\n\n[/one_half_last]\nIn addition to the list above, the post stated that there are another 15-20 teams who have declared that they will be taking part in the attack as well as a large number of individuals that have made clear that they will be participating from around the world.\nThe Anonymous-affiliated hacker group claims that the April 7th #OpIsrael campaign will be much bigger than the November 2012 attack where hundreds of Israeli websites were targeted. \n\nAttack Targets\nWhile no specific targets were mentioned in the post, previous attacks carried out by some of these groups lead us to believe that the April 7th attack will target government sites as well as Israeli banks and businesses.\n\nAttack Vectors and Tools\nUsing the November 2012 attacks as our guide, there is evidence to suggest that the April 7th #OpIsrael attack will include both DDoS attacks and web site defacements, with each of the teams trying to create the maximum amount of damage based on their capabilities and knowledge.\nTo achieve their stated goal, which is defined as “a total blackout”, it is also possible that a massive DNS attack will be launched on Israeli root domain servers.\nAttack tools that were published are PyLoris and ByteDos, which are two common tools utilized by hackers. \nPyLoris is a slow HTTP DoS tool, which enables the attacker to craft her own HTTP Request headers. These include the packet header, cookies, packet size, timeout and CRLF option.\nPyLoris’ objective is to keep TCP connections between the attacker and the victim servers open for as long as possible. This results in exhausting the server’s connection table resources.\nByteDos is a Windows desktop DoS application. It is a simple, standalone executable file, which does not require any special installation on the attacker’s PC. ByteDoS is equipped with embedded IP resolver capabilities that allow the attack tool to resolve IPs from domain names. The tool supports two attack vectors: SYN flood and ICMP flood, allowing the user to choose which vector to use during the attack.\nRadware’s ERT will continue to monitor information around the April 7th #OpIsrael attack. Be sure to check back for frequent updates as April 7th draws closer in order to remain informed and prepared. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'DDoS Mitigation\', \'DNS Attacks\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/04/opisrael-attack-set-for-april-7/');

But a closer look actually reveals that they are entwined. In this post I’ll break down the ways in which application delivery and security work hand-in-hand.\n\nTo begin, let’s look at this from a customer viewpoint. The customer’s objective, regardless of the industry, and type of application they’re running, is to ensure that application SLA is constantly met and that the quality of experience (QoE) is satisfactory. Otherwise, they risk declining revenues and customer “churn” – end results that no one wants. As a result, it’s obvious that application delivery capabilities are needed in order to perform traffic reduction and health monitoring as well as maintain consistency and application acceleration. Otherwise, a specific server might get over-loaded and traffic sent to a non-available server, which may cause the entire application to crash. In addition, employing an application delivery solution will allow the customer to successfully handle seasonal traffic spikes.  \nNow, what happens if the application is under attack? Will the traffic redirection still work properly?   Will checking the health of the servers be enough? Will persistently sending the user session to specific servers work? Not necessarily. In fact, failing to properly handle security attacks expeditiously might prove fatal when it comes to maintaining high QoE and SLA. It’s very important to detect application-level or network-level security threats BEFORE applying application delivery techniques. Otherwise, there are a number of odd scenarios that might take place. For example, attack packets may spread evenly throughout all servers, causing each and every server to become overloaded. In addition, today it’s commonplace to see more and more application-level threats and multi-vector attacks that are not fully mitigated by network security solutions. Mitigating these threats requires an application delivery controller (ADC) as well as additional security solutions, such as WAF and the Web Services Firewall/Gateway. \nBecause application delivery and security work hand-in-hand, today’s ADCs offer a set of comprehensive features that help address availability and security challenges, including SYS cookie protection, DoS protection, hardware DoS mitigation engine, behavioral DoS protection and more. \nThere is, however, more to security and application delivery than the ADC itself. Below is a list of best practices for deploying application delivery and security solutions in tandem:\n\nPlace a dedicated DDoS mitigation device before the ADC and core switching – so that high-volume attacks can be stopped before getting to the ADC and from there to the server farms.\n\nUse behavioral DoS mitigation capabilities to generate signatures in real-time – in order to detect anomalies and defend from emerging threats such as low-and-slow attacks.\n\nDeploy a “clean pipe” service in the cloud – that can protect the Internet pipe of the organization from volumetric attacks that threaten to block it. \n\nDeploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) adjacent to the ADC – to protect from Web application level threats and enable compliance. \n\nDeploy Web Services Firewall/Gateway – to protect from XML and Web Service specific threats that cannot be detected and blocked by a standard WAF.  This mainly applies to organizations using service oriented architecture (SOA) concepts. \n\nReview and align your organizational security policies – to ensure the right authorization level for each user type – employee, partner, customers, etc. \n\nAs you can see, while application delivery and security may be two separate entities, a closer look reveals the ways in which they truly work hand-in-hand.  \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'application delivery\', \'data center\', \'security\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/applicationdelivery/2013/03/how-application-delivery-and-security-work-hand-in-hand/');

Drawing from attacks handled by our Emergency Response Team (ERT), Radware recently conducted research on the ways in which pre-attack planning and detailed preparation dramatically increases the potency and success rate of attacks.\n\nRather than naively selecting a target and aimlessly launching an attack, more and more attackers are diligently preparing their strategies by studying potential targets very closely and gathering information about their vulnerabilities. This allows them to deploy the most effective attack vectors against their target(s). In fact, attackers will even conduct \"dry runs\" in order to evaluate the best approach for their selected attack vectors. Once attackers have learned the victim’s site and determined the vectors and strategy, they often use tools to test their findings in order to maximize the attack.\nBelow are just a few examples of attacker reconnaissance you’ll find in the report:\nUpstream Pipe Saturation – Attackers identify weak spots that provide the best opportunity for an attack by looking for resource intensive activities of the target server, such as large image files or large PDF documents. After identifying these types of files on the target server, attackers can launch an HTTP GET Flood attack that saturates the upstream Internet pipe by repeatedly requesting these large files.\nSearch Engine Vulnerability – Attackers may use the pre-attack phase to identify search engine vulnerabilities. In one case, attackers used a search engine backend to conclude that search results were not cached on the target site. They then injected iFrames in another compromised website, which pointed to the target website’s search URL in order to exhaust the target server’s CPU. \nInspecting Network Layers – More advanced attackers perform a deep analysis of their target, including network implementation, web server application and the TCP stack. Putting all this data together, attackers gain an exhaustive grasp of the destination site architecture and its security devices (firewalls, IDS, IPS) in order to determine the best method for bringing the target service down. \nTo learn more about the different tactics being used in the pre-attack phase of successful DDoS/DoS attacks, check out our full research report, which provides in-depth analysis of these and other cases.

Related although different in significant ways, both OpenFlow and SDN drove a significant level of attention in the networking industry as Nicira’s Acquisition and Cisco’s moves served to establish the commercial value of SDN. In 2013, we are witnessing serious momentum in terms of discussions and start-ups around SDN. However, the questions remain as to which solutions will be successful and which solutions will become available in the market place first?\n\nIn the IT industry in general, and more specifically in the networking industry, experience tells us that revolutions do not happen. Instead, change takes the form of evolution, and capabilities are introduced gradually through an exercise of cautious risk management. That said, SDN and OpenFlow related products have to find a way to coexist with existing network infrastructures in order to gain significant market traction. There is obviously the case of isolated experimental networks, but this is not market traction. \nThe reluctance to revolutionize networks aligns well with the adoption of overlay network technology (i.e. Nicira), which sees no significant barriers. However, there are only going to be a certain amount of overlay network technologies that will end up being purchased by end customers and competing in this market. Certainly the SDN market is much larger than that.\nSo what technologies are we going to be seeing throughout 2013? First, these technologies will be able to solve current customer problems. Second, these technologies will be able to integrate into existing customer networks. But what are the problems that can be solved best by adding network programmability on top? \nFrom the Radware vantage point, we can strongly state that customer networks need to be better secured. One of the biggest barriers in implementing proper security, especially with the dynamic network traffic nature introduced by server virtualization and mega datacenters, is network integration and placement. Networks are becoming huge fabrics of stateless connectivity, and maintaining state consistently, at the scale required by these networks, is not trivial and is almost impossible. The network security services must be able to act in separation from the existing physical network constraints and be able to sample and configure the entire network. \nFor an edge security device, all network edge points must be representing a unified threat and risk view, and be able to logically behave as a single network edge. This way network security can be more effective in configuring the network to forward traffic to the right security device or to discard traffic if needed. SDN can potentially turn a distributed network with a large amount of signaling into a streamlined, unified, distributed forwarding edge that can make uniform decisions throughout the network. In addition, security services can be scaled and managed to effectively mitigate risk and improve uptime and visibility. \nMost likely, solutions encompassing a set of technologies that can autonomously be implemented in existing networks will be the first to sell. \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ADC\', \'ADC fabric\', \'Nicira\', \"Nicira\'s acquisition\", \'openflow\', \'SDN\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/03/sdn-and-openflow-in-2013/');

It is too easy to hit a stock exchange with a DDoS attack \nTo demonstrate this point, I shared two examples of cyber attacks that contained multiple attack vectors. The first was on a stock exchange that had to suspend trades due to the attack, while the second was against three stock exchanges in the Middle East.\nAlthough stock exchanges are better protected now than they were in the past, paradoxically, they are still vulnerable to cyber attacks. Today, an attacker can utilize five different DDoS attack vectors. All they need is one to be successful. Here is an example of a \"classic\" blend of attack vectors:\n\nUDP Flood\nHTTP Flood\nSYN Flood\nLow-and-Slow (Slowloris, R.U.D.Y, etc)\nDNS Flood\n\n2. Morphology of Cyber Attacks\nIt is very important to understand the characteristics of contemporary DDoS attack campaigns. These are prolonged attacks that average between three days and one week, and in some cases, can last up to several weeks. Today’s DDoS attacks deploy multiple attack vectors, with the anticipation that at least one of those vectors will successfully breach the target’s defenses. Adding to their complexity, attacks often change tactics during this time period to ensure that even if your organization has fully mitigated the current attack, you’ll still have others to contend with.\nIn order to be successful in the face of a prolonged attack campaign you’ll need to have the right tools in your toolbox. Unfortunately, DDoS attacks require a complex solution with multiple components that some organizations are still missing.\n3. Transition from a two-phase security approach to a three-phase security approach\nSome organizations are still operating under a two-phase, \"pre\" and \"post\" attack approach. Simply put, prior to an attack, they are well prepared, having acquired mitigation solutions under the assumption that the attack duration will be as short as they have typically been in the past. After the attack, these organizations then draw conclusions from the event in order to improve accordingly.\nTo mitigate today’s threats, organizations must be prepared for prolonged DDoS attack campaigns. With a prolonged attack campaign, however, you have to react DURING the attack. Unfortunately, many organizations simply do not have the capacity to do so.\nAs a result, it is critical for organizations to enlist the services of a dedicated \"response team\" that has experience mitigating prolonged DDoS attacks in order to match the capabilities of the attackers. If skilled hackers are attacking your organization around the clock for days or weeks, you’ll need similar capacity in order to counter the attack. Furthermore, if the attackers are conducting reconnaissance on your site, you’ll need your team to gather intelligence in order to learn more about the attackers and their motivation as well as deploy countermeasure techniques in order to cripple an attack. \nSummary\nAlthough the theme for my presentation at RSA this year focused on stock exchanges, it’s clear that the subject matter is applicable to other sectors as well. For instance, the lessons learned from cyber attacks on stock exchanges are critical for understanding the recent spate of DDoS attacks on US banks.\n Once an organization understands the need to prepare themselves for prolonged attacks, and recognizes the value of a dedicated and experienced response team to back them up, we should expect to see an increase of elite \"task forces\" that will respond with tenacity and fervor similar to the attackers.\nTo learn more, check out my RSA presentation here or share your comments below – Have you experienced an increase in attack length or number of attack vectors used against your organization? \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AMS\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Attacks\', \'DDoS attack\', \'DoS\', \'ERT\', \'flood attacks\', \'hacktivism\', \'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/03/stock-exchanges-in-line-of-fire/');

Why are they calling you? The attack is coming from your servers.\n\nDuring the recent wave of cyber attacks on US financial institutions, dubbed, “Operation Ababil” by the perpetrators, the above scenario was no hypothetical. It was happening in real time. In fact, during the second wave of bank attacks, a large hosting company that received complaints that several of its web servers in its facility were participating in an attack contacted Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) for assistance.\nFrom Operation Ababil’s inception, the ERT has closely followed the attack campaign’s evolution. For the most part, our efforts were mainly concentrated on assisting targeted banks, and indeed, as we reported in the past, some of our customer’s environments had seen massive multi-vector attacks, amounting up to 65 Gbps.\nBut our examination doesn’t end with an assessment of attack vectors or traffic. While analyzing these attacks, we noticed that most of the attack volume was originating from just few dozen hosts. These were web servers, compromised and controlled by hackers, herded to assemble powerful botnets. This was the case of the hosting company that called upon the ERT a few weeks back – their servers were generating attack traffic towards one of the banks. Indeed, hosting companies’ servers are sometimes the forgotten victims of these attacks, consuming large percentage of the server farm’s outbound bandwidth and computing power.\nThe Strengths of ‘Server Botnets’\nIt’s no secret that acquiring a large, home-PC based botnet is an easy task these days. These are available for rent starting from just a few hundred dollars. But generating DDoS attacks using a PC Botnet has major drawbacks in bandwidth and availability. This is precisely where a botnet composed of servers has its strengths:\n\nBandwidth – While the average US home computer has 600 Kbps upload speed, hosted servers can reach up to 100 Mbps. This means that a couple of attacking servers will generate the same amount of attack traffic as dozens of home PCs. \nAvailability – While home users tend to shutdown their computers, hosting companies must be available 24×7, enabling hackers to launch an attack using servers that are available all the time.  \n\nInfection Process\nIn order to create a server botnet and benefit from its advantages the hacker needs to hack and infect the servers. While it is possible to hack vast amounts of home computers using Spam, drive-by download or any other Bittorrent/P2P file download, taking over servers requires exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities and therefore higher technical skills. Hosting companies apply various security appliances such as Firewalls and IPS in their data centers, and the bandwidth and computing resources of servers are traced for billing purposes.\nHowever, despite these security measures hackers often mange to overcome these challenges. In the latest attacks they utilized PHP based vulnerabilities in order to inject their malicious codes into the target server. This code was then used to upload and execute DDoS attacking scripts on the compromised server.\nERT Best Practice\nHosting companies should ensure their servers are complying with basic security guidelines. Having endpoint protection is your first line of defense. But this approach will fail if attackers use obfuscation techniques. The ERT recommends that network administrators at hosting farms closely monitor outbound traffic and look for the following abnormal activities:\n\nSudden, long lasting increase of outbound traffic. Hosting environments see daily increases in outbound bandwidth, but these are gradual and follow times of high demand.\nHigh number of outbound TCP connections, especially on ports 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS respectively). This is abnormal for hosting environments that usually see the vast majority of connection requests inbound. In addition, a high velocity of UDP traffic in non-characteristic outbound ports, mainly 80. \n\nOnce an anomaly has been detected, try to identify it by taking a capture file for example, and analyze its nature. \nFor a deeper dive into server-based botnets and other new attack tools, check out the ERT’s Annual Global Application and Network Security Report.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'banks\', \'Botnets\', \'DDoS attack\', \'ERT\', \'hosting\', \'server\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/02/rise-of-server-botnets/');

Server-based botnets give attackers a much bigger bang for the buck.  A DDoS attack using servers instead of client-based bots is like hitting someone with a 50 pound bag at once instead of pelting someone with hundreds of bean bags.  Regarding sophistication, using Radware’s APT score, the number of attacks scoring 7 or higher (out of 10) increased 150% (58% in 2012 compared to 23% in 2011).\n\nProtecting the organization’s environment against the rising tide of sophisticated threats requires strong security.  This comes in the form of products, proper device configuration, policy, and vigilance to discover problems or breaches.  When products are deployed and initially configured they are at their optimum state:  ready to thwart whatever is thrown at them.  Eventually system configurations (settings) will begin to \"drift\" away from the optimum state.  The changes are slight – an update to an application opens a new port or changing the permissions associated with a user group can grant access where it shouldn’t be allowed.  Over time these small modifications build on themselves and eventually the device has drifted significantly, thus rendering it less effective.  Given that drift is gradual it is generally not noticed that the security infrastructure has drifted away from the desired good state.  It is also very difficult to get it back on track.\nSecurity drift is a problem because it can directly impact the three pillars of security – Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.  IT has become seduced by a whirlwind of technology enhancements. All of these new technologies need to be secured but the focus in protection has generally been towards the confidentiality pillar – keeping my \"stuff\" out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have it.  What is normally pushed into the background are the other pillars: the integrity of the systems (and data) and the availability of the systems.\nIntegrity is maintained with a change auditing process. First a baseline of a desired state is established for any object.  After the desired state is established, comparisons can be made between the current state and the baseline state. Any deviations are flagged and alerts are sent to appropriate parties for corrective action.  Integrity drift can be identified quickly and systems returned to a “desired state”.\nAvailability issues are a growing concern for organizations.  It isn’t that networking technology can’t keep up with the huge growth in network connected devices, web services, and traffic volume.  It is that attackers (many of them activists) have decided that they can damage a company or organization by impacting availability.  Denial of Service attacks are growing in number and duration.  In a story entitled \"Denial-of-service attacks are surging all across the Internet\", USA TODAY reported that denial of service attacks increased 70% in the first half of 2012 when compared to 2011.  Additionally Radware’s Industry Security Survey in 2012 reports that 2 out of 3 organizations experience at least one DoS attack a year and almost a quarter are attacked at least every month.  To maintain availability organizations must have a process, just as they need for confidentiality and integrity.  They must understand what resources are necessary to mitigate DoS and DDoS attacks in their specific environments.  One consideration is the network architecture.  To be most effective the mitigation resources need to be the first element (or as close to it as possible) in the network path. The organization must account for the criticality of specific resources and maintain a process to prioritize resources.  They must also ensure they have the critical tools (and services) necessary to maintain their availability.   One of these critical tools is in the form of people.  Organizations should have a quick response team that can dynamically respond and employ tactics to mitigate the existing attack and any immediate follow-on attack.\nUltimately when the \"old school\" concepts of security – confidentiality, integrity, and availability – are taken into equal consideration it allows IT to protect their assets, maintain the desired security state, and ensure access.  By emphasizing the avoidance of security drift and formalizing a process to accomplish it, innovation is easier because improvements will be done with confidence that security can be maintained.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitgation\', \'DDoS attack\', \'ERT report\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/02/security-posture-drift-thinking-old-school/');

It was prepared by our security experts – the Emergency Response Team (ERT) – whoâve seen their fair share of cyber attacks while actively monitoring and mitigating attacks in real-time. In this yearâs annual report, our experts have uncovered several new trends in cyber-security worthy of a closer look.\n\nDoS/DDoS attacks that utilize server-based botnets and encrypted layer HTTPS attacks are just two of the more significant attack types in hackersâ updated arsenals. Which, as of late, have plagued many of the largest U.S. financial institutions. Â In addition, ERT research has evidenced a significant uptick in the number of complex attacks. These advanced persistent threats (APTs) are characterized by an increase in the length of attack incident (sometimes lasting days or up to a month), have multiple attack vectors (as many as 10 on the high end) and are highly effective as organizations have not developed the means to sustain this type of an attack campaign. They are very good at preparation before, also in forensics after the attack, but do not operate effectively under a prolonged attack. This is equivalent to âbringing a knife to a gunfightâ â organizations arenât sufficiently armed for todayâs fight.\nHowever, there is a silver lining in this black cloud. These long attack campaigns provide organizations the time to fight back. During these prolonged attacks, security experts have the ability to collect intelligence about the attacker such as who they are and tools used â all in âreal-timeâ which can give an organization the chance to deploy counter measure techniques to stop the attackers.\nThe 44-page report can also act as a valuable resource for any cyber security expert who wants to gain up-to-date knowledge and actionable intelligence on how to better detect and quell these types of attacks. It also provides quick tools, such as Radwareâs âAdvanced Persistent Threat (APT) scoreâ, which can help organizations quantify attacks based on their level of sophistication and persistence. Youâll find the numbers to be staggering â with 58% of attacks in 2012 having scored a 7 or higher in complexity (out of 10).\nOur ERT also shares their recommendations to help you combat against emerging attack trends and techniques such as the amount of security engineers you would need to fight a typical persistent DDoS attack,Â  and why you would need externalÂ  âforce multiplierâ teams instead. Or the need to have a âmitigation checklistâ completed with any missing elements to be addressed.\nOur 2012 Global Application and Network Security report can be accessed here. Feel free to download the report and use it as a future reference guide as we donât see these new types of attacks slowing down any time soon.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application security\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'DDoS Guide\', \'DoS\', \'ERT\', \'Global Application and N', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/01/new-attack-trends-are-you-bringing-a-knife-to-the-gunfight/');

While the questions of forensics and culpability pose a particular challenge when it comes to cyber security, there are a number of unprecedented components to these attacks that should absolutely command our attention.\n\nComing up on close to four months, there is no doubt that the US bank attacks represent the longest persistent cyber attack on a single industrial sector in history. However, the question remains as to how these attacks have managed to be as successful as they have been.\nThe answer lies in the innovative tactics the attackers have deployed:\n\n\nLeveraging data centers and cloud-hosting providers â To be sure, these are not your garden variety DDoS attacks. By exploiting the remote servers and cloud infrastructure that financial institutions rely on, hackers have been able to amplify the attack using a toolkit dubbed âitsoknoproblembro.â Taking over proxy servers, the attacks have consumed bandwidth, processing power and data storage in unprecedented amounts – amounts that these institutions simply canât handle.\n\n\nUsage of server-based botnets â Another distinguishing feature of these attacks is the usage of server-based botnets in place of lone server attacks. The use of multiple infected servers organized in a single botnet has allowed for a significant increase in firepower and reliability as well as more sophisticated command and control.\n\n\nThe rise of encrypted layer attacks â In addition to infected data centers and server-based botnets, the perpetrators have launched attacks via the encrypted layers used by these institutions to conduct secure financial transactions. The use of encrypted layers has allowed many of these attacks to escape early detection and fly below the radar, making them much more difficult to combat.\n\n\nWhile debates about who is to blame for the attacks will continue to raise more questions than answers, there can be no doubt that the introduction of these new tactics are evidence of an evolving cyber security landscape. One in which the attacks are more sophisticated and more severe, and one which requires a new approach from security professionals moving forward.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AMS\', \'attack mitigation\', \'DDoS attack\', \'DDoS Attacks\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/01/us-bank-attacks-in-review-its-a-brave-new-world/');

These folks are normally tasked with some routine activities throughout the year with their affiliated military âunit,â which is generally fulfilled during a weekend or two as not to disrupt their âdayâ jobs.\nHowever, have you noticed how similar a private cyber warrior is to a military cyber warrior? In suggesting this, Iâm not trying to take anything away from my military brethren. But the duties, tasks and efforts are eerily similar. The nature and persistency of modern day cyber-attacks has forged a new type of information security professional – someone who needs to sacrifice nights, weekends, sleep and a personal life to answer the call of cyber defense duty. Sounds a lot like what I knew when I was in the military.\nFirst, letâs put things into perspective. As 2012 came to a close it became clear that this past year would no doubt go down as epic in the memory books of information security professionals. If 2011 had a fanatical pace, 2012 was simply frenetic.Â  Also, if the relative efficacy of these attacks is any guide, then hold onto your hats for 2013, which has the potential to make 2012 look like childâs play.\nIf you look back on 2012, you can find a plethora of security programs that have been overrun by nefarious perpetrators and notice a sea change in what the risk landscape looks like compared to 2011. Below is a broad stroke of some of the most notable attacks that reflect ânight and weekend defenses:â\n\nJan Â – Feb: Anonymous attacks on various Israeli websites\nMarch: Operation Global Blackout âAnonymous threatens to take out the internet by attacking the DNS infrastructure of the world\nJuly â Aug: Admin.HLP Trojan threat advisory issued by Radwareâs Emergency Response team in reaction to evidence that it wreaks havoc in wild\nAugust:Â AT&T suffers a near day long outage originating from an attack on their DNS infrastructure\nSept â Oct:Â Operation Ababil launched against US banking interests. The vast majority of US banks suffer various degrees of outages including most of the top institutions. New SSL attack tool leveraged throughout this attack.\nNov â Dec:Â OpIsrael & OpZion launched against various Israeli interests as a results of ongoing political struggles\n\nThe list above reflects only a small portion of attack profiles for the year. But as they say, hindsight is 20/20. These attacks can act as âlessons learnedâ to educate us on how to handle future attacks for years to come.\nAll in all, what did we learn from these attacks in 2012? Itâs safe to say that weâd be fooling ourselves if we believed that the overall successes were isolated to a few obscure examples or the result of luck. In my opinion, these attacks were by-and-large effective across a multitude of technologies, geographies and industries without regard to the size of the company, their security technologies, geographic operations, or amount of people studying the problem (e.g. security professionals and risk assessment results).\nHowever, one of the most amazing lessons learned was that these attacks have grown in both persistency and scale as illustrated in the graphic below.\nWhat the slide above reveals is that in a very short period of time (e.g. 18 months) we have seen the average duration of a cyber-attack increase from 3 days to 20 days. This number continues to climb as we closed out 2012 – both OpAbabil and OpIsrael lasted for over three weeks. We can also see that the number of security attack vectors rose from 4 to 7. A number that is likely to double again in 2013. These are staggering figures and require the resources of an internal security program staffed for 24/7 defensive operations with the ability to remain in constant fighting mode for more than three weeks.\nBut ask yourself this – is your information security program staffed for attrition and knowledge? For round-the-clock operations in defending against a cyber attack? On weekends?\nIf the answer is ânoâ – then you simply arenât prepared for the coming fight.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacking\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/01/new-weekend-warriors-it-pros/');

Unfortunately, many organizations that find themselves under attack don’t know how to change the attack dynamics. Instead of working to halt attacks, many just wait passively for them to conclude.\nBut what about stopping the attack? Why can’t organizations become more proactive and implement counter measures that can halt the attackers from sending additional malicious traffic? Why not push the hackers back as far as possible from critical applications?\nAccording to Cyber Security on the Offense, a recent study by Radware and the Ponemon Institute, 71 percent of respondents gave their organizations an average or below average rating when it comes to their ability to launch or implement counter techniques against hackers and other cyber criminals. The main reasons for not being effective in launching counter measures include the lack of enabling technologies, resources, budget and the dearth of expert personnel. (To read the full report – click here.)\nThis is a worrisome picture. Despite the fact that many organizations find themselves affected by attack campaigns that last for many days, they lack the capabilities to stop or to reduce the effectiveness of these attacks.\nIn 2013, it’s time to get proactive! Here are some recommendations for organizations that would like to halt attacks rather than merely absorb them:\n\nEstablish an emergency response team that can detect and respond to attack campaigns 24×7 for as many days as required. Train this team to investigate who the attackers are and what their motivation is.\nGain knowledge on the attack tools, techniques and modes of operation used by hackers in previous campaigns.\nWhen under attack, quickly detect and understand which attack tools are being used in order to anticipate what you should expect.\nImplement techniques to perform counter measures. Each attack tool that hackers use has weaknesses that can be exploited in a counter measure to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the tool.\nDevelop an attackers’ black list and work with your CDN provider or your ISP to black list the attackers before they reach your network. This will allow you to push the attackers as far as possible from your critical applications.\n\nOrganizations that implemented these recommendations in 2012 managed to shorten the length of the cyber attacks they faced and reduced the damage they experienced. Next time your organization is under attack, make the choice to be proactive in order to minimize the attack’s effectiveness rather than just waiting passively for its termination.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacking\', \'Hacktivist\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2013/01/mitigating-attacks-in-2013/');

In October, it was US banks and financial institutions that faced a barrage of cyber attacks during “Operation Ababil.” In November, Israeli websites came under fire during the Anonymous led “OpIsrael” attacks. However, there is a stark contrast in the effectiveness of these two attack operations. While the banking attacks were by-and-large successful, the attacks on Israeli websites fell short.\nOf course the question for security experts is – how do we explain this disparity? Is it because the financial sector didn’t have enough resources or serious professionals dedicated to program management? Is it because the Israeli government possessed a cyber defense strategy that was executed flawlessly? In truth, neither scenario seems likely and the real answer may make some a bit uncomfortable.\nThe reality is that attack mitigation is not a core competency of modern day security programs. The problem is that it’s those of us who expect they will experience a cyber attack that end up in better shape than those who don’t. Yes, when it comes to cyber security, paranoia is a virtue!\nTake the following example: have you as a security professional ever tested your environment for a cyber attack? Do you know how to mitigate them? (No, these aren’t modern day “Pen Tests” which don’t test ‘service disrupting techniques’) I would argue that during OpAbabil the US banks were more concerned with compliance and data leakage (both very important attributes of a security program) than with the notion of defending against a cyber attack. But they should have been.\nNow, let’s shift gears from whether or not a security program should be prepared for an attack to the question of vulnerabilities. Suppose we ask, “how do you mitigate vulnerabilities?” Well, that question is easier to answer and probably makes people more comfortable. But today’s risks are not about individual threats or single vulnerabilities. They are a cacophony of trialed threat and exploit vectors — something we term as an “attack.” Given the fact that cyber security world has changed over the past two years to an attack based model that has its own new attributes the important question to ask is – have you changed to adapt your control infrastructure to these new techniques?\nIn light of these changes, here’s the call to action: it’s high time we, as security professionals, begin the process of not only dealing with individual vulnerabilities but also diving deep into popular attack types, schemes, and tools (e.g. platforms) in order to prepare ourselves with better and more competent responses. These attacks are unique and represent a new under-studied are for information security programs. The graphic below helps explain this concept on a deeper level. To be sure, attacks do have a relationship with vulnerabilities, but it is clear we are now dealing with a different animal altogether!\n \n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacking\', \'Hacktivist\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/12/op-ababil-vs-opisrael/');

Most will employ different layers of defense for an encrypted attack. However, this approach will not be effective if an attack included an availability-based threat vector such as Denial of Service attack or zero-day advanced threats.\nThis is because processing an encrypted attack consumes more system resources than processing non-encrypted data. As a result, an attacker is able to make a big impact even at relatively low rates of requests per second. The solutions that can decrypt the traffic can only detect the known low rate attacks rather than the unknowns (zero-day).\nTo really help mitigate an attack such as this, a network needs to include another layer which is the network wide attack protection.\nI share my thoughts on what an organization needs in order to successfully handle these threats and invite you to read this column to learn more about it.

Over the past few months, we’ve seen strong evidence that cyber attacks, including DDoS and DoS attacks, will only continue to become more intense and more powerful. With little chance these attacks will slow down in the new year, it is essential for organizations to act now to protect themselves. That’s why we commissioned a new in-depth research report, “Cyber Security on the Offense: A study of IT Security Experts.” Co-authored with the Ponemon Institute, this survey of 705 senior IT security practitioners explores the current cyber threat landscape and how well prepared organizations are to deal with today’s large-scale DDoS and DoS attacks.\nThe results are telling. The majority of organizations (64 percent) say that the severity of cyber attacks is increasing, however less than half of organizations say they are vigilant in monitoring attacks. 65 percent of respondents had also experienced an average of three DDoS attacks over the past 12 months, with several respondents noting they had experienced more than 10 attacks. In essence, cyber attacks are simply outpacing many organizations’ ability to respond.\nWe’re also seeing a major shift in the way companies are approaching cyber attacks. While just two years ago organizations were very much focused on confidentiality and integrity based attacks, survey respondents indicated that their top priority is now mitigating availability based attacks. As cyber attackers and hacktivists now focus on taking critical applications and networks down for long periods of time, organizations have been forced to switch priorities to better protect their perimeters.\nThere’s a wealth of key findings in our full report, which you can download here, but I’ve compiled a list of four key takeaways your organization should act on after reading the report:\n\nTake an offensive stance: Organizations need to be both proactive and offensive in the fight against cyber attacks. Survey results showed that an offensive stance that includes both prevention and counter measures can help protect organizations from both attacks and related consequences.\nEducate yourself: The survey showed us that many organizations often have no real sense of how often they’ve been attacked and are not vigilant in monitoring. I can’t stress this enough: it is essential to be aware of today’s security threats and the available options to prevent such attacks. “We didn’t know” is no longer an acceptable (or business savvy) response. Our new site, DDosWarriors, is also a good resource for the latest on DDoS attacks and security threats.\nUnderstand the consequences: The survey shows the quantifiable consequences of cyber attacks, both in terms of lost revenue and reputation damage. For some of the IT managers surveyed, this was more than $100,000 in lost revenue for every minute of down time, and an average of $22,000 per minute across all surveyed organizations.\nThe time to act is now: Given that cyber attacks are growing in size, number and intensity every day, it is more important than ever for organizations to take proper precautions and make an effort to protect themselves without delay. The findings from the research should be a call to action for the industry, and I urge organizations to take necessary steps to protect themselves now.\n\n\n\nTo take a deeper dive into the report, sign up here for our webinar with Larry Ponemon from the Ponemon Institute on November 14, where we’ll discuss the survey findings and provide additional actionable insights to help organizations mitigate attacks in an increasingly hostile threat environment.\n \n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacking\', \'hacktivism\', \'Hacktivist\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/11/it-security-tipping-point/');

However, in light of the recent damage wrought by Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey election officials are allowing voters displaced by the storm to cast their ballots via email as well.\nBut the question remains â how secure is email voting? Past experience with hackers suggests that they choose the timing of their attacks strategically in order to maximize the amount of disruption they cause. An attack on Election Day would certainly do just that. A denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on email servers could potentially delay ballots and disenfranchise voters. Although the number of online voters is not significant relative to the population at large, any disruption to the normal voting process is likely to raise questions of legitimacy.\nRecent history demonstrates that the electoral process is not immune to the increasingly hostile global cyber security environment.

This past March, Canadian elections were interrupted with a DDoS attack that forced the voting period to be prolonged.\nOf course, one might ask whether hackers and hacktivist groups actually have the ability to carry out such attacks.

Till now, the majority of organizations have focused primarily on the best ways to use social media to advance their business goals while guarding against employee misconduct. But with the substantial increase in the amount of sensitive data flowing across social media platforms, organizations should be asking whether or not social media makes their network environments more susceptible to both internal and external cyber threats. In this post I explore some of the key ways in which social media is changing the cyber security landscape and offer best practices for organizations looking to increase their “social security.”\nWhether we’re talking about Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin or YouTube, hackers are exploiting social media in the following ways:\n1. Increased vulnerability – From the increased availability of sensitive information to the potential for data leakage, social media sites have the capacity to make organizations more vulnerable than ever before. Man-in-the-browser attacks are quickly becoming a popular way of infecting computers from social media websites.\n2. Social media as a weapon – Hackers are deploying new forms of malware that weaponize social media, converting sites into command and control servers to infect systems and carry out attacks.\n3. Organization and messaging – Social media has provided a space for hackers to organize across borders and communicate not only with each other but also with the public at large. With the uptick in ideologically based attacks over the past year, social media has become the primary instrument of communication for cyber criminals worldwide.\nIn the wake of these threats, what’s an organization to do?\nTo start, companies and institutions need to acknowledge that social media is here to stay. Even companies that have gone so far as to ban social media usage at work through the use of filters and proxies cannot control what employees do on their own devices they might bring to the office. The increasing trend of BYOD is making it harder and harder for organizations to protect their network through filters alone. Instead of the zero-sum approach, organizations should have a company policy in place regarding social media usage and take the time to educate their employees on the risks (and rewards!) of social media.\nCorporate policies and best practices, however, can only go so far. Organizations need to take seriously the increasing threats that may emerge via social media and ensure that measures are in place to defend against cyber attacks that hit their networks, such as zero-day attacks and potential network behavior anomalies. In addition, reputation based services will help prevent Man-in-the-browser attacks from causing network administrators ongoing headaches.\nWhile there is no doubt that social media will continue to impact cyber security in ever-sophisticated ways, a serious level of preparedness is the first step for organizations looking to shore up their network security in the midst of an increasingly insecure environment.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacking\', \'Hacktivist\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/10/the-new-social-security-cyber-security/');
INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (436, 'From Defense to Offense â Three Steps to Successful Attack Mitigation', 'Ronen Kenig', '2012-10-19', 'In the same week that undercover FBI agents foiled a plot to attack the Federal Reserve Bank in New York City, a ninth bank was hit in what has been an ongoing cyber-assault on financial institutions in the United States. While these two different types of attacks, one physical and one electronic, share similar targets, both were met with two very distinct mitigation strategies.\nIn the case of the Federal Reserve, undercover federal agents took a proactive posture. The public was never in danger because agents led the attacker to believe he was given real bomb making materials. However, in the case of the bank cyber attacks, despite prior knowledge of being targeted for DDoS attacks, banks have been on the defensive, scrambling to stop the hemorrhage disrupting their operations. The lesson here is clear â a strong offense is the best defense against hackers.\nWith the cyber attacks showing no signs of slowing down and continuing to cause a major disruption in the way we do banking, here are the three most important steps that financial institutions can take to best protect themselves:\n1. As the old adage goes, sometimes the best defense is a good offense\nHackers armed with nothing more than a computer keyboard and code, disrupted the operations of almost a dozen banks and continue to threaten the financial services industry. Attacks against these nine banks will not only bear a significant cost to each individual institution, but may force customers to question their bankâs ability to secure personal information. To quantify the value of a strong offense, just try placing a value on losing customer trust. In this scenario, being on the offensive rather than taking a purely defensive posture is the new black. Stronger counter-measure operations that include shutting down the attacking computers, changing their course of action and eventually reducing the motivation of volunteers to join these attacks is essential. This will give banks the ability to change the attackâs dynamics and move from defense to offense.\n2. More sophisticated attacks necessitate the need for more sophisticated defenses\nTodayâs hackers are much more sophisticated than ever before, using high-capacity, high-throughput servers compromised in advance to launch massive and intense attacks. Attacks like âGozi Prinimalkaâ or âitsoknoproblembroâ require advanced mitigation tools that can effectively deal with multi-layered threats that simultaneously strike the network, application and server. More and more, security teams are noticing that these attacks are persistent, lasting for days and sometimes even weeks. For banks to protect themselves from these attacks, they need to ensure they have advanced enterprise-wide security event management, service denial and behavioral protections as well as network scanning and malware propagation protections.\nUnfortunately, most organizations arenât staffed to fight a battle of attrition. Without real-time protection against these volumetric attacks itâs just a matter of time until more systems are compromised.\n3. Put in place best practices for Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)\nThe best approach for organizations to deal with the new era in cyber attacks â Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) or attacks that are ongoing – is to have an emergency response plan. They should arm themselves with tools, techniques and staff members critical to responding to todayâs APT cyber attacks. This includes and is not limited to:\n\nHaving a âwar roomâ: Identify internal IT staff, as well as external support through your IT vendor, MSSP or security systems vendor, to respond to attacks before they take place.\nA customer support plan: Provide an alternate way for customers to reach the bank, such as a dedicated call center, in order to maintain an open line of communication. Reassure your customers by informing them that the attack isÂ  âavailability-basedâ and does not compromise their private information.\nBuilding a stronger offense: This will ultimately strengthen your defensive plan and help you build out a strong plan for counter-attacks.\n\nWhile the threat of DDoS attacks on high profile institutions is omnipresent, being under persistent threat does not mean that banks have to be vulnerable. While having a solid plan wonât stop attacks from coming, it will definitely limit the impact attacks have on your enterprise, and most importantly, your customerâs perception of how safe their money is.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Attacks\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'malware\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/10/from-defense-to-offense-three-steps-to-successful-attack-mitigation/');

Morgan Chase. That entire attack campaign lasted for five days in which all the proclaimed targets have been attacked.\nERTÂ OBSERVATIONS:\nThese recent attacks were investigated and analyzed by Radware’sÂ ERTÂ (Emergency Response Team) and reached the following conclusions:\n\nThe same attackers were behind at least two of the attacks. We can conclude this based on the attack traffic and the pattern of the attacks.\nThe actual attack traffic didnât contain the attack tool that was published for use.Â  In its postings, Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al Qassam published several attack tools including the Mobile LOIC Apache Killer version.Â  That tool was not present in the observed attack traffic, however, meaning it is possible that the Cyber fighters of Izz ad-din Al Qassam group was NOT behind the attack after all, or that it didnât manage to recruit supporters to its attack who were willing to use the Mobile LOIC attack tool.\nDuring the attacks the attackers managed to generate very high throughput of Denial of Service (DoS) attack traffic. We believe that in order to generate such a massive amount of traffic, the attackers utilized many computers and probably a large botnet.\nTo make a political statement and garner media attention, hacktivists target top financial institutions, such as attacks on the Bank of Israel earlier this year. It seems that beyond government agencies, high profile financial institutions are at higher risk to be attacked during a cyber war.\n\nTAKE AWAYS\nAttacks are falling more and more into the advanced persistent threat (APT) category and target specific entities or industries. (At least one of these attacks lasted almost five days.) Organizations today are not capable of handling such a long period of attacks, and should rethink their best practices to handle these persistent attacks and build a security team that can resist such protracted events.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'APT\', \'DDoS attack\', \'ERT\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/09/radwares-ert-analyzes-operation-ababil/');

By doing this, business are able to take advantage of emerging technologies and expert level service, while keeping costs low, lowering risk and removing complexity from their IT network.\nWith that growing demand comes technology maturity and the proliferation of technologies for a cloud-in-a-box solution, which has lowered the basic barrier of entry to the market. While most providers offer basic servicesÂ  —Â  like networking, local storage capacity and processing power provided by physical or virtual machinesÂ  — Â there are a number of other capabilities that are needed for enterprise data centers. Letâs take a look at a few of them below, so you know what customers are looking for when searching for their next hosting provider.\nValue Added Services for Hosted Customers\n\nLoad Balancing and SSL Termination â This service allows customers to scale their application across multiple hosted servers and virtual machines, while offering full transaction privacy. This is a must have for mid-sized enterprises moving to the cloud. If you already provide this service consider the added value of also providing single, customer dedicated load balancing with an SLA guarantee.\n\n\nWeb Application Response Time Optimization â New technologies of Web Performance Optimization save development expenses and accelerate the page view time considerably. Hosting providers who offer a Web optimization service are the first choice for any online business that moves to the cloud. This service allows hosting sites to enjoy part of the budget that has historically gone exclusively to content delivery network providers.\n\n\nApplication Performance Measurements â One thing that is stopping customers from hosting their applications is the loss of application performance monitoring. While hosting providers donât want to commit to a performance SLA, many offer real-time collection of the user experience, providing customers the full visibility and confidence in their service, plus performance and measurement services that customers can use for capacity planning and trouble shooting.\n\n\nDDoS Protection â Cyber attacks have become a major threat to organizations. Many enterprises use DDoS services from their ISP or other DDoS providers when they serve their applications from their local data center, mostly because they donât have the level of expertise in-house that is required to prevent attacks. When moving to a hosting service, customers prefer getting the services from the hosting provider. DDoS mitigation tools are available today for easy integration to the hosting provider perimeter where they can effectively protect the hosting infrastructure and customers application\n\n\nWeb Application Protection and Compliance â End-user facing applications, especially those that involve secure transactions, require an extra layer of protection and compliance to regulations. Customers are very happy to hand off the responsibility of protecting their applications and guaranteeing compliance to the experts. That value-added service can be provided by using Web application firewalls. Also, enterprise applications are often similar to each other, using off-the-shelf CMS from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and others. For that reason, hosting providers find it easy to repeatedly sell the same protection services to a large number of customers.\n\nAs the hosting competition increases, itâs important to include all of these extra services to generate increased revenue and secure customers that are searching for feature-rich single source providers. Plus, you will find that increasingly large budgets are being spent on these services elsewhere that could easily be provided by the hosting company itself.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application delivery\', \'ddos\', \'Optimization\', \'Performance\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/09/hosting-providers-to-boost-revenue/');

The time or sizes of potential attacks are unknown. Additionally, we’ve identified two companies’ URLs that were found on HOIC booster scripts in the last 24 hrs. Presumably, this means that two companies could be targeted for future attacks. Others may be targeted as well.\nAttack Information\nHOIC (High Orbit Ion Cannon) is an HTTP Flood attack tool, created by Anonymous, available as an easy-to-run Windows executable generating DDoS attacks. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it offers customized booster scripts targeting victims’ website pages and subpages, therefore increasing the attacks’ intensity and lowering the odds that  attacks will be stopped.\nHOIC is a relatively new tool which Group Anonymous leverages as a ‘weapon system’ of sorts. This tool allows Anonymous to change the ‘ordinance’ of the attack via a concept called “Boosters.” These Boosters are software scripts which can be uploaded into the HOIC tool to vary to the attack type and effectiveness.\nRadware ERT Advice\nMake sure your DoS and DDoS protection equipment is properly configured to block the HOIC attack tool and to protect your critical online services from a multi-vector attack on your network and applications.\nRadware’s customers are encouraged to contact our support team and to receive immediate assistance from our ERT team.

As most of the secure platform myths have been busted, we have definitely crossed into new territory this year.\nFirst of all, malware is now very much a mainstream business practice. Years ago, security researchers found exploits and disclosed them to companies for the purpose of fixing the hole. Today, some researchers may still use the same code of ethics, however, there’s profit to be had in return for finding flaws in systems. The buyers of these exploits could be businesses wishing to target each other in competitive infection or spying. Also, being that new cold war strategies of governments include hacking other countries and their resident companies, there is vast profit to be potentially earned by hackers.\nIt’s no longer the norm to protect secrets of the past and attempts to cover up covert operations. Anyone who followed Stuxnet read the reports on the US openly admitting to having created the virus. Adding to the case, now that Duqu has been used, disappeared and morphed, we know that the next cyber weapons are already being tested and developed.\nWhat does this mean for those of us using the technology? First and foremost is that you cannot trust that your systems will ever be free from attacks. What happens when other countries openly admit that they hacked your systems? If this is the new face of war, your systems are fair game. That includes your mobile phones, cars and basically anything with a chip that can be programmed could host new malware.\nIt’s hard to ignore the fact that cybercrime is a booming, global business. Some estimate that the industry pulls in $100 billion a year, while Russian-speaking hackers rake in $4.5 billion alone.\nUnfortunately, this means that the current landscape of cyber war and crime isn’t going anywhere for some time. It’s too profitable of a business, and becoming more and more difficult to avoid. That also speaks to the importance of mitigation services as well.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (451, 'The Three Myths of the Availability Threat', 'Dennis Usle', '2012-6-13', 'Availability – aka the big “A” – is often the overlooked leg of the CIA triad (the others being Confidentiality and Integrity). Perhaps one contributing factor is the common belief among security professionals that if data is not available it is secure. Corporate executives, on the other hand, have a different opinion as downtime carries with it a hefty price tag.\nWhile today’s Corporate Risk Assessment certainly involves the aspect of Availability, it is focused on redundancy, not on security. Penetration tests, a result of the corporate risk assessment, also fail to test on availability security. In fact, pen testing and vulnerability scanning contracts specifically avoid any tests which might cause degradation of service often leaving these vulnerabilities unknown until it’s too late. Availability is commonly handed off to Network Engineering when building resilient networks. Common risk mitigation in this arena include redundant power, Internet links, routers, firewalls, Web farms, storage, and even geographic diversity with use of hot, warm and cold data centers. As you can see, there is a ton of money invested in building network infrastructure to meet corporate availability requirements.\n\nWhile these investments in infrastructure are meaningful they are not impervious to attack. In fact, attacks are often complicated and even exacerbated by the inherent, resilient design of the network. For example, let’s consider a few common myths:\nMyth1: DDOS attacks consume lots of bandwidth and are noisy. We will add additional bandwidth if we come under DDOS attack or we already have enough bandwidth to absorb any attack.  \nA recent study by Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) reports a significant change in the threat landscape from noisy volumetric floods (ex., TCP SYN or UDP Floods) to the application layer (ex., http get and DNS query floods) and slow and low attacks. A volumetric attack can consume any amount of bandwidth you can afford. Admittedly, additional bandwidth may delay the outcome, and if significant, (100 Gbps.+) it might even deter an attacker. However a targeted attack is one in which the attacker is after your business, not your competitor or the guy down the street. He will shift gears to find weakness in your defense, likely in the application layer.\nMyth 2: Route traffic through secondary data center or split the load across data centers.\nLet’s take a DNS flood targeting a DNS server as an example. Some folks I’ve chatted with might consider shifting over to a redundant data center in the event they are flooded at the primary or even operating off a different IP address range for the secondary. Don’t underestimate our enemies because an attack would follow in either event. You might ask why or how the attack would migrate? One possibility would be if you reroute your traffic, the attack would simply follow the target. While changing or using different IP address ranges might buy you some time, security by obscurity is proven not to prevail. In addition, many attacks today target domain names so you would find the attack simply following the DNS change.\nMyth 3: We are safe from this threat because we use a CDN or cloud DDoS scrubbing solution\nWhile CDN and cloud scrubbing centers serve their purposes and can be used as mitigation techniques, they are also not conclusive of an attack mitigation system. By nature of the CDN it can be bypassed by several tools (HULK, LOIC, HOIC, and more), which were purposely built to bypass such protections and utilize dynamically changing URL’s. In fact the CDN will not only leave one wanting for anti-DoS, it’s known to amplify the attack as explained in recent blogs by my colleague, David Hobbs, CDN as a Weapon and You Cant Hide Behind the Clouds. In addition, neither the CDN nor cloud scrubbers can protect against encrypted attacks, unless of course you are willing to share your encryption keys with outsiders.\nAnother disadvantage of the cloud-scrubbing center is that it is usually an on-demand service, which requires rerouting traffic once under attack. Cloud scrubbing typically consists of the several steps upon an attack. It begins with detection, alerting, route change, attack mitigation, verification of legitimate traffic, and finally back to detecting once the attack is over to put traffic back in its normal state. This detection is not a simple feat, even in the case of a network flood in which an administrator may be alerted via email of bandwidth usage on a circuit.\nWhat if they don’t get the email because the email server is being DoS’d? What if the attack is over the weekend and no one notices, except your customers who are trying to purchase equipment from your eCommerce site?\nHumans are the driving force behind targeted attacks that rely on sophisticated tools, C&C and botnets. Stopping these requires attack mitigation tools that can adapt to the changing threat and mitigate based upon suspicious behavior patterns. In conjunction with tactical tools, a sound perimeter counter defense strategy will also include a human factor.\nAs with all layers of security, Availability Security is like a game of chess that requires the right mix of strategy and tactics to defeat the enemy.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'availability\', \'CDN\', \'ddos\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/06/three-myths-availability-threat/');

Flame is able to extract large volumes of information from its victim and send the information back to its operators. The information that Flamer extracts includes key strokes, directory structure, files and documents, activation of audio recording by demand, scan for neighboring Bluetooth devices and much more. \n\nThe method used by Flame operators for initial infection of a victim computer is still unclear, and the assumptions of security specialists vary from network intrusion to physical infection of a computer through USB key. While security companies are still researching methods to block Flame’s initial infection, Radware ERT has generated a signature that blocks Flame spreading attempts within the victim’s organization. It was discovered that Flame is able to spread across a victim’s organization through a sophisticated ‘Man in the Middle attack’ on the Windows Update service. As soon as Flame tries to spread from one infected computer to another, Radware’s Attack Mitigation System identifies the spreading attempt and blocks it. In addition, an immediate alert is sent to the security operation center in the organization, so they become aware that Flame exists in their network. \nOrganizations deploying Radware’s Attack Mitigation System significantly reduce the risk of data extraction by Flame and are notified of its existence as soon as it tries to spread in the organization. In addition there is evidence that Flame may be also be using Microsoft LNK Exploit MS10-046. Radware signatures already protect against its network manifestation of this vulnerability.\n\nERT Recommendations\nInstall the latest signature file from Radware on the DefensePro devices to block Flame spreading attempts. In addition, customers are advised to use host-based protection such as AntiVirus to remove Flame from infected computers, and detect or prevent its host-based activities. \n\nRadware’s customers are encouraged to contact our support team and to receive immediate assistance from our ERT team.

Thanks to advancements in technology, companies can track and analyze customers’ behavior, collecting a multitude of parameters, and store the information to better offer them a more personal experience. On the positive side, end-users get a customized service adapted to his or her preferences – the bank offers customer customized financial tracks; the HMO shows lab results comparisons based on medical history; the social media site delivers content based on location, keywords, and browsing patterns.\nWhile the benefits are undeniable, the explosion of customers’ data storage and use also brings liability to the organizations housing the data. What information, for example, are they collecting and how do they collect it? How are they using this information? Do they share it? How do organizations secure the information and ensure it is kept private?\nBy agreeing to let organizations collect and store their data, customers really mean, “I want to give you my data, but keep it safe; do not share it, because it’s mine. I won’t be happy if you share my secrets.” Customer data disclosure brings customer dissatisfaction, legal suits, financial loss and brand damage. To protect the end-users, governments have enacted regulations such as HIPAA, Sarbanes Oxley, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, and standards like PCI-DSS designed to ensure the safe handling of cardholder information at every step.\nTo avoid data disclosure and make sure the information is secure, organizations should place security controls at multiple levels. Data breaches caused by SQL injection – perhaps the most famous application attack – could seriously harm a company. An SQL injection attack is designed to exploit a web application vulnerability and execute code in the backend database in order to gain access to stored data such as account and credit card numbers or any stored personally identifiable information (PII). An SQL injection attack was used to hack Sony’s Playstation network servers resulting in the theft of millions of users’ passwords, email addresses, home addresses and dates of birth. The attack also managed to take control of Sony admin details, as well as of huge amount of music code. If you add up the damage in terms of customer dissatisfaction, serious brand damage and litigation, experts say the attack may cost Sony $24 billion!\nPerhaps the best source for identifying and blocking such attacks is through web application firewalls (WAF), which provide solid security controls to prevent data leakage and privacy infringement scenarios.\nBut what happens if the WAF can’t block the attack and prevent the data leakage? This is a case in which we may want extra protection on sensitive data. Also, what if there is a requirement for selective display of the sensitive data, like the need to mask the social security numbers display of juveniles while allowing the SSNs display of adults? And last, but not least, the PCI-DSS 3.3 requirement asks for credit card data (PAN – primary account number) masking when account numbers are displayed, a process that is complex and requires costly application modifications.\nThat’s why a web application firewall, like Radware’s AppWall, becomes so important. It accurately stops a multitude of attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and more, providing good security coverage for attacks on known and unknown vulnerabilities (zero-minute attacks). In addition, you can mask selective data such as credit card numbers or other sensitive PII. It offers the possibility to define masking policies on specific parameters for particular users or group of users. This way, the organization could decide what data is visible to whom, masking data selectively, and complying with PCI-DSS 3.3 requirements.\nProtecting your company’s applications and network against cyber attacks like SQL injection is daunting enough without the added concerns of preventing data leakage and privacy infringement. With all the extra information stored on company servers, a web application firewall becomes critical to keeping customers safe and passing regulations, while still getting the full benefit of big data capabilities.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application level\', \'security\', \'WAF\', \'Web Application Firewall\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/05/security-controls-multiple-levels/');

I see this as much more hype than operationally a change.\nWhile, many large organizations have hooked their plans on change over to the ISOC launch date, legions of companies have already been leveraging IPv6 WAN connectivity. Most mobile providers who have adopted LTE 4G infrastructures have built around this networking principle already with mobile devices, by default, connecting to the Internet via IPv6 assignments.\nIt’s well known, however, that a 4G phone must also be 3G compatible and must also be able to regress to IPv4 published websites as not to upset the end-user community. Thus all we really have done, and much to the chagrin of the initial designers, is somehow weave IPv6 into the existing IPv4 Internet.\nBottom line: Because IPv4 is not going away and many estimate that it will take 10 years (or longer) for the natural death of IPv4 to occur, we will essentially live in perpetuity with both designs.\nSo, A New Dawn? Or the Beginning of the End?\nTo be honest, it’s neither. The interoperability issues between IPv4 and IPv6, however, opens a Pandora’s Box of opportunity for those of the nefarious persuasion. Much has been written about this including from my colleague Ron Meyran who addresses specific IPv6 vulnerabilities that will remain and are likely to be with us indefinitely.\nSo, what are the three main takeaways from this event?\nTake away #1: IPv6 will first be implemented on the WAN, IPv4 will continue to remain in the LAN for years to come \nOK, so the ‘big boys’ – Google, Facebook, DNS and CDN providers – are all moving to IPv6 default systems via WAN connectivity. And many, if not most ISP’s are following fast or already there. However, nearly no one has made the transition to IPv6 for LAN. There are many reasons for this, but probably the most notable is that there really is no concept for IPv6 NATing, which would mean that most companies would need to go back to the drawing board for their LAN to transition to IPv6.\nRealizing that IPv6 will be adopted at an ever-increasing rate on the Internet WAN operations, and it will be very slow to take hold for LAN operations, that means this will wreak havoc on perimeter security!\nIf we go back to Ron’s blog post we find out that there really is a huge problem associated with IPv4 and IPv6 co-habitating. The problem is twofold:\nProblem #1 – There is no good security detection or mitigation for encapsulated traffic\nProblem #2 – All of yesterday’s exploits, in theory, can be tunneled through the perimeter if someone knows how to properly package the exploit in today’s new transmission transition packaging\nTake away #2: Like Moose & Deer – IPv6 & IPv4 Don’t Cohabitate Well \nAs I mentioned earlier, IPv6 and IPv4 make insecure bedfellows. There have been no predefined standards in the way to handle the facilitation of the cohabitation of IPv4 with IPv6 so there has been shortage of ‘transition mechanisms’ which have popped up and have been, in most part, widely adopted.\nOnce again, these transition mechanisms facilitate the transitioning of the Internet from its initial IPv4 infrastructure to IPv6. As IPv4 and IPv6 networks are not directly interoperable, these technologies are designed to permit hosts on either network to participate in networking with the opposing network.\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) conducts working groups and discussions through the IETF Internet Drafts and Requests for Comments processes to develop these methods. Some basic IPv6 transition mechanisms have been defined; however nothing has yet emerged as a proposed uniform standard. As such, the world is awash with the mechanisms, which are all over the map but are largely defined in the following categories:\nPlethora of IPv4 to IPv6 (and vice versa) Transition Mechanisms such as the following:\n\nEncapsulating IPv4 in IPv6 (or 4in6)\nEncapsulating IPv6 in IPv4 (or 6in4)\nIPv6 over  IPv4 (6over4)\nDS-Lite\n6rd\n6to4\nISATAP\nNAT64 / DNS64\nTeredo\nSIIT\n\nIf you are familiar with network perimeter security devices, one of the things they do well is deep packet inspection and Stateful aware analysis. However, some of the dirty little secrets is that nearly none of today’s technologies have a capability to inspect encrypted traffic such as SSL (BTW – this is an area where Radware is a true leader), or the ability to inspect tunneling protocols such as L2TP, PPTP, etc.\nWhat IPv4 and IPv6 transition does is effectively exacerbate these “Achilles heels” in security detection capabilities by introducing a whole new category of nearly undetectable transmissions.\nDon’t be fooled by a vendor’s claim that they inspect a v4 packet in v6 or vice versa, because even if true for one or two methodologies, the ways in which to accomplish this task are almost immeasurable today. This is really a true community-wide problem and one that must be addressed.\nOf course, we’ve been looking at this conundrum for a while and have some strong solutions which often require some trade-offs. What controls don’t?\nOh, one tangential thought: No scanners or vulnerability software is yet ready to provide you with visibility to the encapsulated transmission problem either – uggh!\nSo, what is the risk associated with ignoring this threat?\nTake away #3: Meet your old vulnerability – Same as the new vulnerability!\nMuch of our defense is single threaded, and should an adversary be able to pass through your perimeter defenses, many of the ‘older’ vulnerabilities would find a receptive home having passed through the ‘corporate scrubbers.’\nMoreover, just think of the new opportunities available to more nefarious organizations that don’t have your interests in mind.\nThis ‘transition mechanism’ essentially becomes an effective ‘unscrubbed’ gateway or tunnel for all newly developed organized crime-designed, state-sponsored, and Hacktivist-motivated attacks.\nMoreover, most of us will be largely blind to these realities unless you are acting now to make certain that your gateways are designed with all encapsulated traffic being detected and mitigated. Anomaly detection takes center stage here and signature tools will leave you wanting.\nAnd one last thought: This problem requires action on behalf of security professionals to solve; you HAVE to do something differently because the inertia path will leave you vulnerable. \nIn summary\nIPv4 to IPv6 migrations are not the end of the world, nor are their interoperability solutions a panacea either! Go forward with caution and please don’t hesitate to reach out should you need a helping hand to navigate these waters!\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'IPv6\', \'IPv6 threats\', \'Perimeter Protection\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/05/three-security-considerations-ipv6/');

It got me thinking about the potential for hackers to really abuse this flaw in spreadsheets and hyperlinks to take web properties offline and cause financial pain.\nSo, the idea Anonymous or, say, an aggressive competitor could use against a target could be this:\n\nWebcrawl the victim/target/competitor’s web site and get all of the URL links from their site.\nAdd every single link into Google Docs with =image(“url”) in cells.\nGoogle Docs (we haven’t tested other “office” type of applications) refresh the data every hour.\nImagine if a CDN was in play, this could exponentially raise the cost of using the CDN. We call this FDoS, short for Financial Denial of Service.\nOpen up 100 Google accounts and repeat the process over and over, until the site crashes from pure traffic load from Google or other hosted provider.\n\nSo, now the second scenario is using a pure non-hosted spreadsheet as the second weapon. You can use embedded code inside of a spreadsheet as explained here. This means, that you could set up queries from the site, to do heavy database searches, over and over and over and over. So the attack would look like this:\n\nCreate an .iqy file to go along with the spreadsheet so that it knows how to access the web code: WEB 1 http://www.myserver.com/MonthlySales.asp Month=[“Month”,”Enter month (1-12).”] .\nRepeat the queries over and over and over, finding the heaviest searches possible.\nDistribute the excel spreadsheet everywhere, the more queries used, the heavier the abuse of the server.\nIf that spreadsheet were to get spammed all over the place with some social engineering like “Private Financials for Obama.xls” and hit a few million e-mail boxes, the implications could be very serious. Even preview functions from Yahoo or other online mail systems could cause Yahoo or others to potentially load all of the links.\n\nI see this threat being a really menacing problem for the following likely vicims:\n\nGovernments / Politicians: This technique could be used for websites asking for updates or financial contributions\nSocial Media Companies: Could be deluged with erroneous data\nMilitary: Could this be used during times of conflict to ‘hide” a true attack by flooding the environment with garbage first?\nGaming Sites\nAnd Plenty More\n\nNow, how about the purveyors of the data? Doesn’t this also adversely affect companies who offer these services such as the following:\n\nGoogle Docs\nDropbox\nSnapfish\nMicrosoft Office Live\nDocStock\nAnd Many Others\n\nAs you can see, with a little creativity, there could be other exploits developed, possibly using document files, PDF files, etc. The possibilities are very wide open on how to use common every day formats of information exchange and hosting solutions to become weapons for DDoS.

Hacktivists have been very effective launching attacks on government websites and their motivation increases with each successful attack. Even TIME Magazine included Anonymous in their “100 Most Influential People List”, which definitely emboldens the number of politically or socially motivated DDoS attacks against these offensing websites.\nToday, cyber-attacks have become the latest weapon in the arsenal of social protest. Those unhappy with governments or political policies have traditionally shown their passion in the streets. Protest leaders work to congregate large numbers of people together physically where they parade for long hours in front of the symbolic building in all kinds of weather. This is difficult work that requires recruiting, organizing and bussing protesters to the site with no guarantee of getting the massive numbers necessary to attract media attention. Why bother when it is possible to launch a virtual protest that often gets wider and more intense media coverage than any local street demonstrations?\nWith all these politically motivated attacks in the news, I decided to check with Radware’s ERT (Emergency Response Team) to see if their experiences showed an increase in government cases over the past weeks. The ERT handles dozens of security cases every week involving Radware customers from all over the world. I found that there were three times as many anti-government cyber-attacks during the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the last quarter of 2011.\nSince it is much easier to launch a cyber protest than it is to organize masses of people for street demonstrations, there is more incentive to use DDoS attacks as the weapon of choice. We expect to see more government websites under attacks in the coming months, which only means that government agencies should reevaluate their cyber-attack mitigation strategy and prepare themselves to combat today’s security threats.\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anonymous\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'ERT\', \'government\', \'hacktivism\', \'political\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/05/why-bother-to-demonstrate/');

To be certain fewer soldiers materialized, and those who did participate were met with even less meaningful impact on their targets than previous efforts.\nHowever, not all was lost. Of the virtual soldiers who decided to pick up their digital battle-axes, they provided enough energy for notable mayhem at a few of the world’s leading organizations.\nRadware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) handled record volumes of engagements and attack mitigation, including assistance to the following organizations over the past five days:\n\nFour International Telecoms\nA Top-Five World Wide Trading Exchange\nA Major International Bank\nA Major Cloud Provider\nA Major Credit Card / Financial Transaction Processor\nTwo International Government Entities\nAn International consumer products website\nAn International e-Commerce Company\n\nThe attack fury was notable in both size and the range of the industries targeted. It appears on the surface that each of the 12 above mentioned organizations had somehow recently grieved one Anon faction or another. Anon seemed to use Operation Blackout as the backdrop to their newly designed attacks. The fact that Operation Blackout was not meaningful only brought these sundry attacks further to the forefront.\nAlso, a couple of other items of note as there were other strange attributes worth mentioning. First, much of the anticipated attacks on the world’s DNS infrastructure appear to have been bypassed. Operation Blackout appeared to be more of a ruse for your ‘attack du jour’ than a dedicated effort against DNS root servers. Moreover, the apparent attack sophistication and volume levels of those attacks which were directed at DNS servers were not notable or effective over the weekend.  \n\nBusiest Attack Week of The Year Brings New Attack Vectors\nAs mentioned above, Radware’s industry-leading ERT has been busier than ever!\nIn the month of March, the ERT team has not only been conscripted to assist institutions defend themselves against Hacktivists of all flavors and desires, but they have also witnessed first hand changes in attack techniques and a tools in which attackers are choosing to use above all others.

INSERT INTO `radware` (`id`, `title`, `author`, `publish_date`, `content`, `tags`, `url`) VALUES (459, 'Batten Down The Hatches: Anonymous – Coming Soon to Your Network', 'Dennis Usle', '2012-3-30', 'As security professionals facing the rising tide of threats, many of us find ourselves researching and implementing next-generation perimeter defenses to mitigate risks.  Through analysis of threat vs. protection we quickly realize that no single protection will suffice; current risks require multiple protection layers to secure the business.\nTypical intrusion prevention services (IPS) and next generation firewall (NGFW) devices claim coverage, but beware – they fall short.  In fact recent studies from Radware’s 2011 Global Application & Network Security Report show combined IPS and FW account for 32% of the common DDoS bottleneck.\n\nAlso realize next Generation IPS and DDoS tools are not created equal. Products on the market differ tremendously across the board from detection to mitigation. One major difference is due to the fact that many vendors are now jumping on the DDoS bandwagon and creating products with no real functionality, but advertising them none the less. As you move forward with your evaluation and selection of attack mitigation systems, I suggest you review the following criteria:\nHardware Architecture Designed for Perimeter Attack Mitigation: Hardware designed to withstand network floods such as SYN, RST, ICMP and UDP Floods is essential. Throughout 2011 and continuing into 2012, a significant increase in both network and application layer denial of service attacks were observed. Freely available tools have enabled the enemy to leverage sophisticated attacks in a very simple to use interface. Ensure the hardware you select can perform detection and mitigation techniques to meet your network availability requirements. Look beyond the vendors’ marketing and validate the claim.\nEase of Deployment: Deployment options should be flexible to allow for the ability to deploy with little to no impact on operations. Common options include inline and out of path. Be cautions of out of path options which rely on flow (netflow/cflow) based information as they are not capable of detecting application and slow and low attacks.\nWhen Flow based technologies do detect an attack, it requires several minutes to detect and swing traffic in which case the firewall or IPS would likely have already crashed under high PPS floods. Out of path options require re-routing traffic to the mitigation device when under attack. Out of path flow-based attack mitigation solutions are more expensive due to separate detection and mitigation components and the complexity of deployment and support requires significantly more effort. On the other hand, in-line deployments provide detection and mitigation within the same appliance, which can mitigate attacks in real time and offer ease of deployment, further reducing total cost of ownership.\nLow False Positive – High Quality of User Experience: Most vendors claim a low false positive rate though many of us have learned otherwise and realize security tools are not black boxes. More specifically, IPS and security incident event management (SIEM) event correlation systems require many hours of initial and ongoing tuning. Identify exactly how the vendor is reducing false positives and benign events. Ensure they do so while avoiding false negatives (real incidents which go unnoticed).\nThe behavioral analysis or heuristics algorithms in use should scale with fluctuations in bandwidth and accommodate flash crowds (legitimate business). Verify that the mitigation appliance does not drop legitimate traffic when under attack. Consider replaying live traffic through the device while simulating attack traffic or have the vendor do it for you in their lab.\nMulti-Tenancy: Multi-Tenancy is often a concern for managed service providers and corporations where different business units can have different requirements. Ensure configuration of polices can be segmented. Verify granular end user reporting (reporting per policy), real time monitoring and alerting is available. Functionality within an existing portal or management station may be required; verify there is an API available to accommodate.\nGranularity of Configuration: Opposing security controls may need to be applied to different functional areas of the network. Configuration of network security policies should be capable of being segmented with different customers, business units or environments. For instance customer A should have capability to have a distinct separate policy than customer B. In addition policies should be capable of different protection actions – For instance a policy in block with another in report only mode.\nDDOS Protection: Perimeter Attack Mitigation Systems should be capable of withstanding high rate TCP/UDP floods and slow and low attacks. A significant trend has been identified on the application layer attacks and a strong emphasis should be placed on analyzing the full OSI stack (all 7 layers). Some vendors rely on netflow information to identify network anomalies and are not able to detect application layer or slow and low attacks. Tools such as LOIC, HOIC, RefRef, THC-SSL and ApacheKiller have surfaced publicly and are contributing to the rise of application layer DDoS attacks. Ensure your vendor has protections to detect and identify attack tools, validate malicious sources and block both known vulnerability and zero day network and application exploits.\nNetwork Behavior Analysis (NBA): Network Behavior Analysis is the secret sauce for identifying anomalies in the network and identifying zero day attacks. It is imperative to understand how NBA is implemented and how false positives are avoided. Behavior analysis should be both network (TCP/UDP) and application aware to protect critical services such as ftp, smtp, http, SSL, DNS, and SIP. Proper behavior analysis mechanisms should only trigger when there is a difference in the traffic ratios and not cause false positives under flash crowd or increases in bandwidth.\nChallenge / Response Mechanisms to validate clients: Many attacks today are carried out with weaponized tools. Challenging the attacker provides the ability to filter out the attack traffic and permit only the legitimate clients. There should be challenge and response mechanism in place to protect both network and application layers such as DNS, HTTP and SSL.\nReconnaissance and Brute Force Protections: The attack mitigation system should provide protections from known vulnerabilities, (IPS signatures), brute force and reconnaissance scanning. These detections should detect and mitigate vulnerability assessments, network scanning tools and malware spreading.\nWeb Application Vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection, etc.): It is common place for cyber attackers to deface and alter website content, steal confidential and personal information. Due to the vast and frequent vulnerabilities found in web applications it is critical that patches be applied. It is a timely process, however, and often not done. In this case, web application firewalls are the tool of choice; verify your vendor can prevent the OWASP vulnerabilities such as XSS, SQL injections, etc.\nReporting and Alerting: As with any security device it is essential to have a sound reporting engine to show return on investment. Internal log collection, correlation, alerting and reporting should be available within the device management systems, as well as have an API to integrate with existing infrastructure such as syslog servers, SIEM and network monitoring systems. Identify the ability to create and export reports in the required format (pdf, csv, etc.,) and delivery options (ftp, email, etc.). Security devices should be capable of being monitored remotely via SNMP, and ability to send alerts to syslog, SNMP traps, and email.\nSupport/Emergency Response Team: Identify the vendor support structures and ensure they meet the level of support you require. During testing or proof of concept, test the TAC at different hours of the day and days of the week. Identify who to contact when under attack along with associated cost structures and availability. Ensure there is a clear, escalated procedure backed by an SLA to follow when you are under attack.\nCapex/Opex Costs: Equipment should be capable of on-demand upgrades to scale beyond current needs without replacing or adding additional gear causing additional expenses and network down time. Consider the complications of out of path (expensive) vs. inline mentioned in the ease of deployment section above.\nCustomer References: There is no better reference than an existing customer who can validate a vendor’s claims for preventing multi-vector attacks. Request to speak with a few customers in relevant business size and scope. Evaluate the overall pre and post sales experience especially under attack.\nThird Party Reviews and NSS Labs Certifications: Research third party certifications and reviews; NSS Labs is a reputable third party research group that performs evaluations of many security products. Go online and research from reputable sources, the more the better.\nLike no other, Radware’s Attack Mitigation System (AMS) includes protection mechanisms to mitigate the emerging risks through the combined use of IPS, DDoS Protection, Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA), Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Reputation services on hardware that has been tailored for the task.

A successful attack against DNS servers will result in halt of all Internet based services.\n\nAnonymous Attacking Tools\nIn order to achieve the ambitious goal of shutting down the Internet, Anonymous is planning to use a sophisticated reflective amplified DNS flood, generated using a DNS attack tool named “ramp.” “Ramp” is designed to harness the processing and bandwidth resources of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as well as other corporate DNS services to shutdown the DNS core.\nUsing “ramp,” Anonymous advocates will flood their ISPs and other DNS servers with DNS queries in which the source IP is spoofed and it matches the IP address of one of the DNS root servers (see step 1 in the diagram below). The ISP DNS servers will response to these malicious queries by sending the answer to the spoofed source, i.e to the DNS Root servers(step 2 in the diagram).\nThe amplified effect of this attack is achieved by generating DNS reponses that are ten times larger than the original DNS queries.\n\nFearing of law-enforcement agencies’ ability to track the physical source of even spoofed source attacks, Anonymous urged their follower to use the TOR anonymized network. However, since the TOR network has limited bandwidth resources, Anonymous must amplify the attack using the ârampâ tool in order to succeed in their mission.\nRadware DNS DDoS Mitigation Solution\nTo successfully mitigate the threats discussed above, DNS attack mitigation tools must meet very unique challenges. Radware AMS is the industryâs first DNS DDoS mitigation solution that meets these unique challenges:\nMitigation tools must have deep knowledge of DNS traffic behavior â Radware AMS understands DNS traffic and learns it normal behavior continually, so it immediately identifies abnormal DNS traffic. Moreover, Radware AMS analyzes every field in DNS traffic to identify abnormal packets and to create its real time signatures in high accuracy.\nMitigating high rate of DNS packets â Utilizing its DoS Mitigation Engine (DME), a network processor based hardware accelerator, Radware AMS can challenge 2M DNS queries per second and to process up to 12 million packets per second of attack traffic. The attack traffic does not affect Radware AMS capabilities to handle legitimate traffic and it can handle multi-gigabit of legitimate throughput traffic under attack.\nMitigation accuracy â With unique DNS challenges and accurate analyzing of DNS traffic behavior, Radware AMS provides a very accurate distinguish between legitimate DNS traffic and attack-based DNS traffic results in minimal false positives. This enables the service provider to continue and serve its legitimate users even under severe attack.\nProvide best quality of experience even under attack â Radware AMS unique architecture that is based on several hardware engines and accelerators guarantees a minimum latency to all processed traffic, and especially to the legitimate traffic. This guarantees a best quality of experience to legitimate internet users even under attack.\nA detailed description of Radwareâs solution for mitigating DNS attacks can be found here.\nContact Our DNS Advisory Team\nISPs and other DNS service providers should protect themselves from the planned attacks. The threat of effecting Internet services by shutting down local or national ISP DNS servers is more likely to happen than affecting the global DNS Root servers.\nRadware created a 24×7 DNS advisory team to help our customers and prospects get themselves ready for Operation Blackout. This team provides a detailed explanation of the threats and how to best prepare your DNS critical infrastructure and your mitigation solutions for the coming attacks.\nRadwareâs customers are encouraged to contact our support team and to get an immediate help from our DNS advisory team.

Tools such as LOIC, RUDY, RefRef, Slowloris, etc., are not listed on the common vulnerability exposure (CVE) register as they are tools. Yet most companies don’t know if these new ‘weapon systems’ can pierce their current defenses.\n2. Improve security of critical architectures.\n√Knowing where the holes are in your current architecture allows you to adopt remediation procedures that close them. Radware helps you tighten security by identifying gaps and recommending solutions.\n3. Strengthen your response capability for security attacks (e.g. DDoS, Server Cracking, Web Application Attacks, Debilitating Scans, Nefarious Transaction Inputs, etc.).\n√By highlighting areas of improvement, you can greatly enhance the quality of event response plans.\n4. Increase the effectiveness of security initiatives.\n√Can you bring someone to justice if you undergo an attack? Gain valuable insight into your organization’s security posture and ensure the highest levels of readiness.\n5. Test your current incident detection methods.\n√What are your current methods for monitoring security incidents to ensure your approach is both comprehensive and effective.\nHigh likelihood that “Availability” Vulnerabilities have not been enumerated: \nIt’s a new dawn and security professionals are waking up to the cold, hard fact that that ‘Availability’ based vulnerabilities remain untested or ruled not meaningful since the inception of routine testing. It’s true that for years, the standard penetration testing and vulnerability assessments did not scope in “Service Disrupting” vulnerabilities as part of the testing regimen. In addition, when, by chance, an Availability based vulnerability was enumerated, the standard assignment of this class of threat was ‘low’ or ‘informational.’\nIt appears that the nefarious underworld has turned their development efforts towards the sad fact that we have summarily disregarded a whole category of threats because they were either inconvenient to test or the tools themselves were inadequate for measuring these problems.\nSo, What are “Availability” Vulnerabilities?\nTo technically assess diagnosis a problem, we must first know what it is.\nShould you need a nice definition, read here where I made the case that availability problems are paramount.\nMy point, which I hope we can all agree, is that information security threats to an organization revolve around the following problems: \n\nReal-Time Protection against Volumetric Attacks\nApplication Protections Against Application Layer (L7) Outages\nBehavioral Protections (e.g., non-signature based) Protecting Critical Servers and Services\nSignature-based (IPS) & Reputation Services Coverage and Quality \nEffectiveness of from existing malware propagation and scanning Protection tools\n\nDDoS threat only? No Way! The rising role of Web Applications in Availability!\nAny assessment of an organization’s availability risks would be remiss if they focused only on DDoS threats. Any logical Availability security assessment will determine the appropriateness of role and rights assignments to specific user classes and how these assignments are controlled. Practices such as the following need to be thoroughly reviewed:\n\nPoor Logging Practices – Many web application logs contain sensitive information such as passwords, session IDs, and other codes. A strong logging design is key to a secure web application.\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws – The web application can be used as a mechanism to transport an attack to an end user’s browser. A successful attack can disclose the end user’s session token, attack the local machine, or spoof content to fool the user.\nBuffer Overflows – Web application components in some languages that do not properly validate input can be crashed and, in some cases, used to take control of a process. These components can include common gateway interfaces (CGI), libraries, drivers, and web application server components.\nCommand Injection Flaws – Web applications pass parameters when they access external systems or the local operating system. If an attacker can embed malicious commands in these parameters, the external system may execute those commands on behalf of the web application.\nBroken Thread Safety – Web applications are highly concurrent, and thread safety problems can result in significant security issues. Concurrent programming is one of the most difficult aspects of developing secure web applications.\nWeb and Application Server Misconfiguration  – Having a strong server configuration standard is critical to a secure web application. These servers have many configuration options that affect security and are not secure out of the box.\nRemote Administration Flaws – Many web applications allow administrators to access the site using a web interface. If these administrative functions are not very carefully protected, an attacker can gain full access to all aspects of a site.\n\nAuditors Must Change to Adapt to the New Landscape!!\nSo, as you can tell, Availability-based risks are a big problem and need a serious set of auditing and control procedures to both measure, monitor and protect!\nTo reiterate, any assessment of an organization’s Availability risks would be remiss if they focused only on DDoS threats. Any logical Availability security assessment will determine the appropriateness of role and rights assignments to specific user classes, and how these assignments are controlled.

Computer hacking and DDoS attacks are no longer reserved for the small group of individuals who are familiar with the “bits and bytes” of underlying technologies. Today’s attackers may very well be ordinary computer users.\nThis is a result of an abundance of tools out there which do not require technical abilities surpassing the normal usage of a program, or simply the supplying of a credit card. A recent example is the Anonymous-OS which has been recently released. This is an Ubuntu- based OS which is pre-installed with all the necessary, and easy to use tools for the novice Anonymous member.\nToday, with a quick search one could easily ‘hire’ – or employ – DDoS on any target, as a service. One of the examples is the Darkness (Optima) bot that has become very popular since 2011. This bot was used in DDoS service offerings in various community sites. In fact, we have seen its usage in several recent attacks handled by Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT).\nThe Darkness DDoS bot belongs to a family of DDoS orientated kits which have been competing for DoS paid attacks lately. It is capable of launching TCP, HTTP, and fragmented ICMP floods. All are specifically designed to cause as much damage as possible. The bot also incorporates a password stealer module which sends sensitive data to the command and control machine.\nAnalysis of the available attacks shows some interesting characteristics. The HTTP vector allows attacking several URL’s at once, thus generating requests specifically for heavy resources on the target web server. The ICMP attack generates a maximum sized ICMP data portion which targets the saturation of the stack’s buffer.\nAlthough they are customizable to some extent, all attacks have some distinct characteristics, which may be deduced from the behavioral patterns they generate in the attacking traffic, specific traffic ordering and content of the traffic generated. You can read a full report on the Darkness bot in the “Radware Technical Notes” found here.\nA possible protection strategy against all possible attack vectors of the Darkness bot should include a combination of network and HTTP DDoS protection which is based on behavioral patterns together with static patterns.

After all, many organizations pay good money to deploy high performance security and risk teams and expect them to stay on top of questions like these.\nHowever, please understand that I have over 15 years in providing and conducting penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, and today’s STANDARD SECURITY TESTING DOES NOT TEST FOR AVAILABILITY ISSUES!! \nSo, given that, how does one assess the likelihood of falling prey to an attacker or being victorious in mitigating the attack?\n \nAn Epiphany \nWhat will it take for most security professionals to recognize that the problem all companies are having fighting Hacktivists is THEIR problem too?!? Yes,  if you’re doing the same thing today with your security program that you were doing 24 months ago – this “old way” of DDoS protection just isn’t working in protecting environments from ideological-based or “Hacktivist” attacks.\nThat model DOES NOT WORK!\n \nAcknowledge that risks HAVE changed – – Have You?\nFor the last 18 months security professionals around the globe have watched as a group of cyber hacktivists dismantled the web defenses of some of the most respected financial and ecommerce sites and “walked right into” their secure data bases and holdings to make a statement.\nThese attacks were not the work of the numerous and very prolific organized crime syndicates whose botnets are constantly prowling and seeking network vulnerabilities to exploit for criminal financial gain, but, instead, they stem from a group of hacktivists who happened to disagree with these particular companies adherence to a governmental request.\n \nIdeological Threats require – Big “A” Thinking  \nAvailability security is different than security confidential data and making transactions with high integrity.\nThis is the threat landscape all network service providers face today, not just on a day-to-day basis but every minute-by minute.  Many forms of attacks on your network are known and more easily defeated but the most daunting attacks are those whose form is not known, not yet seen or perhaps not yet recognized. There are also the attacks that are known, but the modes in which the attacks are leveraged are not known. That is why perimeters are successfully being compromised. In the case of most of the recent attacks, the customary way of deploying security technology is not able to defend against these new attackers.\n \nSo – – What is the new model?\nTo be effective, a defense system must first be able to identify the attack as it is forming or in process of attacking the network. Second, it must determine which incoming traffic has a malicious intent and which is traffic is legitimate. The legitimate traffic must be allowed to pass so that commerce can still be conducted and the illegitimate traffic must be quarantined from the rest of the network and dispensed.  In addition, a network defense system must cope with various and multiple attacks in real time.\nStandard network-security solutions depend on static signature protection against known application-vulnerability exploits and rate-based protection against high-volume attacks and unknown attacks. Static signature-protection technology, deployed by Network-IPS, firewalls, and anti-viruses, can only identify predefined attacks. This type of traditional perimeter security relies on periodic signature updates, leaving the business vulnerable to zero-minute attacks, and offers no solution against non-vulnerability–based attacks.\nRate-based technology is designed to suppress abnormal traffic patterns. This technology is deployed as means of mitigating high-volume attacks or zero-minute attacks. However, a rate-based solution does not differentiate between attack traffic and legitimate traffic. Packets and sessions, good and bad, above predefined thresholds are dropped. Rate-based technology offers no protection against lower-rate attacks (for example, brute-force attacks, low rate malware propagation, slow network and application probes). Furthermore, rate-based technology cannot prevent improper-use scenarios where attack traffic such as an HTTP page flood appears identical to legitimate application requests as in a flash crowd.\nComing Soon:  Part II:  The Rise of the “Availability Vulnerabilities”\nIn my next post I will address the specific vulnerabilities required to be tested in order to develop some reasonableness to the efficacy of an internal control infrastructure.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'availability\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Hacktivist\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/03/ddos-yourself-first/');

The purpose of the campaign is mainly to recruit additional members and volunteers to amplify the DDoS attack and to generate large volume of traffic in order to shut down the victimâs website and online services.\nHowever, this pattern might have changed. Â Last week attacks that were launched by Anonymous on several Italian organizations reveal a new behavioral pattern for the hacktivists group:\n\n\nNo public campaign before the attack:Â Unlike previous attacks, in the recent attack there was not a campaign to recruit volunteers and additional computes to perform the attack. This group of Anonymous believes that they can take down a website without a massive number of attackers.\nNo early warning:Â An early warning before the cyber attack starts is a bonus for the victim and it allows the victim to take actions to minimize its damage. However, the last attack did not have an early warning and did not allow any pre-attack cautions.\nSmall number of hackers launch the attack:Â Since there was no public campaign before the attack started the number of hackers who launched the attack was fairly small. This attack was invoked by several hackers, probably located near from the victim, and they were very coordinated in their activities.\nSmall number of attacking bots:Â In previous Anonymous attacks, many hundreds of bots were used to take down the victimâs online services, but in this case only several dozens of bots were involved, launching a very effective, mid-volume attack on the victimâs website servers.\nÂ Changing attack methods during the attack:Â The Anonymous attackers activated at least four different attack methods during the attack and they switched between the methods when they realized that a method has been mitigated. Each method involves different attack tools and requires unique mitigation techniques.\n\nLessons Learned\nHigh-profile organizations and businesses that are the target of Anonymous they may not receive a public campaign before an attack on them nor be given an early warning.Â  They also may face more sophisticated attacks that can be launched by a small group of hackers with limited number of attacking bots. In addition, the attackers will use multiple attack methods and will switch between them during the attack to maximize their effectiveness. Therefore, organizations should adopt a comprehensive attack mitigation solution that can respond in real time and mitigate various attack vectors.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anonymous\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/03/anonymous-attacks-big-crowd-not-needed/');

This operation has been launched in response to perceived attacks on free speech and thoughts.\n\nForget for the moment the annoying little fact that it is a myth that there are 13 root servers and let’s focus on much of the response to this threat.\nA New Internet “Underworld”\nThus far, I have been surprised to find that much of my brethren in the security world have put forth well heeled articles which have contributed nicely to the “Common Body of Knowledge” on the topic, however most, if not all, don’t take the threat seriously. Most, like the fantastic blog at Errata Security focused on the previous failed attempts to take down these servers and how things have improved and fundamentally changed since then. There seems to be an agreement that conducting such an attack would be nearly impossible to do.\nAs it so happens, as with most events like these, the contrarian viewpoint is something which I really enjoy entertaining and I believe there are more than a couple of causes for concerns from which we should all take notice.\nOperation Blackout Has a Son: Operation Darknet\nFirst, Operation Blackout seems to be well organized; in fact, it has even provided a nice venue to launch Operation Darknet Operation Darknet is really a different effort for Anonymous because it is not focused on attacks, but rather instead to build something new. This new ‘product’ is meant to design ‘a new, underworld Internet’ – one based on the principle of non-repudiation which, of course, provides anonymity.\nAdvantages of Anonymous\nBoth of the Operations discussed lean heavily on the historical advantages in which Anonymous has leveraged. They are as follows:\n\nAdvantage #1: Passion- – The will to fight. As we all know, a key ingredient in all successful battles.\nAdvantage #2: Keen Knowledge / Intelligence – – Anonymous ‘members’ are contributing from all vantage points, and NO DOUBT have inside architectural knowledge of how worldwide DNS root servers are technically run, designed, protected and the assumptions which go into that model.\nAdvantage #3: Endless resources – Anonymous’ resources limits are matched with the passion around the topic in which they engage. All indications are that many believe this effort to be among the Holy Grail of new would-be “Anon General-Wanna-Bes.” Just the thought of earning bona fides in demonstrating at once a technical prowess and an ideology compliant to the Anon masses is emotionally intoxicating for many. Like they say, “Idle Hands = Devil’s Workshop”\n\nIs the DNS Infrastructure Vulnerable?\nSo, if you are like me and have read all of the industry GURUs and seem to understand that logic states that the “DNS House” should not fall, then why do I feel uneasy at night?\nHistory being the judge, I will always place safe bets with the passionate fighters for a cause over the comfortable defenders of a fortress.\nPossible Vulnerabilities\nLike the famous attacks of Attila-the-Hun’s simple log-battering ram taking down Roman fortresses or the world renowned Trojan horse scenarios, I suspect that our DNS infrastructure have more than one vulnerability which has either been overlooked or assumed inconsequential.\nNow, far be it for me to design out a detailed target list for Anon group members, however the following is a simple list of vulnerability categories, which I would fret if I owned security at any of these environments:\n\n\nMajor Vulnerability #1: DNS IPv6 Vulnerabilities. Much has been written about IPv6 vulnerabilities, however Networkworld.com has done a great job cataloging the most egregious, of which, many are of a DNS persuasion. Here are my top three IPv6 areas for concern;\n\nFrom the Networkworld.com article (linked above) one can clearly see the production of numerous zero-day attacks including the lurking “DNS Quad-A attack” scenarios\nIPv6 is the common WAN routing for DNS infrastructure today and the protocol is ‘heavy’ – – meaning the header requires 4x the amount of processing then the IPv4 routing parity for processing. This ‘stack processing burden’ makes the successful launch of DDoS floods very feasible as this unique situation whereby processing requirements have gone up, however underlying processing speed and memory has not dramatically increased.\nIPv4 and IPv6 can be encapsulated within each other and there really are so many ways to do this that boggles the mind and makes for a Pandora’s box of new exploit transportation opportunities (btw – – there are few detection mechanisms in place for this scenario today).\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMajor Vulnerability # 2: A vulnerability was discovered in common DNS (BIND, DJBDNS, MS, OpenDNS) servers, which allows for a cached domain record to remain active after being deleted. This is not considered a bug rather a flaw in the design of DNS; there is no ETA on a fix from any vendor. This has potential to discredit/bypass url based remediation efforts by vendors such as RSA. This could also expose our relatively short expiration of url from the RSA feed signatures. The extent of the exposure for users of BIND or other affected software is this: every resource record in the Domain Name System hierarchy has a time-to-live (TTL) value associated with it, intended to control how long the information in the resource record can be kept in cache by a non-authoritative server. Dr. Haixin Duan, from Tsinghua University, discloses a method whereby information can be prolonged in the cache beyond the period supposedly allowed by the TTL value, causing affected resolvers to potentially return incorrect answers. It does not allow arbitrary insertion, removal, or alteration of resource record data.\nShould you be interested in following up with the industry common vulnerability exploit (CVE) / and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) comments they can be read here and here.\n\n\n \n\n\nMajor Vulnerability #3: Insider Threat. For some reason the world has yet to take notice that the way to fight Ideological based DDoS attacks is totally different than fighting financial loss or compliance regulations. Ideological based attacks solicit sympathizers who may be lured at any moment for pleasure or personal gain and may be willing to release or act in conspiracy with a cause. What if Operation Blackout literally had resources from inside the DNS core infrastructure today? Sound crazy? Not so fast! Over the past 18 months has been a disturbing trend of either current or former information security professionals who have joined the cause (at least for a time) in pursuit of ‘justice’ or some ‘payback’ while others are real ideological conscripts.\n\n\n \n\nMajor Vulnerability #4: Social Engineering. Who needs conscription and conspiracy when I can have unsuspecting collaborators instead? Nearly every major damaging hack/attack over the past 24 months, which was NOT ideological, has a common first entry tactic which was focused on social engineering vulnerabilities. From RSA and a phished email to the Nuclear Reactors in Iran who were ‘given’ infected USB thumb drives, social engineering tactics are formidable and real. Since the root DNS servers are physically distributed around the world and technically mirrored as nearly one collective, it’s not hard to conceptualize a socially engineered entry point, which leverages the resiliency of the DNS system to spread an ‘internal’ attack and hollow out the system from within. While everyone is expecting a massive noisy attack, the system may degrade from inside.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', 'None', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/02/operation-blackout/');

SSL is a secure tunnel that hackers like to use to mask their behavior.\nSome large CDN providers have over 35,000 caches distributing content.Â They use a âmapâ for most companies in a parent-child relationship.Â For example letâs say I have a Seattle Datacenter with a web server. My IP address is 207.1.1.10 and it maps to http://www.davidhsite.com. The CDN provider would then map 10-15 parent caches that would fetch from the origin server(s) that are nearby my datacenter. Then, the 35,000 caches would feed from those 10-15 parent caches.\nNow, if Anonymous knows that my IP is at 207.1.1.10, what prevents them from just attacking my origin server?Â  You may think, âWeâll just block the world at the firewall and only let our CDN providerâs Map in.âÂ  OK, how do you test your site? What if your CDN provider is introducing a bug?\nRemember my blog post on Using CDNâs as a Weapon for DDoS?Â  Those 10-15 parent caches would have to KNOW EVERY URL to whitelist the site against a random application attack.\nHereâs another example: Go to each of the 35,000 nodes with your script, do a âgetâ for:\nRandom[5-27 length ,a-z,0-9].html, pragma no-cache, cache-control: no cache. Â  Â \nThat still allows you to execute a DDoS attack tool on the site very easily.Â About 35,000 edge caches can easily overwhelm the parent caches as well as requests to the origin server.\nNext, if we understand the services of the CDN provider, one could potentially abuse their systems by manipulating their custom headers and who knows what kind of mischief Anonymous could use with some of these:\nPragma: cdnprovider-x-cache-on, cdnprovider-x-cache-remote-on, cdnprovider-x-check-cacheable, cdnprovider-x-get-cache-key, cdnprovider-x-get-extracted-values, cdnprovider-x-get-nonces, cdnprovider-x-get-ssl-client-session-id, cdnprovider-x-get-true-cache-key, cdnprovider-x-serial-no\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nWe have seen these kinds of attacks recently in some high-profile and high-visibility attacks around the world.Â  While there is plenty of value from the CDN providers and edge caching services, you should know what they can and cannot do.

I view my role in life metaphorically as I envision a Medical Doctor’s role – – trying to best deploy the highest efficacy of a ‘solution’ towards an ailment.\nThe Practice of Information Security\nWhere Doctors have ‘diseases’ and ‘ailments,’ we security folk have ‘risks’ and ‘vulnerabilities’ which need addressing. Where Doctors prescribe drugs and healthy living regimens (diet, exercise, lifestyle changes), we prescribe architectures, configurations, policies and tools. Where Doctors use routine checkups and diagnostic tests to sample progress, we use audits, assessments, alerts and SIEMs to gauge progress. Where Doctors have emergency rooms for acute triage, we leverage incident response teams and real time attack mitigation techniques to address the acute issues of the day.\nThe Idea of Information Security\nIn as such, I am beholden to no idea, schema, architecture, model, product or company in the practice of information security.\nIn fact, I see the practice of information as a constant struggle between the classic deployment of models & controls and the eventual decay in those models to the point whereby self-renewal is required in order to gain an advantage in the classic world of “chess” we play with nefarious actors.\nConfidentiality – Integrity – Availability\nWith that, today I would like to speak to all those who also see themselves as true security professionals and who partake in the daily fight to bring strong security to their employers. To those folks I would like to present a renewal to the mental model we’ve all been living with for at least two decades – – that is the CIA triad. This ‘triad” is one in which we’ve all taken as a matter of great faith and one in which I subscribe to emotionally.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the CIA triad – a quick review is in order as this triad is that basis for all CISSPs, CISMs and security + professionals. The idea is that the world of information security has three main principles and they are all created equal. These principles are, as stated earlier, the classic triad of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability and encompass the reason behind everything we do to control and adjust risk profiles within organizations. The triad is often shown in this sort of a format (diagram below), however you may also see it commonly displayed as a Venn-diagram variant.\nSo now, let’s talk about this model’s main problem – – first is that it treats the three areas of security as equal when in fact there are dependencies. For example, you can have availability without having confidentiality or integrity; however you cannot have confidentiality without having access to (e.g. availability to) the information you seek. Also there is clearly a dependency in which confidentiality has on integrity. That is, you cannot have confidentiality without having integrity first.\nNow, I can blow out this model ad nauseam, however the point is that there is CLEARLY a dependency here which has not been illustrated in ANY of the “Common Body of Knowledge” of a security professional and one in which I believe looks more like the following diagram:\n\nIf this is indeed a true theorem, then this dependency dramatically changes the way in which we deploy controls and information security models as priorities are assigned differently to requirements.\nIn other words, if you believe as I do, in order to have secure, confidential data, you must first have reliable and available information, then that means that confidentiality is a higher-order attainment. Yes, much like Maslow’s hierarchy of Needs helps illustrate Man’s various attainment of needs, this idea helps place into context that secure data cannot be reached until more basic forms of security are achieved.\nThe infamous anonymous group and their influx of DDOS attacks illustrate that our efforts must focus on the basic and primal needs of our organization’s availability. As security professional’s we must protect our networks from these attacks and avoid the loss of productivity, revenue and reputation.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'availability\', \'cia\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/02/in-security-information-availability-is-foundational/');

One of the leading news sites in Israel was hit by a 7 Gbps (!) traffic attack that partially shutdown its news sites, as well as its daughter sites. It was an unsophisticated, brute force attack, yet, a lethal one as it managed to completely saturate the pipe between the Internet Service Provider and the news site. The attacker recruited hundreds of bots to generate a flood of traffic that managed to bypass the CDN and directly hit the website.\nSo, how can websites and online businesses protect themselves from such volumetric DDoS attacks?\nWith the rise of the attack profile, there are many security advisors that provide recommendations to businesses on how to protect themselves.\nOne popular advice is to increase the bandwidth capacity of the pipe between the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the online business. However, there will always be enough available bots out there to saturate even a higher capacity pipe, not to mention the costs of multi-gigabit Internet connectivity to your ISP.\nAnother popular advice is to block users from foreign countries while you are under attack. Unfortunately, this is not a viable solution for two reasons: First, recruited bots can be operated from any country including your own. Second, in attacks such as we saw today, the source addresses of the attackers were spoofed, which means that you cannot identify the origin of the traffic and therefore it is impossible to filter out users from foreign countries. And besides, we want to keep the Internet open for everyone.\nFor volumetric DDoS attacks as seen today, there is only one feasible solution: Online businesses and websites must require a clean pipe service from their ISP. A clean pipe service means that the service provider blocks volumetric DDoS attacks before they enter into the business’s pipe, leaving a clean one for legitimate traffic. Once the volumetric attack enters into the business pipe, it will consume the entire bandwidth between the ISP and the business, leaving no room for legitimate users.\nSome of the leading ISPs already offer clean pipe services today utilizing advanced DDoS mitigation systems that identify volumetric attacks and automatically block non-legitimate traffic in real-time without interrupting legitimate users that are accessing the online business. During and after the attack, these service providers are capable of sharing detailed reports with their customers about the attack behavior and other relevant information. This helps ISPs to provide the required SLAs to their customers.\nThe clean pipe service is required to eliminate volumetric DDoS attacks, but it is only partial solution for online businesses that are seeking the ultimate protection, as discussed here.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'botnet\', \'CDN\', \'DDoS attack\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/02/largest-israeli-ddos-attack/');

While these numbers are easy to understand – they may be misleading to organizations that are planning for and implementing network security solutions. Radware’s 2011 Global Application & Network Security Report not only debunks DDOS myths – it serves as a guide for improving your organization’s overall security posture.\n\nIntroduction\nWhile DDoS attack numbers are easy to understand and grab the attention of the media – they do not really explain what is happening during a DoS attack or give other organizations any insight.\nReading through our 2011 Radware Global Application & Network Security Report I have learned a few things that could be considered misleading. Here are a few common myths that should be mentioned:\nThe Big Myth: Organizations Need to Prepare for Enormous Attacks\nAlthough some organizations do incur massive DDoS attacks, many more never experience a high-magnitude attack. Instead, these organizations are brought down by less intensive, but equally serious attacks.  According to our report, 76 percent of attacks were less than 1Gbps in bandwidth, with 32 percent less than 10Gbps. Only nine percent of attacks in 2011 were over 10Gbps.\n\nFigure 1 – Radware Security Report: Attacks by Bandwidth\nA review of cyber attack cases reveals that industry reports capturing public attention perpetuate a myth that only size counts. The thinking goes that if the bandwidth is bigger, then the attack is more severe.  In fact, Radware’s ERT found that the type of attack is also significant. A much smaller HTTP flood on the application level may do more damage than a larger UDP flood on the network. When evaluating DoS attacks it is important to understand both the size and type of attack.\nAlso, the proper way to measure attacks is by their bytes-per-second (BPS) and packets-per-second (PPS) properties. If the number of packets is high, the attack is more serious. Following this logic, a 10Mbps UDP flood would be more severe than a 5Mbps HTTP flood, which is not necessarily true.\n\nFigure 2 – Radware Security Report: Network versus Application by Bandwidth\n\n\n\nvar rnd = window.rnd || Math.floor(Math.random()*10e6);\nvar pid276005 = window.pid276005 || rnd;\nvar plc276005 = window.plc276005 || 0;\nvar abkw = window.abkw || \'\';\nvar absrc = \'https://servedbyadbutler.com/adserve/;ID=168379;size=0x0;setID=276005;type=js;sw=\'+screen.width+\';sh=\'+screen.height+\';spr=\'+window.devicePixelRatio+\';kw=\'+abkw+\';pid=\'+pid276005+\';place=\'+(plc276005++)+\';rnd=\'+rnd+\';click=CLICK_MACRO_PLACEHOLDER\';\ndocument.write(\'<scr\'+\'ipt src=\"\'+absrc+\'\" type=\"text/javascript\"></scr\'+\'ipt>\');\n\n\n\nWhile enormous DDoS attacks are really about network flood attacks, the majority of organizations that are targeted by sub 1Gbps attacks are targeted with a mix of network and application flood attacks. The impact of application flood attacks are much more severe than network flood attacks – it is much easier to detect and block a network flood attack (which is about sending a large volume of irrelevant traffic such as UDP floods, SYN floods and TCP floods, typically spoofed) rather than an application flood attack where the attackers are using real IP addresses from real machines and running complete application transactions – it’s the users which are not real.\nWhat is clear from figure 3 is that attackers are using multi-vulnerability attack campaigns, a mix of network and application attacks. Attackers are seeking for the blind spots in the security architecture of the victims – and pushing strongly on those attack vectors that go undetected.\n\nFigure 3 – Radware Security Report: Network and Application attacks coexists\nIn fact more attack vectors target the application resources rather than the network resources – which mandate the need for on-premises security solutions in addition to DDoS protection service that are offered by service provider.\nOther Myths\nFirewalls or IPS alone can stop DDoS attacks\nDespite being designed to provide network security, firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are impacted by DDoS attacks. Often the firewall is the weakest link.  The report shows that in 32 percent of DDoS attacks, the firewall or IPS became the bottleneck.  To stop DDoS attacks you need dedicated hardware solutions, not IPS and firewall technologies.\nContent Delivery Network (CDN) providers protect a business against DDOS attacks\nThe CDN occasionally can handle the less sophisticated, large-volume attacks by simply absorbing them (while the target customer will pay for that bandwidth, of course, as it was recognized as legitimate traffic).  However, as seen by the recent cyber attacks that tried to bring down the Israeli financial system and national airline, the CDN was easily bypassed by changing the page request in every Web transaction.  These random request techniques force CDNs to “raise the curtain” and forward all the attacks directly to the customer premise, in essence making the CDN act as a proxy unloading the attack traffic directly at the target servers.\nThe core DoS attack mitigation strategy is to defend and absorb\nBusinesses can and should have the ability to be proactive in their mitigation steps to stop malicious traffic or Website degradation with a strategy for going on the offense.  This changes the rules in which the attacker always has the edge, and instead, levels the playing field. This can be done by identifying the attack tool used as the vehicle to carry the attack campaign and expose and exploit its inherent weaknesses to neutralize the attack tool in a “passive”, non-intrusive way. \nConclusion: Recommendations from the Radware ERT\nRadware’s ERT recommends the following tactics for businesses to protect against DoS and DDoS attacks:\n\nCollect information about attacks such as type of attacks, size and frequency. Use the correct measures for the attack type. For example, the proper measurement for UDP floods is in bandwidth and PPS, while the measurement scale for HTTP floods is in transactions per second, concurrent connections, and new connections per second. \nPerform risk analysis at the business level to determine the budget you should allocate to improve your business resilience against DDoS attacks.\nFor bandwidth saturation attacks, make sure your service provider can mitigate volumetric attacks that may saturate your bandwidth. \nFor application attacks, deploy anti-DoS and network behavioral technologies on site.\nHave a consolidated or “context aware” view into enterprise security with a security event information management (SEIM) system.  An SEIM system can build a centralized architecture that simplifies such tasks as monitoring the millions of messages and log records generated by security edge devices.  Also, an SEIM is essential when prosecuting a perpetrator.\nEducation and internal security policies are important defense tools, too.  Regularly refresh technical skills and practical experience within the security group; but also help employees be aware of how hackers can exploit opportunities throughout the enterprise, especially in the age of ‘bring your own device’. \n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', 'None', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/02/ddos-attacks-myths/');

How Security Companies Can Gain Trust Back', 'Avi Chesla', '2012-1-31', 'Following recent escalation of cyber attack campaigns by the Anonymous group and most recently the pro-Palestinian “hacktivists” (Saudi Arabian hacker “0xOmar”) that tried over three days to bring down the Israeli stock market, national airline website and several major and vulnerable private banks, I am hearing more and more about online companies that are looking for Geo IP blocking capabilities. Not that I have anything against Geo IP analytics and blocking measures, however this specific requirement means that organizations have really decided to deny access to their legitimate audience.  Or, in other words, these companies are giving up as they don’t believe that their current security capabilities can really differentiate between legitimate to non-legitimate users under attack. Under pressure, they choose to simply block everything that is coming from countries they believe are not safe.\n\nWell, that means we lost for two main reasons:\n\n\nFirst, no place is really safe so Geo IP blocking will not help! DDoS Attacks can arrive from any point on the globe regardless of the real originator – we see that more and more and the most recent life example is the variants of the anonymous LOIC tool (the JavaScript variant that can be accessed from any website and be used by any web browser – not an invention but certainly an easier way to conduct these cyber attacks from anywhere and force innocent users to be unwittingly recruited into the attack). The attack sources map below, which we put together after analyzing the recent attack campaigns against Israeli sites, proves this.\n\n\n\n\nSecond and maybe most important, public online sites that were meant to be open for everyone are under siege, and prefer to deny traffic to large audiences.\n\nRadware’s Emergency Response Team was able to come in and rescue many of Israel’s major online companies while they were under attack. We were able to change the Geo IP blocking approach by designing an end to end security solution that is deployed both on the service provider side (of the protected online company) as well as on the customer premises. That approach allowed blocking these recent cyber attacks without the need to unnecessarily block legitimate traffic through methods such as GeoIP blocking.\nLimitations of Existing Tools\nGetting back to the reasons why these companies originally lost trust lies in the following operation limitations of the existing security tools:\nOn premises security solution –  On premises security equipment suffered from volumetric attacks that consumed the overall pipe which renders them, strong as they may be, useless – too late to block the attacks on the customer premises in such cases.\nService Provider Security Solution – The assumption that the service provider’s security tools can solve these recent attacks was misleading for the following main reasons:\n\nLow & Slow -security equipment on the service provider side was not able to detect and prevent the “low & slow” (sometimes called “Slow and Silent”) DoS attacks from way up there in the cloud. These attack types simply went under their radar and hit the target sites very badly (attack tools like R.U.D.Y , Socketstress, the Slowloris attack techniques and its variants and more are all part of this family of DoS threats).\nApplication level floods – Application level attacks were not effectively mitigated. The level of “intimacy” with the customer’s application that is required for effectively preventing application level attacks doesn’t exist up there in the cloud (far from the customer site.)\n\nEncrypted DoS attacks went under the radar as well – there was no way the customers would allow using their keys in the cloud.\n\nAs illustrated above, the following inherent security limitations exist on the service provider side:\n\nLow & Slow – Goes unnoticed\nEncrypted DoS attacks – Goes unnoticed\nApplication level DoS\n\nNon-tuned thresholds and lack of behavioral analysis technologies, that effectively learn the protected site’s behavior, result in ineffective protection.\nRandom request techniques force CDN’s to raise the “curtain” and forward all the attacks directly to the customer premises.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if only CPE security tools are deployed, then simple  volumetric attacks can saturate the line  and render the CPE useless, i.e., deny any traffic to the site.\nRadware’s annual security report, which is about to be released, will expose more facts about the recent attack developments.  It will prove that in the past two years all serious cyber attack campaigns include volumetric as well as the low and slow attacks vectors, both generated simultaneously.\nSolution\nTaking all these into consideration, a suggested security architecture that uses both CPE and service provider security tools to protect sites, and as long as these include all the necessary attack mitigation techniques, is the only effective way to protect sites.  A security framework that includes the customer premises as well as service provider layers of defense will gain back the trust of organizations.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'application level\', \'Cloud\', \'ddos\', \'Offensive Security\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/01/security-companies-gain-trust-back/');

Whether it is the Anonymous Group joining the Occupy Wall Street protesters to launch cyber attacks on major financial institutions in New York, or the Nightmare group, working with the hacker “0xOmar” to escalate their cyber war against Israel, cyber attacks have become the weapon of choice for âhacktivistsâ seeking to leverage the impact of conflicts and social protests.\n\nThe cyber attacks of Monday, January 16thâ on the Israeli stock market and national airline was the latest incident in a series of hacking events over the past two weeks, which have seen details of tens of thousands of Israeli credit cards posted online and websites defaced by hackers claiming to be from Saudi Arabia or Gaza. The attacks represent a new chapter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as Hamas spokesmen described them as new forms of Arab and Islamic resistance against Israeli financial interests. In both the New York and Israel episodes, while hacktivists used the cyber attack tools to leverage the impact of conflicts and social protests, their targets were the financial community which were vulnerable.\nThe Major Israeli Attacks were Application-Oriented\nA chilling aspect in Mondayâs cyber attack was the discovery that attackers are moving to the application layer, a sophistication that turns traditional distributed denial of service (DDoS) defenses useless. Volumetric DDoS attacks, like those launched by Anonymous, originally were about flooding victim sites with irrelevant network traffic. During the past year the Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) has seen an increase in Application DDoS attacks. Defending against application DDoS attacks is much tougher. Application transactions look legitimate and are generated by real IP addresses and machines â itâs the users that are not real.\nMost On-Line Enterprises are Vulnerable to Application DDoS\nAs a rule of thumb, nearly all major retail sites and most financial services defend against denial of service attacks by deploying DDoS protection from the service provider or by using Content Delivery Networks (CDN) â or a combination of both. The excessive traffic generated by attackers is mitigated using the service providersâ DDoS protection tools, or absorbed by the high capacity of the CDN provider. However, this model is proving faulty and wrought with vulnerabilities.\nISPs are NOT your friend for Anti-Application DDoS\nFor example, the internet service provider has great capability to detect and mitigate network DDoS flood attacks but (self proclaimed) has very limited capability to protect against application floods which, to an ISP, look identical to legitimate user traffic.\nNeither are CDNs!!\nOn the other hand, the CDN has problems too! CDNs are easily bypassed by changing the page request in every web transaction â content cannot be cached â making the CDN act as a proxy disembarking the attack traffic directly at the target servers. Moreover, in most cases, CDNs can unwittingly publish key external ips of customers which represent Load Balancing or other key infrastructure servers making these devices known to attackers which wouldnât otherwise have access to these device addresses.\nNo one can say for certain how all of this will play out, however given the increased frequency, directed attacks, and effectiveness of the techniques, we can safely assume the following are the key activities heading into 2012:\n\nCyber attacks go mainstream for activists and for financially motivated criminal organizations. Attackersâ motivation has evolved and from publicity and vandalism they are looking for financial gain or protest without going out of their homes.\nReassessing the risk â your organization is likely a target. For example eCommerce sites – such as Financial Services, Retailers, Top National Brands, and On-line Government Agencies & Services – which were the prime target for financially motivated attackers, become now also targets for hacktivism. In fact, many of the current victims of the Israeli attacks stated publically that they thought the issue of defense was well enough in hand with their current CDN and Internet providers.\nCyber weapon of Mass Disruption deploy multi-vulnerability DoS & DDoS attacks. This turns traditional network security measures useless, as they typically can detect and defend only some of the attack vectors.\nThe need for complementing security technologies. Mitigating multi-vulnerability and multi-vector attacks requires more than one security technology in place, adding behavioral analysis technologies on top traditional signature detection and rate based protection.\nArchitecting the perimeter for attack mitigation. Enterprises need LAYERED DEFENSES – – not a single ISP or Service Provider – – Deployment of complementing network security technology requires rethinking of perimeter security.\nDefenses are needed! Mitigation strategies are also evolving and now include active âself defenseâ strategies such as the notion of âhack backâ and âeco-system resistanceâ which includes the notion of a multi-layered approach to DDoS attacks.\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anonymous\', \'Application DDoS\', \'CDN\', \'DDoS attack\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/serviceprovider/mobilesecurity/2012/01/lesson-learned-isps-cdns-arent-enough-for-anti-ddos/');

Vast majorities of targeted organizations have been left licking their wounds and posthumously responding to numerous queries on what happened and why they weren’t protected.\n\nIn fact, so august are the perpetrators of these effective attacks that they have gotten used to just suggesting that they are going to be angry at an organization in order to get their desired behavioral changes. This was most notable recently when they put Sony, GoDaddy and Nintendo on their target lists for supporting the proposed US Privacy Act (SOPA) only to have each of these companies publically change their positions to reduce the risk of attacks.\nSo, given the efficacy of Group Anonymous and other Hacktivist organizations over the past year, I thought I would take a stab at highlighting the top six key attributes Anonymous looks to exploit in targeted victims and have listed the attributes below:\n1. Failure to consider Security-Related Availability Threats. Every certified information security professional understands the principle that ALL security related activities need to be accomplished in pursuit of one or more of the following principles: Confidentiality (e.g. Privacy), Integrity and / or Availability. That is security is DRIVEN by one or more of these principles. It is also no secret that over the past ten years that nearly all security professionals have become intimately engaged with the concepts, theorems and infrastructures required to protect organizations from Privacy and / or Confidentiality leaks, however most of these security professionals have never either thought about or experienced an Availability-based security problem. This Availability-based threat, or what we call “Attacks” is largely a foreign concept as requiring different behavior, infrastructure, reporting and actions. Therein lies the problem and opportunity for Hacktivists! Group Anonymous loves the fact that scores of security professionals fail to realize just how vulnerable their organization is to an outage from simple volumetric threats!\n2. Overreliance on Cloud / ISP Scrubbing Capabilities. “Sign up with your telecom provider and done” has been the philosophy for so many organizations for years that the idea of scrubbing enterprise-level data centers has been a remote concept. In fact, so many companies have considered DDoS a check box fulfilled by their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that they paid very little attention to both the complexity or severity of the threat until recently. Well, instead of technically illustrating how insufficient cloud-based DDoS scrubbing is in today’s world, I will leave with you the illustrations of legions of organizations who were both customers of ISP scrubbers and today have suffered some, at the very least, embarrassing, and the very worst, business debilitating outages and loss of institutional product and service integrity.\n3. Never tested internal Availability Protections / Vulnerabilities. “Conduct the Vulnerability Assessment without Causing being Service-Disrupting”…..that’s the verbiage most contracts use when letting a contract being signed with information security consultants. In other words, conduct a vulnerability assessment; however please don’t evaluate our ‘availability’ vulnerabilities. Everyone knows that for years organizations have been testing their control infrastructure in almost every way imaginable. They have been conducting technical assessments such as Penetration Tests, Network and Application Vulnerability Assessments, Code Reviews, Architecture Engineering Assessments, etc. They have also tested compliance against regulations and best practices such as GLBA, HIPAA, SOX, PCI, ISO 27001/2, HIPAA HiTECH, etc. However, what most people don’t realize is that nearly all of the results of these tests were evaluating security programs and models against threats represented by integrity and confidentiality based attacks, not availability attacks. In fact, to prove this point even further, most modern day vulnerability scanners have either removed ‘invasive’ or availability-based scans from their initial scan profiles, or have made the scans very difficult to launch by a lay person. This has resulted in a mass of organizations who are blissfully ignorantly to the vulnerabilities associated with availability attacks (e.g. Malformed UDP floods, Dictionary Attacks, Brute-Force Attacks, HTTP POST attacks, etc) and the probability of success of said attacks.\n4. Inability to Triage Attack for effective matching of priority-matched mitigation. As illustrated in the graphic below, attacks come in multiple layers and frequently in complex (e.g. many vulnerabilities packaged into one lengthy attack). Although most ISPs and Service Providers have established models to ‘scrub their pipes’ most enterprise security models do not adhere to this model and instead are set up to address each attack sequentially and without a priority assessment to properly allocate resources. Group Anonymous knows that enterprises suffer from this ‘volumetric’ attack profile and frequently bury numerous vulnerabilities into attacks with the assumptions that normal enterprises cannot distinguish between the attack types (e.g. SYN ACK floods with a SQL injection attack – ref: Sony Attacks)\n\n5. Over reliance on tools – not talent (Static Perimeter Protection Model). We all know that tools will eventually fail us – they don’t quickly evolve to match changed landscape. As with all tools, the assumptions which go into the model are often the first attack vector for a perpetrator. For example, if the enterprise does Data Loss Prevention, well then, just encrypt the traffic and this way you get around the data scrubbing model. When dealing with integrity or confidentiality a company has the luxury of after-action analysis and forensics, however when dealing with ‘Availability-based ‘attacks, organizations don’t have the luxury of long-drawn out forensics analysis. The capability to determine what is going well, and what is not going well needs to be determined in real time which means that the deployed detection and mitigation tool set needs to be closely aligned with expert technicians and engineers who can properly configure and reconfigure the tools to avoid and disrupt emerging and changing threat landscapes. Moreover, as illustrated in the slide below, expert skills in the “availability security” disciplines of Network Behavioral Analysis, DDoS Prevention, and Web Application Firewalls are in serious deficits. Hacktivists around the world understand this concept and bank on companies having no intelligent resources to counteract their advancing and evolving techniques. Organizations require instant access to a team of supremely talented individuals – – something we call our Emergency Response Team (ERT)!\n\n6. Failure to recognize / understand Application-Layer threats. Application-level is Pandora’s box for Hacktivists. Just to give you a quick example of the types of understanding of the complexity of application-layer threats, the following is a list of the questions in which all application-layer security professionals must have on hand AFTER reviewing application vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms about their applications at all times to ensure proper AVAILABILITY of their operations:\n\nHow many web serversweb applications?\nWhat type of web applications?\nHow many active connections?\nWhat are the current idle time settings for every web application?\nHow Many Transactions per Second?\nIs acceleration such as a caching used?\nDoes the web sites are public or via CDN?\nWhat is the required CPS?\nDoes the application leverage caching or not?\nIs a response check needed (e.g. Safe Reply filter)?\n\nGroup Anonymous understands how difficult it is to not only assess the vulnerabilities to a website, but also to run the website in a secure manner without making the site susceptible to a DDoS attack!\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'AMS\', \'Anonymous\', \'Anti-DoS\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Attacks\', \'Behavioral Analysis\', \'Bots\', \'ddos', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2012/01/2011-why-has-group-anonymous-been-so-successful/');

We asked him to explain how using SaaS services can be impacted by a DDoS attack.\nA lot of companies today are looking at ways to reduce costs for maintaining infrastructure and software. Because of this, Software as a Service (SaaS) has become a norm in modern business. The benefits of making this move are often worth the risks to companies, and until now there hasn’t been much issue with using hosted software solutions. But because hackers constantly adapt and change their methods, SaaS has become the next frontier of attacking companies.\nOne of the tools hackers use that we see increasing is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). You might be  aware of groups like Anonymous, Anti-Sec, LulSec, Gnosis or have heard about the number of high profile attacks on businesses in the last few years. These groups often use DDoS, which is the new frontier of attacking businesses. DDoS may come from one user in control of as little as a couple of computers to large botnets composed of hundreds of thousands of computers all over the world. And this phenomenon isn’t going away any time soon. The capability of attacking from hundreds of thousands of computers at once makes finding the original attacker a challenging task for many investigators and IT staff, alike.\nImagine what happens if after 5 failed login attempts, your account gets locked out. Has this ever happened to you?  Or, if you’re like me, have you ever had to call the help desk to get your password unlocked because you forgot it while on vacation or maybe you just forgot that recent password change you did before leaving on a trip and locked yourself out? Well hackers can take advantage of this.\nServer Cracking is a term used to define using a program to guess passwords. Pretend your e-mail address is xyzzy@mycompany.com and you use an online SaaS platform like Salesforce.com or Oracle’s CRM On Demand and your password policy says to lock accounts after 5 invalid attempts. What would happen if a competitor or malicious person were to use LinkedIn to build a database of your employees? With one e-mail address he could probably guess your schema for e-mail, right? So, then, he could create a Server Cracking routine that would solely lock your whole company out of their online service. That wouldn’t be very fun to deal with as your business can’t use the tools any longer, leading to lost revenue while you have to rely on your SaaS provider to unlock everything for you.\nNow, what would happen if you did something like tie a single sign on into that SaaS solution? I know lots of companies tie their Active Directory or LDAP directory service to single sign on solutions. What if you even went so far as to do something really insane like tie your load balancer into your single sign on infrastructure and your SaaS services? One well-placed DDoS attack could shut down everything both outside and INSIDE of your network and take your whole company down from the outside in. Imagine what kind of a mess that would be and what you might have to do even to unlock your administrator accounts from the console just to begin resetting the rest of the admin accounts and figure out what’s going on. Meanwhile, as all of this is going on, your company is DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. Would the costs of having all of your systems down be worth it then?\nOne of the things that might lead to a wake up call about using single sign on solutions and Software as a Service is to make SURE they have reputable Server Cracking Protection mechanisms and DDoS attack prevention. Because Radware’s Defense Pro is used world-wide to fight DDoS and Server Cracking, you might suggest to your SaaS provider that if they don’t have somebody like us defending them, it might be a sign that you should run far away from them until they get a handle on DDoS protection. What’s your business worth to you and what would the costs be to get a DDoS to your SaaS infrastructure?\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'ddos\', \'DDoS attack\', \'SaaS\', \'Server Cracking\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/12/the-risks-of-saas-ddos/');

Even companies that invest in the latest security infrastructure and tools soon discover that these technology-based “solutions” are short-lived.  From antivirus software to firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention systems, these solutions are, in fact, merely the most effective strategies at the time of implementation. In other words, as soon as businesses build or strengthen a protective barrier, the “bad guys” find another way to get in.\n\nAttackers are constantly changing their tactics and strategies to make their attacks and scams as damaging as possible.   The good news is that it appears that attacks and subsequent defenses are breaking down in categories which can be measured systematically.  The following areas are of a particular concern as we look towards 2012 planning for attacks:\n\nReal-Time Protection against Volumetric Attacks:   According to Wikipedia, volumetric attacks are defined as the following, “attack involves saturating the target machine with external communications requests, such that it cannot respond to legitimate traffic, or responds so slowly as to be rendered effectively unavailable. Such attacks usually lead to a server overload. In general terms, DoS attacks are implemented by either forcing the targeted computer(s) to reset, or consuming its resources so that it can no longer provide its intended service or obstructing the communication media between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately.”  2011 has seen a dramatic rise in the growth of these attack types and even more ominous is the procurement of more capable ‘weapon systems’ or new application-based tools from which attacks can be launched. The following is a list to consider when making certain you are covering your basis in this category:\n\nTCP SYN floods\nTCP SYN+ACK floods\nTCP FIN floods\nTCP RESET floods\nTCP Fragment floods\nUDP floods\nICMP floods\nIGMP floods\nPacket Anomalies\nKnown DoS tools\n\nApplication Layer (L7) Availability Protections:  Malware is morphing in scale, scope and delivery payloads.  It has managed to renew itself as a top concern related to protecting your organization in 2012 and has emerged as an imminent threat to Organizational Availability. In fact, attackers have shifted away from mass distribution of a small number of threats to micro distribution of large families of threats. These new strains of malware consist of millions of distinct threats that mutate as they spread rapidly.   In this category, the following is a list of attacks worthy of considering when choosing protection mechanisms for your enterprise:\nReal-time protection against: \n\nBot-originated and direct application attacks\nHTTP GET page floods\nHTTP POST floods\nCustomized / Additional HTTP Method attacks\nHTTP uplink bandwidth consumption attacks\nDNS query floods (A, MX, PTR,…)\nBrute Force Attacks (HTTP, Telnet, POP3, IMAP, etc.,)\n\nAdvanced behavioral application monitoring:\n\nHTTP servers real time statistics and baselines\nDNS server real time statistics and baseline\n\nService Denials & Behavioral Protections:  Trusted Web sites are the focus of a large portion of malicious activity.   As more and more users go online to take advantage of Web 2.0 applications — like social-networking sites, blogs, and wikis — authors of ‘hacking and cracking’ software are right behind them, opening up yet another front in the constant cat-and-mouse game between security defenses and hackers.  These threats will become increasingly important with younger workforces who are proficient with these tools.   To thwart these attack types consider very strong protections against these categories of attacks or threats:\n\nHTTP servers\nWeb vulnerability scans\nBruteforce \nSIP servers (TCP & UDP)\nSIP spoofed floods\nPre-SPIT activities\nSIP scanning\nSMTP/IMAP/POP3,FTP,etc\nApplication Bruteforce\nApplication scans\n\nIPS & Reputation Services:  The continued high volume of Hacktivist attacks underscored the importance of various signature prevention technologies to prevent proper exploitation of an evolving tool landscape.   In fact, the heavy reliance on tools as part of Hacktivist attacks have ironically exposed the over-reliance on the perimeter model of deployed security devices without IPS technologies on the VERY edge.  Most DDoS Providers do not rely on signatures and frequently fail to uncover newly developed attack tools, and most IPS providers suggest deployments of their tools to deep in the infrastructure for them to be meaningful to stop attacks at the perimeter.   The following is a shopping list of things to consideration when procuring IPS & Reputational Management solutions to prevent perimeter attacks: \nSignatures Protection against: \n\nApplication Vulnerabilities and exploits\nWeb, Mail, DNS,  databases, VoIP\nOS Vulnerabilities and exploits \nMicrosoft, Apple, Unix based\nNetwork Infrastructure Vulnerabilities \nSwitches, routers and other network  elements vulnerabilities \nMalware \nWorms, Bots, Trojans and Drop-points, Spyware \nAnonymizers\nIPv6 attacks \nProtocol Anomalies \n\nSecurity Operation Center \n\nLeading vulnerability security research team\nWeekly and emergency signature updates\n\nNetwork scanning and malware propagation Protections:  As mentioned above in the Application-focused problem of bots and malware, the very same categorical problem exists at the network layer, however this time it is as equally as important to protect the internal environment as well as the external in real time.  The following is a list of network protection considerations:\n \n\nBehavioral Real-time protection against Zero-Minute Malware Propagation and network scans:\nUDP spreading worms detection\nTCP spreading worms detection\nHigh and low rate network scans \nScanning/spreading pattern identification\nInfected source identification \n\n\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'2012 Information Security\', \'AMS\', \'attack mitigation\', \'Buying DDoS\', \'ddos\', \'DDoS Checklist\', \'D', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/11/2012-considerations-before-buying-an-attack-mitigation-system/');

Then they launch the attacks, and afterwards, the smart ones at least, will hide the evidence.\nThe firewall was born to provide basic access control measures for online businesses, which were exposed to the rest of the world once connected to the internet.  Then came the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), which look for specific application vulnerability exploits.  Additional protection layers include antivirus software or gateways, web security, web application firewall (WAF), network behavioral analysis (NBA), DoS Protection – and the list may almost be endless.\n \nThe economical aspect of cyber war\nIn IT security, a layered approach is considered the best option.  There is the perimeter (that some claim is dead with mobile computing), application security layers, De-Militarized Zone, etc.  The more tools deployed, the better the security posture.\nBut just like physical war, there is a price for every tool and every protection layer.  The more tools businesses add, the higher the CapEx and OpEx needed to finance.\n \nA closer look: Fighting multi-vulnerability attacks\nAttackers employ multi-vulnerability attacks campaigns, which target the application infrastructure in several layers — the network layer, the server layer and the application layer.  Attackers are aware that even when their targets deploy network security tools, they typically deploy a firewall and IPS.  Running multiple attack vectors that aim for multiple vulnerabilities of the target IT infrastructure is highly destructive, as even if only one of the attack vectors infiltrates, the business is severely damaged.  More info on multi-vulnerability attack trend and techniques can be found on the Security Incidents Report 1H2011 website.\nTo fight the multi-vulnerability attack campaigns, IT or security managers have to invest in additional security layers including DoS Protection, NBA, WAF, and maybe more.  For online businesses, a reasonable ROI per security product deployment is within one year for a three-year product lifecycle.  So the IPS return on investment (ROI) is one year.  If you add DoS Protection, it will take you two years to achieve ROI.  Adding NBA, WAF, Anti-virus GW, URL filtering and so on will get your ROI far beyond three years.  Financially, it’s a fight that you may not be able to win.  You either invest in security more than you gain, or if you do not, your business runs the risk of being shut down by damage due to cyber attacks, and possibly even by authorities due to non-compliance.\n \nRethinking point security solution\nThe multi-vulnerability attacks case is an example of how cyber warfare is not only about technologies and processes, it’s about the money.  Can you afford this war?  The attackers typically invest a fraction of the victim’s investment.\nPerhaps it is time to rethink the layered security approach.  Selecting best-of-breed tools is a good practice in an ideal world.  In the real world, where you need to keep the doors – and website — to your business open, you may need to adopt another approach.  Ask yourself, ‘What is the most effective shield that I can afford?’  This is where the integrated approach is needed, preferably with a good security information event manager (SIEM).\nDeploying an integrated DDoS attack mitigation system that provides several protection modules including IPS, NBA, DoS Protection, and maybe WAF with an integrated SIEM, can save significantly the overall costs.  But its main advantage is the ability to detect emerging threats inherently, thus allowing the security manager to update the security posture gradually with no need to deploy new tools.  The point is in the ability to detect emerging threats and attempts.\n \nSummary\nIf we take the example of a typical attacker, they gather information prior to launching the attacks.  An integrated system with an effective SIEM will allow the security manager to identify the information gathering stage and modify the protection rules for future attack attempts.  By detecting the attacks at an early, probing stage, you not only save on possible damage, but you also save on tools that may be needed once the attack is launched – to mitigate it.  And that will keep your business open to fight another day.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', 'None', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/11/the-hacking-eco-system/');

This new “Hacktivism “category will go down in the record books as one of the most active periods of cyber attacks in the history of information security. Moreover, given the current efficacy of these ideological-based multi-vulnerability attacks such as WikiLeaks revenge attacks (December 2010) and Sony DDoS & MySQL attacks (May / June 2011), etc, we believe this will only serve to encourage even more actors to enter the picture and spawn a vicious cycle of future malicious activity.\nNo one can say for certain how all of this will play out, however given the increased frequency, directed attacks, and effectiveness of the techniques, we can safely assume the following are the key activities heading into 2012:\n1. Cyber attacks go mainstream for activists and for financially motivated criminal organizations. Attackers’ motivation has evolved and from publicity and vandalism they are looking for financial gain or protest without going out of their homes.\n2. Reassessing the risk – your organization is likely a target. For example eCommerce sites, which were the prime target for financially motivated attackers, become now also targets for hacktivism.\n3.Cyber weapon of Mass Disruption deploy multi-vulnerability DoS & DDoS attacks. This turns traditional network security measures useless, as they typically can detect and defend only some of the attack vectors.\n4 The need for complementing security technologies. Mitigating multi-vulnerability and multi-vector attacks requires more than one security technology in place, adding behavioral analysis technologies on top traditional signature detection and rate based protection.\n5.Architecting the perimeter for DDoS attack mitigation.

It was a very interesting trip, dedicated to the launch of the Radware Attack Mitigation System.\nWhat really stood out to me were all the interesting discussions around the changes in the threat landscape. This year has been a very intense year as far as successful attack campaigns go.  Some high-profile ones included The Playstation Network data breach, RSA breach and the Epsilon data breach, just to name a few. But in all these discussions, it was clear that what customers really want is a way to effectively secure their companies against similar threats and to have someone to turn to when an attack occurs.\n\nAttack Characteristics\nThe truth is, as more attacks occurred, we learned more and more about the tools and strategies hackers used on regular basis. To highlight this knowledge, I mentioned the recent security research published by the Radware Emergency Response Team (ERT) when talking to customers. The ERT group built conclusions based on the consolidated attack data that they researched and were exposed to. The ERT’s findings included:\n\nMore than 70% of the attacks this year were multi-vulnerability attacks targeting different layers of the data center from the network infrastructure to servers and applications, making them difficult to mitigate\nMotivation behind the attacks were either hacktivism for a political cause or attacks that were done for financial gain\n“Slow” attacks using a relatively low number of connections remain a serious threat\n\nBut it’s hard to know this without the aide of qualified professionals who are willing to help at a moment’s notice.\n\nFinding a Friend\nAnd in talking with customers, besides having effective security, it was also clear that they wanted to know they would have help if an attack does occur. That way, they’re not alone when they need someone the most. This means they’re not just asking which technology to deploy, but also “whom will I turn to for help, if an attack does occur?”\nIt was a very powerful realization for the customers I spoke with when they realized they would have that assistance. The ERT team, which is “on call” 24/7 to support any of our customers who are experiencing an attack, has a tremendous value, and can be that “friend” in time of need.\nThis is not only because this is a group of security experts that has an extensive “combat” experience fighting today’s attacks. Or not only because they can research and give customers an advanced notice that they are about to be attacked. But also because it assures they’re not alone in their time of need.\nThat’s a comforting feeling when going to battle in cyber-space.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'attack mitigation\', \'Counter Attack\', \'DDoS attack\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/10/a-friend-in-need/');

Defense, Offense, Both?', 'Carl Herberger', '2011-8-2', 'Boy the world has gotten complicated to defend hasn’t it? The old adage, “information security is very basic” turns out not to be true after all! As a youthful entrant into this industry I can remember my CISSP instructors telling me that “at the end of the day all you are doing is protecting the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the enterprise you support”, how hard can that be after all? Wow, if it were only that simple!\n\nThe last twelve months will go down in the record books. These past months are shattering all sorts of ‘norms’ from the size and scope of security attacks, to the effectiveness of the attack types to the egregiousness of the motives – – it’s safe to say that today’s environment isn’t your father’s internet! Now, as the world witnesses all of these attacks and fervently begins asking themselves questions of what to do and how to protect themselves we, as security professionals, must join in asking these questions and dig deeper at asking even more. One of these questions might be to investigate the noteworthy lessons from these attacks and corresponding architecture changes required. Afterall, isn’t it true that some companies have been able to withstand the attack while others went down? Why? Who had the better defense? Was Defense enough? Was ‘offense’ required?\nAs you can tell, one of the deep unanswered questions being asked is whether or not enterprise information security includes only provisions for defense? You see, as it turns out most of the recent DDoS / SQL-Injection related attacks fell into one of the following three categories:\n\nCategory #1: They were EFFECTIVE – – They caused the intended outage set out to do\nCategory #2: They were Partially Effective – – Caused the victim company dramatic problems, but short of outage\nCategory #3: They were Ineffective – – No real effect on victim\n\nMost of us would desire to be in the last category after going through attacks like these – – but do our programs mimic the strategies and tactics leveraged by successful organizations? Now, this is where we need quick after-action analyiss to figure out what are the common denominators which define success.\nAs it turns out, Category #3 organizations, in almost all cases, had not relied on pure defense alone, but rather had internally developed or partnered with companies to assist them to essentially ‘fight back’ or produce a counter-attack capability to thrust the attackers into a mode of operation which caused them to abandon their fight.\nWow! How about that analysis!! So, let’s dig deeper into this concept.\nAs we know, in a real armed conflict, defensive forces are never designed or reasonably considered to be able to withstand an attack indefinitely. The idea is so obvious it almost defies explanation, however, among the reasons whereby a long-term defensive operation is a losing strategy are as follows:\n\nLimited Resources: the amount of resources required to absorb an attack & resupply\nMaintaining Performance Levels: In a war of attrition, endurance is king\nMorale and “Espirit-de-corps:” People can be demoralizing with no progress to show.\n\nMost successful military strategists are long aware that in order to beat an enemy you must take the battle to them.\nSo, the whole point in our new lessons learned, is that the information security professional is beginning the process of integrating tried-and-tested physical defense and fighting strategies into the cyber world! Yes, it makes sense that in an organization has the ability to defend against persistent and sustained attacks, however, only so long as to absorb or “hold” the attacker/enemy until such time whereby you can launch a sustained offensive operation – if need be. As a matter of fact, most military strategists agree that the front line of defense in every real battlefield will eventually be breached. This assumption is also true in the realm of the information security battle of defense.\nBottomline: Defense alone is no longer a winning strategy and some form of offensive self-protection must be integrated into future information security operations to ensure adequate enterprise protection. Defense and attack ‘absorbtion’ alone will fail the best programs.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'Anti-DoS\', \'Counter Attack\', \'DDoS attack\', \'Defensive Security\', \'IPS\', \'Next Generation Security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/08/does-security-defense-or-offense/');

When under attack, this process is important to identify the attacker and safely distinguish it from legitimate traffic, and in turn to accurately employ various mitigation techniques to block it. After the attack is over, forensic is important for our customers to understand the attack origin, motivation, preparation for a second strike, and as a basis for legal actions. Our research team values forensic as a research tool that improves our understanding of the DoS attack world.\nIn some cases forensics is easy, for example, if the attacker uses a known tool such as the old JUNO then it is easy to detect it with a signature. The signature is based on its known and unique characteristics, and the logs of the signature will bring the list of IPs that attacked you.\nIn other cases this is far less easy – it is hard to confidently say that one IP is an attacker and another IP is legitimate. In HTTP floods, attackers’ ambition is to mimic legitimate traffic. We see attacks in which each attacker sends only few requests per second (less even than a legitimate one), the HTTP request is complete, URLs are randomized, and on top of all of that, there is more than just one attack vector. When attacking traffic and legitimate traffic blends together, the isolation process becomes a headache.\nIn one of the cases Radware recently handled, we encountered this exact difficulty but found an interesting way to overcome it. In short, the idea is to find an Archimedean Point – a small list of attackers that you are absolutely certain about, and then setup mutual parameters to gradually gain more confidence and increase the list.\nIn this attack, from the beginning we noticed that many of the HTTP requests had an HTTP Header “Accept-Language“ set with “zh-cn” indicating that browsers support Traditional Chinese. This can sometimes suggest an attack, but we need more information to confirm that because perhaps the website simply has a large Chinese speaking user base.\nWe then turned to a different parameter – we saw that some of the IPs that appeared during the attack came from the same network. In fact, when we sorted them, we saw that they were nearly consecutive and that a whole network range participated in the attack. Apparently the attacker gained access to a whole network range and utilized it in this attack. Now we were certain, the traffic coming from this network range with consecutive IPs cannot be legitimate, and we compiled the first list of attackers. It was small one, but it had a high confidence rate.\nThen we noticed that there were additional network ranges that participated in the attack. They were not as bold and obvious as the first one, but since we already knew that attacker proved himself to utilize a whole network range, we felt confident the other ones were also malicious. Our attacker list then becomes bigger.\nWe still had many IPs that used the Traditional Chinese, but did not belong to an infected network. So how do we separate the malicious ones as well? It was actually rather easy: since all the already confirmed attackers used Traditional Chinese we reasonably deduced that all or most of the other ones are attackers as well. Our attacker list becomes bigger again, until complete.\nThis process modestly follows Sherlock Holmes footsteps in two aspects: first of all, in the forensic process you need to remember not to jump to conclusions, and the second one is carefully examine the evidence and deduce from the first small conclusion to the next bigger one.\n \nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'DoS\', \'flood attacks\', \'forensic\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/08/dos-attack-forensic/');

The goal: To prepare services for IPv6 and ensure a successful transition as IPv4 address space runs out.\nI expected this day to pass successfully, with only a few operational issues that would probably be resolved that day. The question I got from people was whether the day was going to be the attackers’ day as well? My answer: Definitely not! Attackers will launch new attacks only once IPv6 usage will become significant.\nSo what should you – an ecommerce site, or anyone else running service using IPv6 – do before ramping up a new service layer? Here is what you should know about IPv6 threats:\n1.    Non-compliant security equipment\nMost vendors today claim to have IPv6-ready security products. Are they? Many offer a special version that supports IPv6 or require a license to operate it. But even if IPv6 support is enabled, one needs to carefully learn how they operate. For example:\n\nFirewalls may simply forward IPv6 traffic uninspected (instead of dropping it as the non-IPv6 version used to)\nIPv6 traffic may bypass deep packet engines, which are hardware components that may not support IPv6 traffic, resulting in the evasion of attacks\nIPv6 headers are four times bigger than IPv4, which may slow down the processing of traffic significantly\n\n2.    IPv6 is complex to administer\nHave you ever seen an IPv6 address? Do you have the experience to configure firewall rules to allow or block IPv6 traffic? How do you treat IPv6 traffic tunneled over IPv4? Do you know that the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is now embedded into the IPv6 protocol? These are only few questions which may determine a company’s ability to effectively protect their network servers.\n3.    IPv6 vulnerabilities\nManagers of IPv6 networks must be aware of the protocol’s vulnerabilities. The designers of IPv6 understood the need for network security and included mandatory IPSec in the basic protocol definition. However, recent experiences with network attacks have shown that IPSec does not address all vulnerabilities of an IPv6 network. Bugs, design flows and protocol weaknesses are inherent to IPv6, which is by far more complex than IPv4. It will take time for application vendors to fix and patch IPv6 vulnerabilities; therefore, one needs an IPS vendor which not only supports IPv6 traffic forwarding but also includes stateful signatures set to patch IPv6-based systems.\n4.    IPv6 tunnels\nIPv6 traffic can be tunneled over IPv4 using several type of tunnels (Teredo, 6to4, ISATAP). Attackers can exploit IPv6 tunnels to infiltrate cloak attacks, knowing that tunneled IPv6 packets look like normal IPv4 traffic. One needs to explicitly verify with firewall and IPS vendors that they can perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) into IPv6 tunneled traffic to examine the contents. There is a large gap between IPS and firewalls – those that “support IPv6” and those which really perform DPI of IPv6.\n5.    Rogue IPv6 devices\nThe stateless auto-configuration capabilities that are built into IPv6 allow an attacker to define a rogue device that assigns IP addresses to all other devices on a network. Smart attackers can set up a rogue network device that acts as an IPv6 router to sniff, modify or drop traffic – without the system administrator even knowing about it.\n6.    IPv6 encryption\nSimilar to SSL encryption, IPv6 includes a built-in encryption mechanism. While the encryption was designed to provide authentication and confidentiality to the communications between clients and servers, it also enables attackers to use encrypted tunnels to deliver attacks directly to the server – bypassing inspection by firewalls and IPSs – which cannot inspect encrypted content.\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'IPv6 threats\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/08/ipv6-threats/');

They were either attacks at the network perimeter – such as high-volume Denial of Service (DoS) attacks at the network level – or attacks at the critical-infrastructure level (RADIUS, Diameter, LDAP servers, etc.) – which means targeted DNS or HTTP traffic attacks. Well, the mobile security landscape is now changing, introducing a new attack vector – mobile clients!\n\nWith the recent advancements of both 3G mobile networks and smart-phones (read: iPhone/Android devices), any mobile user has mobile broadband connectivity and enjoys an open OS with many downloadable applications – that can be also mobile attack tools. The combination of these presents a new reality; a reality in which virtually any mobile user can become a potential attacker! The result – as you can guess by now – mobile operators are increasingly getting concerned about that.\nProbably the most interesting fact to point out is that this new breed of mobile attacks is omni-directional, i.e. mobile to network, network to mobile (often initially triggered by a mobile attacker) as well as mobile to mobile (M2M). M2M attacks are the trickiest; as the mobile attacker will exploit the mobile core network resources and use its services (SMS, MMS, sending data, etc.) to attack other clients on its network. The impact of hand-held mobile device as a source or destination for attacks may vary from just annoying battery draining attacks to network paging overflow attacks, resulting in network disruption. But they can also include a complete mobile network breakdown. This could definitely make one quite nervous, huh?\nFrom the mobile operator angle, it is essential to deploy the full means of protection against such multi-vector attacks, by utilizing a security attack mitigation solution that will defend not only the mobile network, but also its clients at the perimeter, critical infrastructure level and mobile device layers. Specifically, it is cruicial to detect on-the-fly “mis-behaving users” that can potentially become concrete attackers.\nSo next time your iPhone battery starts to drain too quickly, unless you downloaded some battery-intensive application (which is a totally different probelm…) – your mobile device might just be under attack!\nUntil next time,\nNir\nShare this:TwitterLinkedInFacebookGoogl', '\'iPhone\', \'M2M\', \'Mobile Security\', \'security\'', 'https://blog.radware.com/security/2011/07/mobile-security-top-things/');

The proposal outlined the universal regulations that all organizations should be required to adhere to in the case of a data breach. The recommendations included:\n\nThe implementation of one system for all organizations to follow to share information about data breaches. In order to do this, the administration proposes that penalties are removed for organizations that report ongoing data breaches to the Department of Homeland Security.\nAn allowance for organizations to build data centers wherever they’d like, removing the current requirement in certain states that data centers must be built within their state of operation.\nOne governing cybersecurity  law for all states to follow.\n\n\nAll of the recommendations outlined in Obama’s proposal are a step in the right direction, but most organizations want to prevent a breach or attack from happening in the first place. In addition, should a breach occur, it’s critical that immediate action is taken in order to reduce overall impact. Oftentimes when an organization turns to the government to take action against an attack, it’s already too late and data has been compromised on a large scale. An unfortunate recent example is Sony, when a data breach into one network turned into the second largest breach of all-time.\n \nIn an effort to assist organizations in developing a top-level offensive strategy, we’ve created a list of tips that all online businesses should implement as a guideline for fighting cybercrime and protecting their networks:\n \n\nKnow your average website traffic and usage habits.  Behavioral analysis tools will allow you to build a profile of your site’s normal traffic patterns. They’ll also create a behavior pattern of the users accessing online services\nLook for any deviations from the normal behaviors. Having a way to detect abnormalities will allow you to quickly see if a Botnet attack has occurred.\nIsolate the transactions of users who raise your suspicion. This will allow you to block the user at the network’s perimeter and give you time to analyze traffic or unusual transactions.\nAnalyze the attack tool. This will enable you to identify weaknesses.\nCreate an offensive. Create a method that will exploit the attack’s weaknesses to deactivate the tool wherever located, thus cleaning the ‘bad traffic’ end-to-end beyond the perimeter borders.\nMeasure the effectiveness of the attack offensive. Assess the tools used to stop the botnet or intruder, and adjust if necessary.\n\n \nUtilizing this strategy empowers organizations to take the proper steps in the case of an attack to ensure minimal damage.\n \nWhat do you think of Obama’s cybersecurity plan?
